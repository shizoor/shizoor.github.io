1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
The rest of the day, I saw a lot of people get a phone.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,900
Reverend Howe, Gigbo, let's hear about that radio show.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,300
Amazing, isn't it? Listen.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,260
I'm wondering about that voice we heard on the radio.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,820
I think, hmm, the color of these hot butter rum martinis.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
I'd like to talk about...

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,560
And here's the only person listening to the show tonight.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,100
Yeah, I'm coming.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,340
Okay, good.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,340
Look at this surface seething and bubbling.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,640
There's enormous bubbles popping.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,580
See, the rest of our listeners are machines like this one.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,480
Look up at the top.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,240
They've made so much money in their regular day jobs

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,540
that they were able to fend off these legal problems for years.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,960
Rely on your intelligence and on your memory.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,940
And think about the case as it was.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,880
To help you say the underlying word correctly.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,780
But how many of you are really genuine?

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,620
And the intelligent?

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,980
So there.

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,180
Bang.

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,880
Put a dual display on.

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,080
Uh, uh, over to you, uh, uh, puzzling.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:09,480
Hey.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:09,800
Kill me.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,520
Huh?

28
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,600
Kill me.

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,840
Kill me.

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,820
Kill me!

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,160
Okay, why not?

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,420
Good luck.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,660
Yeah!

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,040
Oh, uh, no, in fact, I'm not ready at all.

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:43,780
Uh, uh, uh, I am, uh, and I, uh, I, uh, oh, goodness me, uh, I have no idea how I, uh,

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,320
I came by this number.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,780
I've, I'm at present having the numbers, um, uh, Dr. Howe.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,300
I mean, uh, I don't sound like him at all.

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,700
I know.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,660
I'm presently having phone numbers dialed at random.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,900
Bye.

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm a scumbag person who I'm allowing to, uh, use my phone at the present time, and

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,100
he is, uh, taking over everything and dialing up people and appears to be dialing up doctors

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,080
of the air for some strange reason.

45
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,100
I guess him being a phone person, he can do that.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,980
Um, it's too bad I couldn't talk to you under letter context because I am, in fact, a great

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:28,000
fan of the subgenius church, and, um, but my friend, when I mentioned that, began dialing

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
these numbers and putting me on the phone and then running away, and I am extremely annoyed

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,360
by all this.

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,700
However, he is no friend of mine, and I hope sincerely you will do your best to erase your

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,480
memory of all this and can merely continue to make the shows as bad as you can and abuse

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,160
the callers and listen for Guy the caller because he will be waiting to be abused more

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,680
than the rest.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:50,980
Woo!

55
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,500
Woo!

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,540
There we go.

57
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
There's a universe somewhere.

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,580
Somewhere out there where there's...

59
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,700
A show?

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,880
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,480
The subgenius hour of...

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,280
What?

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,380
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,120
Infinite number of puzzling evidences.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,580
Infinite numbers of phylos and stirrers.

66
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,740
There's a huge studio here.

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,560
And a huge...

68
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,500
There's a huge studio here at KPFA.

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,900
Well, we have to have a huge studio and have infinite people with an infinite number of

70
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,220
mouths and heads.

71
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,400
Like shows.

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,780
All spooky.

73
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,640
And they never shut up.

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,080
What's the deal?

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,120
There he is.

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,800
Okay, now, phylo's gone crazy in production studio one.

77
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,260
Looks like they're isolating the area.

78
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,220
Pulling the doctors out of there.

79
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,080
Well, they don't have long to live here on KPFA.

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,820
I can tell you that.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,020
It's violent.

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Horror here on...

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,560
8484425.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,840
8484425.

85
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,460
9374.

86
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:02,980
9374.

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:02,980


88
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,500
Hello?

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,900
From across the nation they came and they saw.

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,800
A new world begin in Northern Arkansas.

91
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,300
They grow with storms and heralds of night.

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,240
To their new awakening and dark, dark inside.

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,660
They share a deep, deep love.

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,180
And they...

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,340
Another opportunity.

96
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,920
A new world began.

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,220
One they give to the masses.

98
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:47,140
Another day off and to another day off.

99
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,600
Still we're out to start this protocol.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,140
We wanna see those fucking suits scrap business.

101
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,140


102
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:54,780


103
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,520
Then what did these national confirmation готовingcha term a bomb?

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,840
And then the ideal you had are.

105
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,220
Aύ dragon.

106
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,260
When they plopped the mushrooms to commune with nature

107
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,700
How are we to know we'd have to move our ship later?

108
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,720
Five hundred colors flashed into my brain

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,900
My self-admiration occurred in three or four planes

110
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,040
My brain was blasted, my head feeling fixed

111
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,180
My eyeballs were pruning but I didn't get sick

112
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,440
We packed up my piss, but we kept seeing dots

113
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,700
Till we found that the peak had gotten all the best spots

114
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,040
So we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

115
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,940
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,580
The people were happy, they were all having fun

117
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,880
While Dr. Stabob was farming skulls in the sun

118
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,100
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound

119
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,360
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,560
The band that they're not was speaking his name

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,940
While his doctors on the clamshell were claiming their fame

122
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,020
Sparkdog explosion and combo gang fun

123
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,040
Finish this then, just in time for lunch

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,320
And we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

125
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,340
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

126
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:23,860
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,620
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

128
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,240
We're gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,340
Better make it to Dark, Dark, or just give up hope

130
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,320
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,700
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear

132
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,860
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm gonna go back, to smoke the ultimate frown

134
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,260
Get a chance, I'm mad

135
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,360
And I'll show you what it's like to be a gold

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,660
When reality's on hold, and Dark, Dark can go

137
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,060
We got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

138
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:16,700
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

139
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:25,560
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:54,600
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dark, Dark Mountain

141
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
And we'll have it in...

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,160
Ohhhhh!

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Yes, dear friends.

144
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,620
Doctor Drummond can't tell you everything else he did

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,980
because you just don't even wanna know

146
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,120
The swinging love corpses

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,360
there are live somewhere from the album

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,540
Soak your Butt

149
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,280
Help...

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,280
Ha ha!

151
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,240
And, well, at last, we've been defending the Church of the Subgenius so much

152
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,640
so lightly, we're just gonna tear it to pieces tonight

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
You know, that mean it's one of those

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,380
old-fashioned doctor shows

155
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,420
all, you hear it be heard from all over the world

156
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,120
those mighty nasty characters, particularly Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell. The show opened,

157
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,900
by the way, with a nice little new edit by Puzzling Evidence. There's a lot more of that

158
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,560
coming up.

159
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,120
Oh, yeah.

160
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,780
Oh, okay. But you know what the problem is? I've been getting tired, tired of these tax

161
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:08,560
and spend Republicans. They're always kowtowing to the special interest groups. Really, it

162
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,100
kind of makes you sick. The tax the poor, spend on the rich, and the tax the poor.

163
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,340
And all their little special interest groups they have to have, like Westinghouse, and

164
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,200
GE, and Mobile Oil, and Lilly Pharmaceuticals, and McDonnell Douglas, and the War on Drugs,

165
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,880
and the Secret Police, and Sununu's Jet. Tax and spend, tax and spend, that's all you ever

166
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,660
hear from people like Rush Limbaugh. Spend, spend, spend, so the weapon companies can

167
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,520
defend brave democracies like Kuwait. Or else they say, no, no more taxes, only spending

168
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,840
cuts.

169
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,100
But you understand?

170
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,320
I wanted this job so bad. We're just going to let you decide what to cut. We're not going

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,600
to tell you. Except that you can't cut abortions for poor people. I mean, you have to cut abortions

172
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,080
for poor people. You've got to cut that because we need more ignorant millions roaming the

173
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,280
streets buying our cigarettes and liquor that our companies are subsidized to make.

174
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,920
Oh, yes. And on top of that, I noticed that the American people are a lot more,

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,660
uh, upset about, uh, women liberals dodging social security taxes for their nannies than

176
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,260
they ever got upset about the Iran-Contra cover-ups and stuff. And I sure am glad you

177
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:30,380
people have your priorities straight. And gays in the military. Oh, yeah, gays. Yeah,

178
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,380
well, God forbid we ever admit they've been there all along, although why they wouldn't

179
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,840
want to keep the exemption is, uh, beyond me. Hell, I tried to use it. They were going

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,880
to send me to Vietnam, and I told them, please!

181
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,140
I want to be a gay in the military! I'm a bisexual drug addict! I... uh... and the

182
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,600
draft guy just laughed and laughed and told me he'd heard that story five times already

183
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
that day from regular ordinary hippies like me. And see? They've got you coming and going,

184
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,180
dear friends. They've got you... they've got you coming and going.

185
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,860
Uh-oh. Looks like we have a... looks like an EPA problem out there. It looks like the

186
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,720
Earth is spinning out of control from the camera in here.

187
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,540
I'm right there. I'm right on top of you. If you look to the, uh, uh, lower than the

188
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,940
ceiling, you'll see my, uh, the draft guy.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,180
Oh, there he is, yeah. Okay, most of Earth can wave to you now. About half of Earth can

190
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,500
wave. There they are. They're all waving and pointing their headlights up at you.

191
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,300
Come on, give me a clear landing signal, or I've got to get down and storm you on the

192
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,520
shelf.

193
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,540
Okay, well, uh, here... here's the beacon.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,860
Uh, repeat that. That didn't come in. Repeat that. Didn't come in. I'll tell you. I'll tell

195
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,500
you. You're about to land and see before the end melts. Over.

196
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,500
Uh, okay, there's, uh, more beacon. Watch out for little alien pods behind your, uh,

197
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,580
flight suit there.

198
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,020
There must be interference in my KPFA on terror. All I'm getting is that it sounds

199
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,700
like a TV commercial from the 1950s. I need your landing signal. Over.

200
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,460
Uh, that's the... the beam. We use, uh, old TV. Beam back to Earth from aliens.

201
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,280
Well, I'm sick of it. I want to see a modern TV show with, uh, pornography, violence, and,

202
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,260
uh, you know, everything.

203
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,420
Yeah, but you don't understand. America's really changed now. It's different.

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,280
One in America in ten is on food stamps.

205
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,040
Assembly line jobs in the main state of the American middle class are going abroad or being replaced by machines.

206
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,060
All of America's changing since you've come back.

207
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,060
But what about the five-part national plan to contain the budget deficit by taxing the upper income bracket?

208
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,320
Hundreds of thousands of defense industry workers fear layoffs.

209
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Their highly honed skills no longer applicable.

210
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,580
Bridges, highways, and airports are rotting.

211
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,920
Americans consume too much and save and invest too little.

212
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,640
Yeah, I know, Hal, but we have problems down here.

213
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:06,060
Well, welcome back to the tiniest little planet in the universe.

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
Standing by, turn on artificial gravity, and...

215
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
Oh, sorry, I had it up too high.

216
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,220
See what happens. I'm sorry about that.

217
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,140
We smushed them against the bulkhead there.

218
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,020
We really didn't mean to have that much power, but here we're back on Earth now.

219
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,960
What happened in there?

220
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,460
What happened in there?

221
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,940
Well, the gravity was on, and the ground was so hard, it's cold.

222
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
It must be just...

223
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,340
I love it when they do that.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,320
Are they still in contact?

225
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,060
We can see the pod on the ground there, but we're not sure if they're alive.

226
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,620
Hey, Ted, take a look.

227
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,620
I'm going to pop the hat.

228
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,240
See if you can see me from where you're sitting.

229
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,160
Oh, there he goes.

230
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,480
Ah, just breathe.

231
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,040
Hey, look who we have.

232
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,920
And it's a triumphant moment here at 11 minutes to 5 in the morning

233
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,780
as Earth settles down peacefully to another dawn.

234
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,900
Well, in a little while.

235
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
It's a day, right?

236
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Yeah, this is a day that lasts forever.

237
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,800
Dennis, you're all set to go?

238
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,400
So, I don't know. They better do something fast.

239
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,400
You take it time to...

240
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,220
And what happens to it's going to happen to you?

241
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,580
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go,

242
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,400
no one's ever walked up to me and say,

243
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,640
hey, you want to buy some cigarettes?

244
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,600
Acuérdeme, Rubén, al ratito.

245
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
De qué me don't redelfo?

246
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,000
De meterlo al toilet.

247
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,480
Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.

248
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,260
Can't sit and negotiate.

249
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,080
Thank you.

250
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
If you don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you...

251
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,500
like you're going to die.

252
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,940
And I know all the reasons for it.

253
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,240
I know every single reason for it.

254
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,500
Then you have the basic honk.

255
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,900
And the goose honk.

256
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,100
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

257
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,680
Where are Garland and Fletcher?

258
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,460
What?

259
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,360


260
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,040
I don't know just what you call it.

261
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,020
You're just able to pick it up in a hurry and...

262
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,140
Because every day becoming much more practical for my inspiration.

263
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,360
But I'm fascinated to know that.

264
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,080
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling

265
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,140
when you are stealing that extra ball.

266
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,500
Bob, what a relief.

267
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,200
How are you doing?

268
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,620
You're not working.

269
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,620


270
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,620


271
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,620


272
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,980
All day like the last night.

273
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,800
Is it Mark Lindulop?

274
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,660
Nothing.

275
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,020
He is not würdeo.

276
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,860
No Joseph Bosworth.

277
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,900
We position right now Tom-

278
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
Now you're a fascinating man with till you find out

279
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:20,500


280
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,720
when you sit down to play a movie.

281
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,400
Take a seat.

282
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,400


283
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,400


284
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,000
And this band is playing into my faculties

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,680
Too much gibtρά.

286
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,440
Now if you see your president entertain

287
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,060
Okay, you're going to hear your viewers

288
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,300
keep their Most, snap his face identify

289
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,480
He led the way, brothers.

290
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,980
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.

291
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,900
At first, a footloose, sore-footed shoe salesman.

292
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,980
One day he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design when he messed around

293
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,960
with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil that we call the divine immaculation.

294
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,380
But you know, his very name rings with magic.

295
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,360
Half human, half sprite, he saw the future and could transform himself into any form

296
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,680
merely by conjuring a big image in his mind.

297
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,100
The great Dobbs used his mystical powers to aid the forces of righteousness, honor and

298
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,420
virtue of Exotype and to shape the splendid visions of his noble king, Stan.

299
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,680
But when the tragic end of Dobbs Town drew near, many say that the heart-sick Dobbs sought

300
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,360
refuge with a tiny, tiny dog.

301
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,540
A tiddling poodle.

302
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:42,420
She gave him comfort and sheltered him in a tree to rest safely until needed by the

303
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,500
show once more.

304
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,260
What's going on here?

305
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,240
Yeah, why don't we?

306
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,560
It's later than you think.

307
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,320
Aye, the terrible, spittin' vengeance of Bob's mighty staff shall scour clean this planet

308
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
and the all-pervading radioactive pestanche of his own.

309
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,360


310
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,860
It's a supernatural love.

311
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,500
Wake up, open your heart, drop your pants, close your mind and bend over because he'll

312
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,640
be kicking and taking names, dear brothers and sisters.

313
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,800
He'll be struggling and gasping, his face will turn blue.

314
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,600
Then Bob will pitch over on the floor in the grip of a massive coronary thrombosis and we

315
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,060
will be there to see that event and to record it for you as it was at the beginning of time.

316
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,200
I saw a man with a pop and a grin, hauled in the new morning light.

317
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,740
Grinnin'

318
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,840
Come on, sing along now.

319
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,620
Grinin' like a man with a grin, all in the new morning light.

320
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:42,620


321
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:42,620


322
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,820
He made me uptight

323
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,820
I told him don't bother me anymore

324
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
But he kept on just the same

325
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,580
Till I was totally brainwashed

326
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,460
Bob is his name

327
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,160
Bob is my story

328
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,520
Bob is my song

329
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,740
Bob's my amphetamine

330
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,640
All the day long

331
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,200
I won't tear my poster of Bob's down

332
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,080
I'll feel no sadness or shame

333
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,480
Till I behold him in Dobbs town

334
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,420
Bob is his name

335
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,960
He has no lack of his patented slack

336
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,880
For those of his following fold

337
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,160
He is the friend of whoever will send

338
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,080
Greenbacks or gold

339
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,380
He's growing stronger and stronger

340
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,660
He'll get all the credit and blame

341
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll be a big boy no longer

342
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,740
Bob is his name

343
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,020
Yes, it is a sad affair

344
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,380
Bob's bigger than yours

345
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,980
Bob's bigger than yours

346
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,560
Bob's bigger than yours

347
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Isn't going to be relatively free

348
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,000
I will원이

349
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,720
This isn't going anywhere

350
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


351
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


352
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


353
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


354
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


355
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


356
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


358
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


359
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:26,720


360
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,400
My memory

361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,400


362
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,400


363
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,400


364
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,560
I was destined for old life

365
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,580
At this micili thonk

366
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:29,780
That's why I called Bob some good name

367
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:41,060
Bob and his friends kiss this youtube tenir it's lucidpptman ThomasLaughing thus I'd have 140 Ч retailer had Discussed that, we'llacak he was talking about Bob we were walking about in this movie with me outside the room as well so that's a hint I would notice

368
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,240
entertain them and provide content for their shows.

369
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,900
And they think it's free.

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,220
They think the electric environment is free.

371
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,760
Now, I make the point it is free,

372
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,660
but you've got to deal with the old industrial heritage,

373
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,960
the visual environment of money.

374
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,800
So I don't want to have idiots calling me up

375
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
and want to talk to me who don't even read the liner notes,

376
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,700
don't read my book.

377
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,120
They have no interest in my knowledge.

378
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,620
They just sort of are interested in the subgenius connection,

379
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,760
the staying connection.

380
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,120
And I'm more interested in talking about what I'm about

381
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,900
and what my Tetrad management is

382
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,300
and what I'm trying to explain to people.

383
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,940
And so if you're really interested, pay for it.

384
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,300
How do the people of Saturn feel about you being the head of the solar system?

385
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,540
Under popular government, the figures for a certain ground.

386
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,480
So when the ground is the solar secret government, 1945,

387
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,820
the front being the United Nations,

388
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,940
the popular government front is national government all over the world,

389
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,000
any national government.

390
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,220
This is the counterfeit Bob.

391
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,480
This is the counterfeit Bob in Canada, Bob Dean,

392
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,880
who said...

393
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,440
He says he's Bob.

394
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,760
He says that we based everything on him.

395
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,720
Don't say we never gave him a chance to speak.

396
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,180
With the solar stage at the front.

397
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,340
This important message.

398
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
In 1977, you have mass man as the secret government.

399
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,900
It's the ground.

400
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,640
And the figures for that are the solar popular government

401
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
and the universe as stage.

402
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,300
So by 77, Saturn is absorbed in the solar figure

403
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,300
because you have universe stage.

404
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,860
And then the fourth level, second coming, which is today,

405
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,860
but this was put together in 1870,

406
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,100
so today is every any point since 85.

407
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,340
You have the popular government is universal

408
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,300
and that includes the extraterrestrial contact.

409
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,660
And the front is the mythic stage.

410
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,860
The mythic stage is the hidden thing for the universal government.

411
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,980
So the universal government is absorbed by now.

412
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:38,360
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs divine immaculation.

413
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,800
All information was revealed.

414
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,740
The Dobbs in this blinding flash of knowledge,

415
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,640
which occurred as every true subgenius and every schoolboy knows

416
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,480
when he was working back in the 50s on an experimental television set of his own design.

417
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,180
It was 100% redundant.

418
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,460
He was messing around with the back of a TV set and it was suddenly immaculate.

419
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,320
Amplifier and multiplex the oral.

420
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,220
Don't give it away.

421
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,860
Don't tell him.

422
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,520
Let him figure it out for themselves.

423
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,940
Bob arrived at the mountaintop location.

424
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,740
He found the transmitter to be operating properly.

425
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,780
Normally, we would return a soldier to his stand.

426
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Oh, you're giving away church secrets.

427
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
This is not a thing.

428
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,540
Don't listen to him.

429
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,760
He's giving away church secrets.

430
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,180
Don't listen.

431
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,560
Don't listen.

432
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,100
Oh.

433
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,200
Does Alice figure any of this?

434
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,220
Alice?

435
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,800
Alice?

436
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,740
I don't know Alice.

437
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
The power of the visual transmitter associated with 22k VDC.

438
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,980
You're fading out.

439
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,000
You can't triangulate on your signal.

440
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,500
Speak into the rectifier.

441
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,140
I believe my danger existed.

442
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,700
Tell us who did it.

443
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:40,760


444
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,700
Unfortunately, the visual and aural power supplies are identical in appearance.

445
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,300
Any mistake...

446
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,200
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.

447
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,780
...high voltage contactor is stuck in the opposition.

448
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm out of contact.

449
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,760
He's out of control.

450
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,900
...high voltage.

451
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,980
He's got a mind of his own.

452
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,860
Bob was turned by...

453
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,780
...not being...

454
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,280
...on the...

455
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,640
...contact.

456
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,920
...contact.

457
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,840
...contact.

458
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,580
...contact.

459
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,260
...contact.

460
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,840
...contact.

461
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:05,840


462
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,280
...contact.

463
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:06,820


464
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:06,820


465
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:06,900


466
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,860
...contact.

467
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,080
...contact.

468
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,840
He swaped visual outputs from RadarACS.

469
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:30,840


470
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,460
sogenanbie were know 2009,

471
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


472
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


473
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


474
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


475
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,900
dub

476
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,840
rib benefits that

477
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:38,840


478
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,560
Cause I know I won't see you anymore

479
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,720
Don't pull your love out on me, baby

480
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,040
If you do, then I think that maybe

481
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,580
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years

482
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,120
Don't pull your love out on me, honey

483
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,560
Take my heart, my soul, my money

484
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,260
But don't leave me here drowning in my tears

485
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Heaven, I'll be good to you

486
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Without that brand new ring

487
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,760
Doesn't have to be love to you

488
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,840
Doesn't have to be anything

489
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,500
If I throw away my pride

490
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,580
And I got down on my knees

491
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,060
I wish you back, in fact, you were to bleed

492
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,140
There's so much I wanna do

493
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,560
I've got love enough for two

494
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,480
But I'll never choose a girl if I don't have you

495
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh, no you don't

496
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,180
Oh, no you don't, Rudy

497
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,400
Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friend

498
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,020
Oh, no you don't, Rudy

499
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,200
Whooping away in the background there

500
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,580
Joe Newman, our beloved friend Joe Newman

501
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,620
Whooping that out

502
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,260
On his Rudy Schwartz Project album

503
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,340
The Rudy Schwartz Project

504
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,280
Don't get charred, get puffy

505
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,800
And, uh

506
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm gonna switch that off

507
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah

508
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,980
Tell you what's been going on

509
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,920
Uh, since the last time I talked

510
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,020
I ran an edit of just some, well, radio shorts

511
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,960
You might call them radio shorts

512
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
By Radio Shorts, or Brain Rock West

513
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,280
Our new friends out there in San Francisco

514
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,180
Cutting some wild radio stuff

515
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,500
And then some more KPFA

516
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,980
Dr. Howl, howling away in the airwaves

517
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,940
From the edits by Phineas Narco

518
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,460
If you ever, uh, encounter

519
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,980
You'll notice that one in your, uh, subgenius catalog

520
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,260
Uh, reference to that type

521
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,360
A little slip there of Bob Dean

522
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,160
The counterfeit Bob, the thief

523
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,500
In, uh, Toronto

524
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,080
Who's decided that he really invented

525
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,460
The church of the subgenius

526
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,900
And, uh, whoa, whoa

527
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,940
Uh, just, uh, whatever you do

528
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,260
Don't purchase Bob's media ecology

529
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,780
And, uh, don't, don't purchase it

530
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,320
Thinking you're getting any kind of real subgenius

531
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,440
It is, uh, you know, it's just

532
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,720
A pretty sickening situation there

533
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,940
But, um, and what we're hearing in the background right now

534
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,980
And what I think I'm gonna let carry us over to, uh

535
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,300
Side two of show

536
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
So I can get to the basic Bobby Hayton rant here

537
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,040
This is Joe Newman in the background

538
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,060
On Zug's Riffs album

539
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,800
Actually, it's the Zug's band

540
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, on a new Zug's Riffs album

541
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,460
Which we'll be playing a lot of

542
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,640
It's called Villagers

543
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,020
This is an instrumental song called Villagers

544
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,260
Yes, the title song

545
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,340
I'm gonna shut up and just

546
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,020
Let them go

547
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,380
I'm gonna shut up and just watch

548
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,380


549
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,380


550
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,860
Keep you lookoutin'

551
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,760
Ain't a vacun'

552
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,040
A mask on the road

553
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,240
Checkin' back to the Nothing but tegen'

554
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,780
And now I'm goin' in

555
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,520
Ain't that damn show

556
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,080
I'm a beegin'

557
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
With only a chance of success

558
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,420
And I'm winnin' the game

559
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,440
I am quite proud to be a fan of que탁

560
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,360
I've got a fire extinguisher!

561
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,600
...with someone in the studio wondering why the transmitter was off the air.

562
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,460
Paramedics arrived by helicopter only twenty-five minutes later.

563
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,320
So they're basically those that get into the vehicle.

564
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,760
Yes, and all the bibble babble we like to burble at the center of the universe.

565
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,000
So shines a good deal in a movie world.

566
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,700
He don't ever change.

567
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,100
He's Bob.

568
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,640
He always stays the same.

569
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,120
He's got the lightning and the thunder.

570
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,560
And he's got the neutron bomb.

571
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,240
Bob is your sister and your brother.

572
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,360
Bob's your dad and mom.

573
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,440
Bob.

574
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,600
He's Bob.

575
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,560
Bob don't ever change.

576
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,700
He's Bob.

577
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,060
Always will be Bob.

578
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,580
Bob.

579
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,100
Bob.

580
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
Bob.

581
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,120
It's obvious, of course, the world in general is an idiot's delight.

582
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,080
A contrived mediocrity designed to keep morons occupied.

583
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,580
Just look at the notorious conspiracy media.

584
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,100
Just look at the notorious conspiracy media.

585
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,100


586
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,700
Not the decoy reputable media.

587
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,940
That's just a distraction.

588
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,560
Window dressing to make things look good.

589
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,520
I mean the stuff people really read and really believe whether they admit it or not.

590
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,040
Look at the tabloids.

591
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,480
The true crime magazines.

592
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
The TV murder shows.

593
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,780
The two-inch thick metallic embossed covered hack sci-fi novels and romances.

594
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,180
Lame movie thrillers.

595
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,880
Manufactured music.

596
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
Music personalities.

597
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,920
It's bread and circuses with politicians as the clowns.

598
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,800
Except the more fun you want to have, the more you have to pay.

599
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,560
Don't act like you haven't thought about how bad all that stuff sucks.

600
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,160
You talk about it all the time.

601
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,160
The question is, what are you going to do about it?

602
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,200
They, the conspiracy, want you to buy all their crap, work hard all day at a mindless slave task,

603
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,760
to make, to pay for more machines to play their indoctrination programs on.

604
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,560
To fill your home with pseudo collectibles in a limited number edition of a godzillion.

605
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,200
You know all that.

606
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,600
We've told you and told you all that.

607
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,380
And if you don't believe it by now, there's no hope for you at all.

608
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:28,640
And you might as well climb back over the fence and roll in the mud with the rest of the slavish porkers.

609
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,060
Right?

610
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,680
So you say to yourself, okay.

611
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,180
I know what the conspiracy is.

612
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,060
I know what the conspiracy wants from me.

613
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
I know how they work and what they do.

614
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,300
And I'm not buying it.

615
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,340
By gabbs, I'm not going to do what they tell me.

616
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:47,120
I'm throwing away my TV, smashing my porcelain thimble collection, frisbeeing my CDs off lover's leap,

617
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,460
and joining the radical anti-government party to learn how to make bombs.

618
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,820
I'm shaving my head and burning my house down.

619
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,840
And the more they tell me not to, the more I'll laugh in their faces and echo the noble sentiments of whoever it was that said,

620
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
free at last, free at last, thank blob almighty, I'm free at last.

621
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,060
Right?

622
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,640
Sucker.

623
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,760
You think they didn't plan for that?

624
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,320
You think they'll be surprised, huddling around their long mahogany table,

625
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,900
appalled that one tenth of one percent of the population has quote, caught on, unquote,

626
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,640
and won't go up the slaughterhouse ramp like good little lambies?

627
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,740
Well, hardy har har.

628
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,900
Listen, they know they can't dupe everyone with the same bird brain programming system.

629
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,220
They know there are going to be a few who are just sharp enough to shake themselves awake

630
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,220
and look around to see the green pastures and still waters they were lying down by

631
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:54,600
are actually a clanking conveyor belt carrying them relentlessly toward the whirling blaze.

632
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,560
They had that worked out a long time ago.

633
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
They love it when the world is a mess.

634
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,940
The ones who see the horror of the conspiracy system go public with their ghastly revelations

635
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,500
or join radical anarchist communes or otherwise render themselves entirely unbelievable.

636
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:21,480
Who do you think invented hippies, punk rock, anarchism, youth gangs, graffiti art, rock and roll,

637
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,740
hallucinogenic drugs, the new age movement, Christianity, cult films, alternative what have you?

638
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,740
Sure, it was some lone radical disillusioned soul at first, for about six months.

639
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:43,000
But by the time we heard about it, it was already a prepackaged official conspiracy product.

640
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Oh, but the Church of the Subgenius is different, right?

641
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,220
It's neither a conspiracy mediocrity brainwashing program nor a dead-end escapee trap.

642
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,840
Bob isn't just a cheap product or just a mind-numbing neurotic whip

643
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,740
or a gaily painted prison cell of one sort or another to confine drooling vidiots or raving reactionaries.

644
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,660
Right? Right? Right? Right?

645
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,800
Huh! Wrong again.

646
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Look, why don't you just give up trying to think it all, little Miz and Mr. Einstein Jr. and pay attention.

647
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,720
The con has got all the bases gone.

648
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,420
It's all covered. It owns the ball and the ballpark.

649
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:43,220
Everything you can or will think or decide, it has already got classified by numerical designation on big spinning spools of half-inch magnetic tape.

650
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:52,260
You sitting here listening to this right now, thinking what you're thinking, wearing those clothes in that environment,

651
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,880
tasting that particular taste in your mouth,

652
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,260
and hearing that particular tinny whine in your ear, the one you don't always notice but which is always there,

653
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,080
they got a number for it.

654
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,480
Believe me, they got it all.

655
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,960
Figured, dissected, classified, and stuck in little boxes.

656
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,360
So what do I do, you may ask?

657
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,080
You can't win. You can't outsmart them.

658
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,620
You can't think or do anything that they haven't already decided you'll probably think or do.

659
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,800
You can't find a chink in their armor.

660
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
Not even Bob!

661
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,440
Because he is just another part of it all.

662
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,500
So it's time to pack it in.

663
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:42,520
Just give up and shoot yourself in the head like you've been threatening to do just to get attention and sympathy.

664
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,340
But this time you really will do it.

665
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,420
And that too is just what they want you to do.

666
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,260
There really is no way out.

667
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,240
All that smash the conspiracy stuff is fun and amusing.

668
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:03,480
But putting your head under the machine's enormous clattering treads isn't going to slow it one tiny bit.

669
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,420
It's utterly, utterly hopeless.

670
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,060
Just stop fighting it.

671
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,640
Give up.

672
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,960
You're only making things harder for everyone.

673
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,900
All that kicking and screaming is only disturbing the peaceful slumbers of the rest of us.

674
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,360
Oh, I'm not saying you should simply get in line and walk under the hammer.

675
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,800
But if you can't do anything else, you might as well try to see something positive about it.

676
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,580
Sure, the conspiracy program is cruel and demeaning.

677
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,580
The cage is cramped and ugly and smells bad.

678
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,760
But you can't get out.

679
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:49,860
And if you did get out, you'd just want right back in again because the thing that is making the situation intolerable isn't in the situation.

680
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,700
It's in your head.

681
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:01,480
The scariest part of the conspiracy's lulling lies is that they're all true.

682
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,680
Oh, not the ones about the products and how bad you need them.

683
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,240
I mean the ones about how life can be beautiful.

684
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,280
It's easier to go with the flow.

685
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,900
Things are better than they've ever been.

686
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,900
They know how true those are.

687
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,840
So they do anything they can to make those true truths look stupid.

688
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Stupid and childish.

689
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,620
They make Don't Worry, Be Happy into an insulting song.

690
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,420
Ugly t-shirts, plastic hats, moronic coffee mugs.

691
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,480
So when somebody says it to you, it makes you want to smash them in the face.

692
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,280
But you can't.

693
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,300
So you go buy a three dollar shot of bar of gin instead.

694
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,900
And worry miserably.

695
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,780
Oh, they make you want to kill Have a Nice Day.

696
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,820
And then sell you the t-shirt with a shot and bleeding lines.

697
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,120
With a smiley face on it.

698
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,760
They'll make you hate, love, and love hate.

699
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,240
And mock sincerity and honesty.

700
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,520
And sneer at genuine emotion.

701
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,780
Then they sell you a two hundred dollar leather jacket.

702
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,200
So you can prove you aren't a conspiracy zombie.

703
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,540
Like all those poor schmucks who don't have skulls on their t-shirts.

704
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,600
Or if you can't identify with either extreme of the haircut spectrum.

705
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,120
If they can't get you any other way.

706
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,820
If you're just a little bit of a wimp.

707
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,600
If you're just a little too smart to be dumb.

708
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,680
And a little too dumb to be smart.

709
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,780
And you're just about to fall through the cracks.

710
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,060
Along comes Bob.

711
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:39,160
And then you read all about those real weirdos who, even if they do wear uniforms and spout mottos,

712
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:47,000
wear intentionally self-mocking uniforms and spout irrelevant, confusing, and meaningless mottos.

713
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,500
Ma'am.

714
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,500
At last, you can think to yourself.

715
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,240
Or tell your uncomprehending friend.

716
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:58,940
At last, there's a tiny spot in this big cold world where I can feel at home.

717
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:06,880
At last, I've found a philosophy that agrees to a certain degree with the one I never really knew I had.

718
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,560
At last, I can just be honest with myself and be who I really am publicly and unafraid.

719
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,480
So you send lots of people to the bathroom.

720
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:17,480


721
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,260
And you give lots of money to Bob.

722
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,760
And buy t-shirts and buttons and tapes.

723
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,240
And put on a devival.

724
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,860
Have a radio show.

725
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,080
Get a boy or girlfriend at last.

726
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,760
Have the time of your life.

727
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,800
And never feel it when the hammer finally does come down on your head.

728
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,260

787
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,940
Church of the new faith.

788
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,820
That's our first song we have ever heard from church in the

789
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,260
New Faith.

790
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,320
Oh, Susie.

791
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,320
Let's take the time to talk a little bit about Connie.

792
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,160
Let's do, Susie.

793
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,680
Connie Dobbs is kind of a new personage to the church.

794
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,480
She is Bob Dobbs' first and primary wife.

795
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,800
And since I found Connie, things are so different for me now.

796
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,160
I mean, Connie is the most uber of uber women.

797
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,840
She is truly the higher price spread.

798
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,440
You know, Connie doesn't need sex.

799
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,120
Sex needs Connie.

800
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,540
But it took Connie to let me know that I had slack.

801
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,320
One day, I found Connie in my underwear drawer,

802
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,580
right under one of my black bustiers in the midst of star dust and cheap cologne.

803
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,220
And she said,

804
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,760
Flooz, Flooz, you need slack bad.

805
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,500
And she taught me how to take my slack and beat it against the wall

806
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,820
until the musk flowed to wring out every last precious drop of blessed slack.

807
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,880
And, uh, things like which marital aids are truly top rack dishwasher safe.

808
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,880
And, uh, the honesty is the best policy, but insanity is a better defense.

809
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,920
I was sold, and so was my soul.

810
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,560
I gladly signed Connie's contract in my own blood, and I've never looked back.

811
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,580
The benefits were immediate.

812
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,400
I went on Connie's special slim-fast ice cream fish stick diet, dropped 35 pounds.

813
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,660
And when my replacement driver's license came up,

814
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,700
I was like, oh, my God.

815
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:56,820
I'm so sorry.

816
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


817
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


818
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


819
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


820
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


821
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


822
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


823
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


824
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


825
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


826
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


827
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


828
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


829
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,780
But it's stamped under 21 on it and big red letters.

830
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,680
And I'm 36.

831
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,280
So if that isn't proof of an effective religious spiritual leader,

832
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,040
I don't know what is.

833
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,000
But, yeah, to get a perception of Connie,

834
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,880
I guess it would be hard for the XY people,

835
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,400
the ones with the unfortunately mutated chromosome,

836
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,960
being an XX myself.

837
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,420
Or, actually, I'm more closer to XXX.

838
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:33,700
I think I'll let a girl group called the Sterills from California say it for me.

839
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,660
I love the rag.

840
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,400
Get me a Kotex.

841
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,400
How about a pamperin'?

842
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,720
I hate men.

843
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,660
, I'm on the rag.

844
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,600
I'm on the rag.

845
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,700
I'm on the rag.

846
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm swollen like a pig.

847
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,880
Get me a pamperin'.

848
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,280
My boobs hurt.

849
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,740
I'm on the rag.

850
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,800
My boobs hurt.

851
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,740
I'm on the rag.

852
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,820
Get me a Ko-Tex.

853
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,920
I'm on the rag.

854
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,360
I hate you.

855
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,820
I hate me.

856
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,780
I'm on the rag.

857
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,400
I'm on the rag.

858
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,840
I'm on the rag.

859
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,680
Get me a Ko-Tex.

860
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,240
I'm on the rag.

861
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,220
I hate you.

862
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,680
I hate me.

863
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm on the rag.

864
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,340
I'm on the rag.

865
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,220
I hate men.

866
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,060
Don't even think of it tonight.

867
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,800
Of course I'd be wearing white.

868
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,460
I was ragged.

869
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,820
I was ragged.

870
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,120

876

I hate me.

881
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,540
I was ragged.

882
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,820
I was ragged.

883
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,380
I was ragged.

884
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,260
Get me a pepperon.

885
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,580

I was ragged.

889
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,060
I was ragged.

890
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,960
Get me a coattail.

891
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,780
I was ragged.

892
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,120
I left the Multérique.

893
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,140
I was ragged.

894
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,140


895
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,900
I was ragged.

896
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,700
The look was bridges.

897
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,960
Oh no.

898
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,700
Bigly.

899
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:30,700


900
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:30,700


901
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,560
No.

902
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,040
No.

903
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,920
No matter what, I don't.

904
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,580
I just create Chagos.

905
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:35,580


906
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:35,780
And her.

907
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,440
And voicing.

908
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:37,940
No.

909
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,260
No.

910
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:41,280
She was like her other best friend.

911
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,300
While I didn't know much about彭רос

912
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,200
I was very afraid.

913
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,940
And then I needed me to change the course.

914
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,040
And that's what got into me.

915
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm in a way.

916
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,800
for uh we'd come up from the San Diego

917
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,820
comic convention to hang out

918
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,960
and on Hollywood freeway

919
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,120
coming into town

920
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,780
a station that was kind of a pirate

921
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,020
station uh 91X

922
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,120
out of Baja California

923
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,880
Mexico played

924
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,700
that and somehow I

925
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,200
learned the words real fast

926
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,100
I was driving the rental car and my head sticking out the window

927
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,920
and intoning those sacred

928
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,740
words but I'm sure

929
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,380
Connie feels the same way

930
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,560
and looking around

931
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,440
the vast

932
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,980
amount of media

933
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,960
influences that we have here in the church

934
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,740
you can find all sorts of evidence

935
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,480
of Connie

936
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,780
one of my favorite

937
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,540
Connie incarnations is

938
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,860
Taurus Satana and Faster Pussycat

939
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,460
Kill Kill the Immortal

940
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,120
Mortal

941
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,500
I'm wearing a Freudian slip too

942
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,920
the Immortal Russ Meyer

943
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,640
movie from 1966

944
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,220
and

945
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,560
the Boss Tweeds

946
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,040
did the theme song

947
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,700
you may uh the cramps

948
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,620
not the uh

949
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,240
not the cramps that the

950
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,640
Stirls have but

951
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,920
the group the cramps you may remember uh

952
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,120
they did a cover of it

953
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,860
so let's hear the theme from Faster Pussycat

954
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,640
Kill Kill by the Boss

955
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,600
Say bow-tow

956
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,860
Say down-tow

957
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,100
oh

958
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh Tuesday, oh what a day

959
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,860
Hey yo!

960
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,020
Niro!

961
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,880
ahhhhhhhhh

962
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,020
I just had to let it go

963
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,360
Little nation of Serbia

964
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,960
belt

965
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,660
wear hats

966
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,080
and for several weeks

967
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,320
There after there was a long

968
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,200
period of time when it

969
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,140
It seemed, although it was not so, it seemed as though...

970
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,440
Customs became a friend of these particular people.

971
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,320
If it was harmful, I'd be the first one to admit it and tell you that,

972
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,640
but I don't see anything wrong.

973
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,680
...

974
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,840
0034, that it would not work and would not...

975
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,600
This stuff can't be true.

976
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,380
Well, it's going to be hard because a lot of these programs have been saved

977
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,840
or have been modified.

978
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,520
...

979
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
He's Bob.

980
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,020
Bob don't ever change.

981
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,100
He's Bob.

982
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,380
Always will be Bob.

983
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,360
Bob had a woman named Connie.

984
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,080
She was the best he found.

985
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,420
You'd think when she'd stand in the doorway,

986
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,480
the sun was on the ground.

987
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,340
He's Bob.

988
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,320
Bob don't ever change.

989
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,500
He's Bob.

990
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,980
Always will be Bob.

991
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,940
This has been a test.

992
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,460
If Bob had actually died,

993
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,580
you would have heard this sound.

994
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,780
Bob is dead.

995
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,540
Bob is dead.

996
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,300
Bob is dead.

997
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,540
If Bob dies,

998
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,580
we will alert you.

999
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,840
If Bob has been shot,

1000
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,220
we will alert you.

1001
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,220


1002
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,860
we will alert you.

1003
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,560
Bob is dead.

1004
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,440
If Bob has been shot,

1005
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:22,440


1006
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:22,520
Bob is dead.

1007
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:22,520


1008
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:22,520


1009
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:22,520


1010
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,560
That guy scared me.

1011
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,220
I'd like to put out a request for the caller that thinks that

1012
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,120
Philo is the greatest showperson that's ever been on the show.

1013
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,600
Well, perhaps that caller is attending the contact list.

1014
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,640
Let's find out here.

1015
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,940
I don't want to talk to that guy.

1016
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,000
I think he moved.

1017
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,040
Hello, you're on the air.

1018
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,200
Yes, I've been looking, looking, looking for Simon.

1019
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Well, what about...

1020
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,560
Dr. Philodrumon, do you have a question for him?

1021
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,620
Oh, no, I didn't.

1022
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,080
All right, ditch this loser.

1023
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,400
There's a band hanging from the side of their face.

1024
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,780
Well, so much for the callers at 848-4425.

1025
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,120
Now one wildly insulted person is jumping up and down in front of the station with a shotgun,

1026
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,300
ready to off the famous subgenius radio personality.

1027
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,400
They'll never get me.

1028
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,940
You'll never get me.

1029
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,400
You'll have to try the show out of your cold pink hands.

1030
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,960
See Sinbad have his prostate examined.

1031
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,200
See men poke sticks at monsters.

1032
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,440
See them battle the million skeletons.

1033
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,700
All old, all dead before.

1034
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,080
And don't miss appalling co-hit, The Big Monster.

1035
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,220
Nothing could stop it except dynamite.

1036
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,020
And with our new virtual unreality imaging system, you too can have sex with Bart Simpson.

1037
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,320
Play some Hyperfleet's records. I want to hear Jane or Hyperfleet's.

1038
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,780
I want to hear the world of fail. I want to hear them.

1039
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,440
I'm looking for me.

1040
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,380
I love you.

1041
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:43,780
I want to eat dick.

1042
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,520
I want to eat dick.

1043
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,300
I want to eat dick.

1044
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:45,920
I want to eat dick.

1045
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,660
I was talking to John Holmes the other day, and I said, is that your penis or a post-old

1046
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:49,960
digger?

1047
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:50,940
But seriously, no.

1048
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,060
You know when they...

1049
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,600
That was dedicated to Doug Smith on his show.

1050
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,720
Poor Willa Dobbs got nailed for saying that very thing.

1051
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,980
Yeah, you know, I was talking...

1052
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,220
Well, I don't know how to top that except by saying you're listening to radio station

1053
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,780
KNON 89.3, Dallas-Fort Worth, the voice of the people.

1054
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,880
And it's time for Celtic Crossroads.

1055
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,200
We've got a couple of announcements to do, or one or two.

1056
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,380
Well, I've already done the legalized...

1057
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,680
Let's do the community news, and we'll be back.
