1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,580
We're in a war zone, Dave.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,400
Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a deadly crossfire.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,440
The police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate heroic attempts.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,780
It's completely out of control now.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,160
And meekness and righteousness.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,260
And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,220
Huh.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
I guess with a sword in your right hand, you could probably learn a lot of terrible things.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,680
Whoa, verse 5.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,880
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,780
Huh.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,620
Solomon doesn't seem really like too nice of a guy.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,260
That is, if you're his enemy.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:55,920
Steve, we can see the flag that was raised yesterday with the Star of David

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,660
and the Star of David.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:56,660


17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,160
The serpent on a blue field still waving in the background.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,480
Has that been raised continuously?

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,140
That you, that you, that ye.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,900
It's hard to separate everything.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,180
Everything relates to each other.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,620
For every action, there's a reaction.

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,940
We got to tell them that they got to come out of them dog tracks.

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,120
We got to preach, get that dog track.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,420
A lot of people say nothing wrong with the dog track.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,720
When you're in that dog track.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,660
You are going to hear some orders over which you will have no control.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,260
Bob?

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,620
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,080
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,040
Bob?

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,940
That's your key phrase.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,940
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,140
And what exactly does this do for them?

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,860
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and it prepares their mind

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,480
for the slate.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,260
It's like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,100
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

39
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:12,740
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Hour of sweat.

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,860
It's not a pleasant job, but someone's got to do it.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,980
But anyway, thy throne, oh God, is for, huh?

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,620
Wait a minute.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Thy throne, oh God, is for ever and ever.

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,520
Now, wait a minute.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Is David saying that Solomon is God?

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
No, he's probably just saying that God is God.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,600
Huh.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,900
Well, why would a prophecy about Solomon have to do with God's throne?

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,540
Thy throne, oh God, is for ever and ever.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,180
The scepter of thy kingdom is right scepter.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,860
Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness.

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,400
Therefore, God, thy...

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,920
Therefore, God, thy God?

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,080
What could this possibly mean?

57
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,340
Look, you can't figure out everything.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,940
You can't put everything into a perfect box and be perfect and everything.

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,620
I took my clothes off and laid on the floor.

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,900
No, the coffee table.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,720
Was that with sugar or with cream?

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,720
No.

63
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,880
I wish I could think up something very witty and funny that you would just have to listen to like ten times and just laugh.

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,920
But I can't think of anything, so.

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,420
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,820
Think of something on your own.

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,340
You do that.

68
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,980
You're funny.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm not.

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
Tell that prostitute that she don't quit turning tricks.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
She only way to hell.

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
I expect the tape recorder to start laughing with that one.

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,380
Yeah.

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,860
Yeah.

75
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,760
Let me put it on pause here.

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,940
Every hell's ever heard of...

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,100
My hair caught on fire.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,260
Our car caught on fire.

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,460
And my TV set caught on fire.

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,780
And our couch caught on fire.

81
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,940
An electric current.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,600
This is very strange.

83
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,200
Or is it?

84
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,780
Well, let's look at it again a little closer.

85
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,460
At home.

86
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,120
At home.

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,380


88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,560
At home.

89
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:18,940


90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
At home.

91
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,940
At home.

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,520
At home.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Listen up, Reverend Isaac Stagg.

94
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,620
We have you surrounded.

95
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,640
Please release the children.

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,580
We're your friends.

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,860
If you come out, we promise not to prosecute.

98
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,300
Really.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,460
We want to be your friends.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Dad, come on. Just let us get out of here.

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,460
This is boring. It's stupid.

102
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
We don't want to carry on like this.

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
Let's just go. Give it up.

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,740
Well, uh...

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,880
I, Reverend Ivan Stagg,

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,100
promise upon the broadcast of this 58 minutes of slack

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,380
that, uh, to, well,

108
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,580
release the hostages and the children,

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,860
uh, to come out peacefully with the people,

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
all the people, immediately.

111
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,560
We will, uh, give up all three of our nuclear weapons

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,480
and the canisters of BZ gas

113
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,040
and, uh, leave the radio station.

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,920
Uh, uh...

115
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,040
Once the people have heard my message

116
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,280
and heeded Bob's word,

117
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,660
I promise the preachers never miss.

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,060
Uh-huh.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,820
Ahh.

120
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,780
Oh...

121
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,100
Mmm, mmm.

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
Uh-huh.

123
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,540
Mmm-hmmm.

124
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,540


125
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,540


126
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,540


127
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,360
Uh-huh, I would sang right now.

128
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:44,900
Uh-huh, so,Ã¤nger over here.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:56,660
This is in such a came-on place,

130
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,480
right now rather than be stuck here in this standoff clutching all these arterial wounds.

131
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,480
But that's okay. I'm only concerned about the lives of the branch Bob Dobzians here

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,840
and the lives of all subgeniuses in this world. This world without slack. If the Federal Bureau

133
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,480
of Demonology and Frappy and Cults would have just served as a warrant, I'm sure we could

134
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,420
have come along peacefully. All we were trying to do was summon the saucers and make a little

135
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,160
bit of money and some harmless target practice and ritual bloodletting here, but that's our

136
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,860
rights as religious Americans. Huh. But, you know, without Bob, without that mighty sales

137
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:52,300
guru, we have no slack. Why? Well, because. Just because. Bob sold it, we smoked it, and

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,460
that's it.

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:01,820
It's settled. Huh. The standard of Dob's righteousness is slack, and that's our divine

140
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:09,120
excuse. We don't need forgiveness. Just that excuse, which Wotan gave to Bob. This is his

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,720
sacred stupidity. And now we're waiting for God's video camera to get it set up before

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,240
we continue. So, for now, you're going to have to listen to this religious radio

143
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,400
parable by Brain Rot Theater. But we will come out with the children as soon as you

144
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
have heard all of these tapes.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:51,960
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Someday I wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are.

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,680
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Someday I wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are.

147
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Tonight on Brain Rot Radio Theater, we're pleased to have a very special guest. A man who needs no introduction, so I won't tell you who he is.

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,880
You just have to guess. But here's a hint. Tonight's episode is called When Bobs Collide.

149
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,360
Two taut and twisted tales to tease and titillate concerning Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

150
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,420
Tonight's first offering is called The Wizard of Bobbs. It starts off in a raging storm of controversy.

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,160
Where are you going? I've been speeding. You know you shouldn't go out tonight. There's supposed to be super bad weather brewing.

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,920
Well, let it brew. Neither wind, nor sleet, nor rain, nor snow, nor face-riping bats.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm going to have to go to the radio station to do the hour of slack. I must continue to bring the messages of Bob Dobbs, no matter what the cost to my physical well-being.

154
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,580
Spoken like a true subgenius. Okay, lover, it's your funeral.

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,520
Oh, Bob.

156
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,640
Oh.

157
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,220
So brave, Ivan. Brave the old man.

158
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,560
He had the elements to deliver his message of slack and the cutting, though, to the eager populace's ears.

159
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:36,200
He was barely able to get to the studio through the gale force winds in his cheesy car, Cheval Vito.

160
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,720
But he did. While the winds worked themselves up to a fever pitch, Ivan began working himself up to a fevered pitch.

161
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,680
My fellow time travelers, thank you for tuning in to the hour of slack.

162
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,540
I'm Ivan Stang.

163
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,660
And so am I.

164
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,020
Tonight's message is one of hope and despair.

165
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,580
One of abstruseness and enlightenment.

166
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,280
For you see, there is an albatross looming large over the northern horizon.

167
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,320
Over Lake Irresponsible in the land of Canada.

168
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,100
Best spam I ever ate.

169
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,000
An albatross? No.

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,520
It's known as plagiarism.

171
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:30,240
Yes, it's rearing its ugly head job and setting its sights on the church of the subgenius.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,640
Your church, my friends, our faithless, faithful legions.

173
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:44,920
Do not be misled or confused by claims or counterclaims by these false net prophets calling themselves the purveyor of Bob.

174
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
The Canucks are sneaky.

175
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
The Canucks are greedy.

176
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,220
The Canucks are rippling.

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,820
They're ripping us off.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,400
The Canucks have high-powered lawyers.

179
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,240
And I don't.

180
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,000
Why would they bother to rip us off, you ask?

181
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,220
Because.

182
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,260
Because they see what the power of Bob can do.

183
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,220
What it has done and what it will do.

184
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:18,460
How it can transform mediocre existence into a metaphysical jitterbug.

185
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,800
They have seen the crippled begin to hear again.

186
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,220
They have seen the crippled begin to hear again.

187
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,700
They have seen the blind to walk and the deaf to throw away their canes.

188
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,020
And so they mock us by their plagiarism.

189
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,460
Do they say imitation is the best form of flattery?

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,200
Don't believe it, my friends.

191
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,040
Imitation is the best form of a lawsuit.

192
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,600
So what is this bastard aberration called, you ask?

193
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,540
He's called Bob Beans.

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,060
Not Bob Dobbs.

195
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,280
Do not get blown away by the rhetoric.

196
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Do not get blown away by the fancy logo.

197
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,400
Do not get blown away.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,980
What's going on?

199
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,280
Oh my God.

200
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
The hurricane is outside the window.

201
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,300
Oh my dog, it's uprooting the studio.

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm airborne.

203
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,260
I'm getting blown away.

204
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,700
Oh.

205
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,260
At this.

206
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,660
Yes, the mighty tempest picked up that best little station in Texas

207
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,960
and hurled it skyward with its lone passenger inside.

208
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,860
For months it carried ...

209
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,940
No, no, mimic that, about an hour.

210
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,120
For about an hour it carried the station and passenger

211
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,280
until finally it came to land in a strange land.

212
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,680
One!

213
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,780
Two!

214
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,700
Oh, what the hell?

215
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
Oh, man, oh, man, a chevitz.

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,560
This don't look like Dallas anymore, in toto.

217
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,700
Jumping baby Jesus.

218
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,280
Look at that, will you?

219
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,360
My radio studio landed smack dab on somebody.

220
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,120
Just a head sticking out.

221
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,080
Wow, it looks like a deformed Bob Dobbs clone with a pipe in its mouth.

222
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
You can all come out now, lunchkins.

223
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,580
This nice man has just killed the wicked network executive of the South by placing KNON on him.

224
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Who are you? Where am I?

225
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,280
I am Giselda, the good network executive of the West.

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,580
You and your radio station have somehow landed in the land of Bob's.

227
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:44,700
Bob's.

228
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,060
Right on top of the wicked network executive of the South.

229
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,580
All you lunchkins can come out now.

230
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,760
Wow.

231
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
We're rich kids, but it's just bad.

232
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,020
It's okay.

233
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,260
Bob's?

234
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,180
Look, this is a great premise, but I've got to get back to Dallas.

235
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,620
I've got lawsuits pending.

236
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:39,060
I cannot help you find this place you call Dallas, but I might know someone who maybe could get you some slack and help you.

237
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,880
Well, that's Grook and Fate.

238
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,160
Who is he and where can I find him?

239
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,480
The person.

240
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,700
Actually, he's not a person, but a...

241
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,660
surreal entity is the Wizard of Bob's.

242
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,160
And he's in the Animal World City.

243
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,140
Fair in the ruck as that.

244
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,900
How do I get there?

245
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,080
Tell him how to get there, lunchkins.

246
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
The yellow spit toad.

247
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,800
The yellow spit toad.

248
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,200
The yellow spit toad.

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,460
The yellow spit toad.

250
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,000
The yellow spit toad.

251
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,300
The yellow spit toad.

252
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,500
The yellow spit toad.

253
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,580
That's the best you guys could come up with?

254
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,780
Geez, that blows.

255
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,060
That blows.

256
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,720
That blows.

257
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,880
That blows.

258
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Like the good character actor that he is, he followed the script and followed the yellow spit toad until he came upon a huge cornfield.

259
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,500
My, my, look at that big cornfield.

260
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,300
That must be where Brain Rot gets all their material.

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,060
Jumping mother of Pearl Bailey.

262
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,680
What an ugly looking black scarecrow.

263
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,200
What an ugly looking black scarecrow.

264
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,960
I ain't no scarecrow.

265
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,840
I ain't no scarecrow.

266
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,420
It talks.

267
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,200
What are you?

268
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,340
Sure I talk.

269
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,700
I can sing and swallow and dance and all the things you humans do.

270
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,500
I can sing and swallow and dance and all the things you humans do.

271
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,860
My name is Scabby Daze.

272
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,700
Could you help me get my brain back inside my head?

273
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:05,840


274
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,740
It oozed out again.

275
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,340
I had a frontal lobotomy.

276
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,060
It was in a bottle in front of me.

277
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I got a spare brain on you.

278
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,580
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,260
I'm fresh out of brains.

280
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,000
An esophagus I could help you with.

281
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,540
I've got an extra set of several organs.

282
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,880
Say, why don't you come with me?

283
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,820
I'm off to see the Wizard of Bob's in Enema World City to cut me some slack.

284
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
I bet he could help you to get a brain.

285
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,900
Please take me with you.

286
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,020
Please, please, please.

287
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,120
Where are we going again? Italy?

288
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,600
Take me with you.

289
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,440
Sure, sure, sure.

290
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,160
No problem.

291
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,640
Something's got to move this plot along.

292
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,860
Come on with me and follow the yellow spit toad.

293
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Ribbit.

294
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,320
I've to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Bob's.

295
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,760
Because, because, because, because, because, because of the surreal things he does.

296
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,420
And so Scabby Daze and Ivan Stang went along the road.

297
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,040
In their merry way.

298
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,300
Following the yellow spit toad wherever he jumped.

299
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,960
By chance, they happened upon another strange character in the Hollyweeds.

300
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,220
Say, look at that.

301
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,860
Look, it looks like an Indian.

302
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,080
And he feels frozen in some kind of yogi position.

303
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
Bob, Bob, you're right.

304
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,880
What's this?

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,380
A chanting book by his side.

306
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,440
The game of chants.

307
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,180
Let's take a chance and chant.

308
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,420
Let's do it.

309
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,200
And go, da, di, di, di, da, da, di, di, di, da, di, di, da, di, da, di, da, di, di, da, di, di, da, di, da, di, da, di, da, di, da, di, da.

310
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,520
Ugly.

311
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,420
Thanks, strangers.

312
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,080
Thanks for that game of chants.

313
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,200
Oh, my God.

314
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,560
It helps spirit get back in body.

315
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,780
Good thing, too.

316
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,320
That damn spirit was running my credit cards up again.

317
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,140
What's your name, oh faker?

318
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
And why were you frozen?

319
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,660
I've never seen him.

320
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,380
I'm a psychopath finder.

321
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,940
Indian medicine ball man of great stature.

322
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,000
Me searching for mantra with different yoga positions and chants.

323
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,680
One chant so bad, spirit leave body.

324
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,800
Take soul.

325
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
Now me have no soul.

326
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,260
Me like straight white man.

327
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
I wear wingtips.

328
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,600
I listen to Lawrence Wilk.

329
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,700
I can't jump.

330
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,480
I can't dance.

331
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,820
I lost my soul.

332
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,880
There, there, there.

333
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,240
So you lost your soul, huh?

334
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,140
Well, you know, this sounds like another job for the Wizard of Bob's.

335
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,600
Why don't you come with us to the Emerald World City?

336
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm sure he'll cut you some slack.

337
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,320
Ugly?

338
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,360
Me come.

339
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,240
Wait.

340
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,720
Me better put ear to ground, listen for sign.

341
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Uh-oh.

342
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,840
Buffalo come.

343
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
How can you tell?

344
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,260
Ear sticky.

345
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,180
Eww.

346
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,120
And so there were three off to seek the Wizard.

347
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,120
By now the yellow brick toad was getting a little tired and his hopping was erratic.

348
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,060
Our Zeros found themselves in a real crummy neighborhood.

349
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,420
Whoa.

350
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,200
Let's stick together, you guys.

351
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,200
This looks like a rough part of the forest.

352
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll say.

353
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll say it is.

354
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,240
Okay, hold on.

355
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,680
I'll do it right there.

356
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,140
Grab some sky, you guys.

357
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,480
This here's a stick up.

358
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,660
Look out, look out.

359
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,280
A dumb cracker has guitar pointed at us.

360
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,400
Better do as say guitar might be loaded.

361
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,760
That's right, he's loaded.

362
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,080
Like me.

363
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,980
I'll loan some cowboy days.

364
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,720
Give me all you valuables.

365
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,180
Else I'll fill you full of riffs.

366
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,540
I'll fill you full of riffs.

367
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,320
Yeah, like this.

368
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,300
That's pretty stupid.

369
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,680
Riffs can't hurt us.

370
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,840
That's absurd, you silly ass.

371
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,860
Call me names.

372
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,180
I mean it.

373
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,400
I mean it.

375
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,260
I didn't mean it.

376
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,500
I know I'm no good.

377
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,420
Don't look at me scornfully.

378
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Quit gazing at me in amusement.

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,100
Stop it, stop it.

380
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,700
Don't hurt me.

381
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,060
I don't know flop.

382
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,220
What a wimp.

384
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,860
This fictional cowboy character has no balls on his feet whatsoever.

385
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,720
No balls.

386
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,400
You're right.

387
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
It's my problem.

388
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,160
All my life I've been scared to try anything.

389
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,480
Scared of failing.

390
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,500
That fear's kept me from trying anything.

391
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,100
I ain't got no balls in this business.

392
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,060
I need some balls.

393
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,680
I could be so very ready.

394
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,780
I could get a heady.

395
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,160
If I only had some balls.

396
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,340
Some balls on his feet.

397
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'd be bold.

398
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I'd take chances.

399
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,440
I looked in my underpants and I found a pair of balls.

400
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,340
On his feet.

401
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh, don't feel bad fictional radio character lonesome cowboy Dave.

402
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,280
You can come to Animal World City with us to see the Wizard of Bob's.

403
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,240
I'm sure he'd cut you some slack too.

404
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,820
And give you your feet some balls you need to get somewhere in your singing career.

405
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,160
You really think so?

406
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,760
Yeah, come with us.

407
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,380
Yeah, come on.

408
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,840
Okay.

409
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,320
I'm sure he'd cut you some slack too.

410
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,320


411
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,320


412
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:27,100
And so it came to pass that Ivan and his three neaters of things found the fabled Animal World City.

413
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,980
There they were taken before the great Wizard of Bob's.

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,500
In a giant production studio from behind a giant mirror they heard,

415
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,940
What is it you wish from the great Bob's?

416
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,520
Why are you before me?

417
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,580
I need some balls.

418
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,320
I need a good dependable mantra.

419
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,260
I need someone to take this ball peen hammer out of my cranium and give me a brain.

420
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
I gotta get back to Dallas.

421
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,880
See, I've got these lawsuits pending and it's just a terrible situation.

422
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,760
You've gotta help me.

423
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,180
Silence!

424
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,820
Enough of your banalities.

425
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,140
For me, you cut to some slack.

426
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,320
And give these things you seek to me.

427
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,320


428
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,320


429
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,320


430
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,320


431
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,320


432
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,380
You must, you seek, prove yourself worthy.

433
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:35,660
You must find the wicked program director of the North, Bob Bean, and bring back his pipe to me.

434
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,340
Bob Bean's here too? In Bob's?

435
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,720
Funny how art imitates reality.

436
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,380
And so our Zero's headed north.

437
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,120
Over the lake toward the tower of Bob Bean's.

438
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,740
But Bob Bean's was not one without tricks up his armless sleeve.

439
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,280
He'd seen them coming in a trailer and sent his army of flying junkies.

440
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,340
That's right, an army of flying junkies to kidnap Ivan and leave the others scrabbling for their livelihoods.

441
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,120
The flying junkies, with their hypodermics and cigarette papers, did just that.

442
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,320
They brought Ivan to Bob Bean's, the wicked program director.

443
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,320


444
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:24,780
The TV executive of the North and Psycho, Lonesome, and Scabby were forced to find the tower the hard way.

445
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,700
Probably by bus.

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,540
You! It's you!

447
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,940
You've even come to a strange land and ripped off the Church of the Subgenius here!

448
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,340
In a land called Bob's!

449
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,340
Is nothing sacred!

450
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,020
No, that's right.

451
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,080
It's working on Earth, it'll work here.

452
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,320
True, Bob Bean's here.

453
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,660
True, you were on the scene first by about eight years.

454
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,460
True, you built up the loyal army of subgeniuses one at a time.

455
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,220
True, I am a blatant attempt to cash in on your fame.

456
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,300
But, but in the land of Bob's, they haven't heard of you yet.

457
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,720
And they won't either.

458
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,280
Flying junkies, take him away!

459
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,300
Nothing can stop me, not even the Wizard of Bob's!

460
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,560
I'll get him too!

461
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,940
Well, it looks like the wicked programmer will have his way.

462
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,380
But wait, who is that lurking in the shadows watching these events?

463
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,680
Why, it's Lonesome, Scabby, and Psycho.

464
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,280
Busters must have been on time for a change.

465
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,760
Look at that! That evil programmer has Ivan over a barrel of junkies!

466
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,480
Hey, wait a minute!

467
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,180
This is the part of the story where we throw a bucket of water on it and dissolve it!

468
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,300
Wouldn't you know it? No way!

469
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,940
Scabby, put your drooling to good use!

470
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,580
Here, fill bucket with your drool!

471
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,980
And we'll throw that on evil programmer!

472
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,440
Keep going!

473
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,060
A little bit more!

474
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,840
Okay, great!

475
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,480
Hey, you Bob Beans, try a bucket of scabby drool on for size!

476
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,560
No!

477
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,440
What are you doing?

478
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,220
No!

479
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,460
What are you doing?

480
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,460
I'm moaning!

481
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm moaning!

482
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,140
I'm moaning!

483
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,160
What a world order!

484
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,460
What a world order!

485
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,120
What a world order!

486
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:39,240
And so it came to pass, like a third in ten, that they brought the pipe back to the Wizard of Bobs and received their just rewards.

487
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,560
For you, Scabby, the one who wants brains!

488
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,000
Who needs brains?

489
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,700
Some of the smartest people in the world don't have brains.

490
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,800
No, but they all have this.

491
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,840
Loose change.

492
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Because loose change is common sense, and common sense are better than brains.

493
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,560
And you, Injun, who is searching for soul,

494
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,920
Here's tickets for ten shows at the Apollo,

495
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,800
And ten meals at Little Sister's Savvy Soul Food Diner.

496
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,420
If you don't have your soul back,

497
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:14,540
You can't get your soul back.

498
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,540


499
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,540


500
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,540


501
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,540


502
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,700
After this, you're already dead.

503
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,640
And you, cowboy,

504
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,200
In search of balls,

505
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,460
You've already had them all along.

506
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,480
You see,

507
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,980
As a child, your parents let you take

508
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,220
Ancient oriental martial arts.

509
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,820
Part of the exercises

510
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,540
Was hiding the testicles

511
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,700
Inside your body.

512
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,220
Now, put your thumb in your mouth,

513
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,580
And blow real hard!

514
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,420
Wow! What a difference!

515
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
My voice is deeper!

516
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm gonna be famous!

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,720
Gee, Ivan, everybody's got what they wanted!

518
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,440
Except you!

519
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,780
Yeah, what about Ivan, Wizard?

520
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,640
How can he get back to Dallas?

521
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,800
Very simply.

522
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,860
Just click your Air Jordans

523
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,200
Together three times

524
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,900
And say,

525
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,440
I wish I was in Dallas.

526
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,960
Oh, well, chumps,

527
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,400
This looks like

528
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,800
Where we part for good.

529
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,880
I'll miss every one of you

530
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,180
Very much.

531
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,220
Goodbye, scabby.

532
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,060
Goodbye, psycho.

533
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,500
Goodbye, lonesome.

534
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,420
And thanks.

535
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,240
We'll see you again, maybe.

536
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,160
I wish I was in Dallas.

537
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,080
I wish I was in Dallas.

538
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,900
I wish I was in Dallas.

539
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,240
I wish I was in Dallas.

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,280
I wish I was in Dallas.

541
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,080
I wish I was in Dallas!

542
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
I wish I was in Dallas.

543
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,300
I wish I was in Dallas.

544
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,780
I wish I was in Dallas.

545
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Is he going to be alright, Doc?

546
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,100
Looks like he's coming out of it.

547
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm back!

548
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,520
I'm back in Dallas!

549
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,460
Hooray!

550
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Or did I never leave?

551
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,720
Oh, my head!

552
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,180
He suffered a little concussion,

553
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,660
But he'll be alright.

554
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,260
Boy, I had the strangest dream.

555
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,240
I dreamed I was in the land of Bob's

556
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
And I met these fictional radio characters

557
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,620
And you were all in it!

558
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,560
But it was a dream, huh?

559
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,540
Just a dream.

560
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,340
It was only a dream.

561
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,560
Ivan, there's these three people

562
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
From northeast Ohio

563
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,220
Who wish to speak to you.

564
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,600
Hey, you don't know me, but

565
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
You don't know me, but

566
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,880
My name's Lone Jim Cowboy Dave,

567
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,020
But you don't know me, but

568
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,380
Me, Psycho Pathfinder, pleased to meet you.

569
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,900
That's Scabby Days over there.

570
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,560
Listen, we do a thing called

571
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,020
Brain Rot Radio Theatre at WCSB.

572
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,800
That's WCSB in Cleveland, Ohio,

573
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,960
And we got a hip idea for you.

574
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,800
Boy, you boys look fairly familiar.

575
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,120
Maybe overly familiar.

576
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,060
You know, I can use you three

577
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,440
To help fight this cancer from Canada

578
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,260
That's causing me so much grief.

579
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,400
Yeah.

580
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,100
Yeah, I could use you three.

581
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,720
So, uh, now, what's your hip idea?

582
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,040
Well, we got this really cool idea

583
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,820
For a great radio show for you.

584
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,400
Yeah.

585
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,540
Yeah.

586
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Listen, listen to this concept.

587
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,680
Big Wind takes you to the

588
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,860
Wizard of Bob's.

589
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,460
Get it? Wizard of Bob's? Get it?

590
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,600
Uh, well, sorry, boys.

591
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,180
It's already been done.

592
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,560
It's already been done.

593
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,920
Boy, you three look familiar.

594
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,620
Boy, you three look familiar.

595
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,220
I never forget a face, but

596
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,560
In you three's case, I'll make an exception.

597
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,080
In you three's case, I'll make an exception.

598
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
Well, this has been a fairy tale.

599
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,400
Well, this has been a fairy tale.

600
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,540
Kind of film noir, but

601
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,940
But in every fairy tale

602
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,100
Comes some truth, some moral.

603
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,860
And the truthful moral of this story

604
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,580
And the truthful moral of this story is this.

605
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,060
Do not accept substitutes.

606
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,260
Look for the subgenius trademark

607
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,200
Look for the subgenius trademark on the label.

608
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,540
And keep a wary and weathered eye

609
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,840
On the northern horizons

610
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,360
For a Canadian invasion.

611
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,420
If you see anyone resembling Canadian

612
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,020
Shoot first.

613
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,060
Ask questions later.

614
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,400
Sorry about that premature

615
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,460
Immaculate conception a minute ago.

616
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,600
We're broken people.

617
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,100
We're broken people.

618
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
We're broken people.

619
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,680
We're broken people.

620
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,540
We're broken people.

621
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:48,580
We're broken people.

622
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,480
And they shall bleed

623
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,400
And travail

624
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,960
In their sorrow.

625
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,400
But unto them shall come

626
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,520
The voice of the ark of the heavens

627
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,360
And say, let there be

628
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,800
No wailing and

629
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,360
Remonstracing.

630
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,220
For ye all now walk in the house

631
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,460
Of Jehovah One. And if thou dost not

632
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,480
Walk, thou shalt crawl

633
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,200
On the stumps

634
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,420
Of what were legs.

635
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,380
For mine is the hand

636
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,320
That makes, and mine

637
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,220
Is the house of

638
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,580
Pain.

639
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,460
This is and is not, but lay ye

640
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,300
Down the tones and hooks of the brain

641
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,060
For these are evil

642
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,360
And they are

643
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,320
Unclean in the eyes

644
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,100
Of Jehovah.

645
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,460
For the brokers and the money-chains

646
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,540
Shall be snatched and

647
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,100
Rubbered, and from their faces

648
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,560
Shall be burnt their noses, and from their

649
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,680
Loins dried the fluids

650
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,460
The fluids, ah yes,

651
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,140
The fluids of the babe.

652
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,100
And it shall be gone

653
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,740
Into drainage.

654
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,120
Now that was pre-scripture 79 through 83.

655
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,380
And what do these things mean?

656
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,280
What are we really looking at?

657
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,260
The Revelation X is a pre-scripture of dogs

658
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,280
That Jehovah One gave to him.

659
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,400
That's him, quote him, unquote, end quotes.

660
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,320
And remember,

661
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,660
The most fearful warning ever given to subgeniuses

662
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,960
Is the warning found in

663
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,600
Batch 22, Neuronica 17,

664
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,140
Book of Moronix 73.

665
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,460
Which is the promise and warning,

666
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,320
The warning, yes, of X-Day.

667
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
When the men from Planet X

668
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,300
Will arise and descend

669
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,900
And rupture up,

670
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,180
Rupture up all the faithful

671
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,660
Twenty dollar dues paying subgenius

672
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,320
Ministers in a blaze of

673
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,780
Glory, not unlike the blaze

674
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,720
Of gunfire heard outside

675
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,340
Our little compound here. And why are

676
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,740
We so afraid?

677
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,320
Because the light of the great land

678
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,060
On that day will be speckled

679
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,180
With what looks like thousands

680
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,480
Of burning monks.

681
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,980
And these are the true believers

682
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,440
Being lifted up into the escape vessels

683
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,580
Of the sex goddesses.

684
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,200
Ah, yes.

685
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,760
And the other light on that dreadful morning,

686
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,820
The other light on the helmet

687
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,920
Of the queen of all the UFOs

688
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Will resume blinking.

689
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,720
And on that day, you boys had better hope

690
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,580
You're on her good side,

691
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,580
Lest ye be fried

692
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,180
With those pinks

693
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,840
In thy own fat.

694
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,640
Huh. But we haven't seen your

695
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,680
Love offerings, so how's she gonna know you

696
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,960
From some federal agent?

697
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,140
And we want to save those federal agents, too.

698
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
All of them outside.

699
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,580
We want them, too, to have their own

700
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,020
Fortified compounds

701
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,420
And fifteen wives or husbands.

702
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,500
We don't want them, but Dobbs said

703
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
We had to have them. And we want

704
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,700
Those agents to be on our side

705
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,080
Before they come raiding us again.

706
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,660
That's all we're saying.

707
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,280
Bob's return

708
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,800
Will herald a millennium

709
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,600
Of rule under

710
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,360
The House of Dogs.

711
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,260
Huh. Well, what is this saying?

712
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,300
It's a rule of rule in slack.

713
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,100
Slack is the law. Slack over will.

714
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,100
Isn't that right, Will?

715
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,580
Old Faithful Will's here with me, friends.

716
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,940
He's trying to hold himself in one piece, too.

717
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,640
He's got a sort of

718
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,760
Unexpected vasectomy from a bullet.

719
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,700
But he's doing fine.

720
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,440
And Father Joe Mama's here, too,

721
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,600
With his video equipment,

722
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,120
Recording our last stand.

723
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,740
Whoa!

724
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,900
Excuse me.

725
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,080
Recording our last stand

726
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,340
For posterity.

727
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,680
Actually, you might call it the last brunch.

728
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,140
We've got a

729
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,880
Coke machine here

730
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,420
And a lot of quarters, so

731
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,760
Don't worry, we can hold out indefinitely.

732
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,980
But we promise

733
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,680
To come out when this tape

734
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,340
Has been played to all

735
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,200
The sentient beings on Earth Farm 1

736
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,900
Including dolphins, whales,

737
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
And those gorillas

738
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,420
Which have learned a sign language.

739
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,180
Oh, oh,

740
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,820
Excuse me, Will.

741
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,080
Yeah, I'll move out of the way here.

742
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,840
Friends, I have to move

743
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,880
So that Will can drag that old lady's

744
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,160
Corpse out of the studio.

745
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,440
But that old gal, she'll be sleeping

746
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,680
With Bob tonight.

747
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,500
She'll be in Bob's arms.

748
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,340
Maybe she's one of the lucky ones.

749
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,160
Now, uh,

750
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,840
I hope you can hear me okay

751
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,440
Over the bullet, uh,

752
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,820
Gun...

753
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,620
Uh,

754
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,200
Gunfire out there.

755
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,740
Many of you may mock us

756
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,500
And call us kooks and cultists

757
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,180
When we talk about the conspiracy

758
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,060
Of the normals that's always

759
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,720
Taken away our slack, and yours too.

760
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,580
Oh, and you say, oh, ho, ho,

761
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,000
Isn't that funny, those nuts

762
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,100
Think that there's a conspiracy.

763
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,300
Well, we happen to be looking down the barrel

764
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,360
Of about 10,000 assault weapons,

765
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,160
Uh, helicopter gun mounts

766
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,180
And grenade launchers, and even more

767
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,020
Than we've got, and I don't know about you,

768
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,240
Dear friend, but that sure looks

769
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,760
Like a conspiracy to me.

770
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,460
And what was our crime, I ask you that?

771
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,920
Uh, being weird,

772
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,820
That's about all. Uh, so,

773
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,200
Some of our so-called activities didn't

774
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,780
Strike you as being normal enough.

775
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,320
We didn't hurt anybody. Uh, those children

776
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,840
Volunteered to build that saucer landing pad.

777
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,240
That golfer's head

778
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,220
Was already decapitated before

779
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,560
We started launching it.

780
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,500
And what about the right to bear arms?

781
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,100
Well, we can only bear arms big enough to kill each other,

782
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,660
But not big enough to fight the conspiracy?

783
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,400
Huh. Well,

784
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,760
They deported Reverend Sun Yung Moon,

785
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,320
But you didn't complain, cause you weren't a Moonie.

786
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,720
Uh, they deported

787
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,160
Sri Bhagwan Rajneesh,

788
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,740
But you kept mum,

789
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,800
Cause you weren't a Rajneesh.

790
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,020
Well, they went and made Jim Jones

791
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,580
Part of a CIA mind control experiment,

792
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,800
But you didn't gripe,

793
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,060
Cause you weren't in the people's temple.

794
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,300
And they jailed Jim Baker,

795
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,680
And defrocked Jimmy Swaggart,

796
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,920
But you didn't care,

797
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,800
Cause you didn't steal money, or

798
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,300
Rape church secretaries, or frequent, uh,

799
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,160
Frequent po-bucker prostitutes,

800
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,300
Or at least you didn't get caught.

801
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,140
Now they're cheatin', the one true

802
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,220
Bob Dobbs, the one who isn't a

803
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,020
Gibbering Canadian, but you

804
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,040
Sit there on your duff, cause

805
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,260
You're not one of the 13 original

806
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,240
Apostles. Well, when they finally

807
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,660
Come for you, my friend,

808
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,200
There ain't gonna be nobody left to care about you.

809
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,040
And the sons of Israel

810
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,500
Shall be snatched up, per scriptures 107,

811
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,460
Uh, and behold,

812
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,100
My servant shall

813
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,440
Prosper, it says here, he shall be exalted,

814
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Uh-huh, and lifted up,

815
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,980
Uh-huh, and shall be

816
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,400
Very high, very high, what is that?

817
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,200
Uh, he who knoweth the fools

818
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,140
Will prophesy for me,

819
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,920
Shall be made over

820
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,660
Men, over men, uh-huh,

821
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,160
Many will be astonished at him, for his

822
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,200
Appearance, his appearance, uh-huh,

823
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,900
Is so marred,

824
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,220
Well, beyond human semblance,

825
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,080
And his forms beyond

826
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,820
That of the sons of men. These

827
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,260
Who are over men, who have

828
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,220
Followed my almighty word,

829
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,200
Shall be the ministry of the

830
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,140
Angelic host, and they shall

831
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,320
Uh, speak for them. Now that's

832
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,180
Spiritual, that's spiritual, huh.

833
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,160
That shows that this

834
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,200
Show is not to be messed with,

835
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,180
Nor pranked with, by anybody

836
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,120
Who would dare think they

837
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,940
Can make, uh, speculations,

838
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,020
Or private opinions, or

839
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,000
Unlock the mystery of Bob's

840
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,700
Pipe, and the, the information

841
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,660
Therein, uh-huh.

842
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,700
Uh, now, pre-scripture says,

843
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,540
Uh, that a stang

844
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,380
Was made from the smithy,

845
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,300
Hmm, the two-edged

846
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,340
S-word,

847
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,020
S-word, s-word,

848
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,920
You might say, uh-huh, well,

849
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,900
And what does that mean? Which was made from

850
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,160
Dob's own pipe stem.

851
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,040
Uh, could it be that the stang

852
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,100
Was used by, buh-buh,

853
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,220
Bob, huh, to write down

854
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,960
Odin's message that would someday be

855
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,140
Revealed by Bob?

856
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,180
Well, I'm just gonna have to let you think about

857
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,060
That. We, we

858
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,080
Don't have to leave the compound here until this

859
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,120
Tape is all played out. And now,

860
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,160
Uh, we have some more holy tapes

861
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,140
Here that you're gonna have to listen to

862
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,180
If you want us to ever leave this radio station.

863
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,340
And then I believe that, uh,

864
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,040
Well, I believe that Father Joe Mama

865
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,140
Has a few words to say.

866
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,560
Welcome to Dallas, Father Joe Mama.

867
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,180
It is so good to see you here.

868
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,780
Uh, I'm gonna

869
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,040
Try to drown out this, uh, gun

870
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,940
Pop- wait, get down! Don't want you to get-

871
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,140
Stay away from the window! I'm trying to get in the back down there!

872
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,640
Okay. Keep it low! Keep it low!

873
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,120
Get down! Uh, can you

874
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,840
Hook your headphones in? Uh,

875
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,740
Try sticking them in there.

876
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,060
Does, does that mean anything to you?

877
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,060
Yes, Reverend Stang,

878
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,220
Uh, this is gonna be, uh, quite difficult, uh,

879
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,780
To proceed under these, uh,

880
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Conditions. But we're

881
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,140
Not gonna give up until we've had a chance

882
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,100
To cleanse the minds of all

883
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,960
Our many listeners.

884
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,460
And with that, dear friends,

885
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,040
We're going to lead into our most

886
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
Pronounced of all wills

887
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,140
And testaments, the word

888
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,800
Of J.R. Bob Dockery.

889
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,940
You see, friends,

890
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,680
The sermon tonight is entitled,

891
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
The Last

892
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
Chance. Yes, friends,

893
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,960
1998 is fast approaching,

894
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,180
And a lot of people have come to expect the church

895
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,880
To start singing a different tune about

896
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,080
Judgment Day. They say, hey, did you

897
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,040
Hear the news? The Berlin Wall

898
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,160
Has fallen. Things are getting better. We say,

899
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,800
Is that so? They say, hey,

900
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,140
Did you read the papers? The Russians are

901
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,000
Now our friends. Things are getting better.

902
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,620
We say, is that so?

903
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,900
They say, hey, did you see

904
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,060
CNN? We won the war. Things are

905
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,880
Getting better. Is that so?

906
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,060
And now they come a-running and a-churring,

907
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,120
Roll out the barrel. We have

908
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,180
A new president. The Republicans are out.

909
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,080
The recession is over. It's the year of the

910
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,640
Woman. Everybody get naked. Wooo!

911
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,840
You poor

912
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,540
Pitiful little pigs!

913
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,180
Do you really think an eternity of

914
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,200
Sin can be erased so easily?

915
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,260
Are we now supposed to

916
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,800
Embrace the conspiracy?

917
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,200
And call off the excess invasion?

918
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,200
Do you actually believe

919
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,660
That you could defuse an entire

920
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Revolution with a few

921
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,120
Scraps of conspiracy

922
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,540
Compromise?

923
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,340
Never!

924
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,260

To avert bloody overthrow.

953
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,480
Well, well, well.

954
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,020
The world is getting better now, isn't it?

955
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,840
We should just call off the invasion before

956
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,380
It's too late. Wrong!

957
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,180
You can fool some of the subgenies, some of the

958
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,380
Overmen, any of the time.

959
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,700
But you can't fool any of the overmen, any of the time.

960
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,480
They're much too attuned to the wily ways

961
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,440
Of the wicked ones.

962
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,220
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pico President.

963
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,920
Yes, you. The one with the firm handshake

964
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,960
And the easy smile.

965
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,740
You're not tricking anybody with your

966
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,640
Bold new vision or JFK idealism.

967
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,040
We in the church go by

968
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,420
One credo and one credo only.

969
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,100
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you,

970
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,040
But what you can do to the conspiracy.

971
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,020
And come July 5th, 1990,

972
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,980
We're going to put the conspiracy

973
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,840
And we're going to

974
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,220
Line up against the wall,

975
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,980
Execute the ringleaders, and along with

976
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
Anyone else who tries to stop us.

977
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,580
Now to some, this may seem a little,

978
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,460
Well,

979
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,380
Extreme. That's perfectly normal.

980
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,260
To the average man in the street,

981
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,400
Witnessing a public execution of a criminal

982
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,940
May appear extreme.

983
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,580
After all, chances are that the street man

984
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,400
Is unfamiliar with the crimes of the criminal.

985
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,240
He was too busy making a living

986
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,000
To notice the misdeeds, the crimes,

987
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,480
The condemn perpetrated on society

988
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,200
Before being brought to justice.

989
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,140
Add to that, the criminal's emotional last words,

990
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,640
His pleas for mercy,

991
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,100
His insistence that everything he did

992
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,440
Was innocent, that he is not guilty.

993
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,600
And now imagine the prisoner's family

994
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,640
Stepping forth begging for his life,

995
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,400
And witnesses filing forward

996
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,700
To testify to the innocence

997
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,940
Of this great man so wrongly accused.

998
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,580
It should be no surprise

999
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,160
That even an intelligent but uninformed

1000
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,880
Person would find themselves feeling

1001
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
Sorry for the poor soul,

1002
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,500
And wishing him a presidential pardon.

1003
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,260
If respected newspapers were produced

1004
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,840
And showed article after article

1005
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,920
Supporting the accused, even the most skeptical

1006
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,760
In the crowd would likely become sympathetic.

1007
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,760
Why?

1008
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,000
Because they would see in that individual

1009
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,780
Before them not a criminal guilty

1010
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,700
About the cruelest crimes

1011
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,460
Of humanity against humanity,

1012
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,920
But themselves,

1013
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,720
Falsely accused and condemned to death

1014
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,400
For crimes they never committed.

1015
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,280
By now, the executioners

1016
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,900
Should be more worried about their lives

1017
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,260
Than the prisoner should his.

1018
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,740
The crowd might well demand clemency,

1019
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,060
And if refused, storm the guards

1020
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,120
And free the prisoner by force.

1021
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,800
If you were part of this intervention,

1022
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,440
You would probably feel proud

1023
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,120
For the good deed you performed

1024
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,380
And the terrible injustice you averted.

1025
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,240
But, if a few weeks later

1026
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,160
You learned that the prisoner you saved

1027
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,420
Was an insane serial killer,

1028
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,520
That the witnesses that testified

1029
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,380
Were all paid actors,

1030
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,540
And the newspapers you believed

1031
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,960
Were all frauds,

1032
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,820
You might start to regret

1033
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,320
Having been so compassionate.

1034
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,740
Then, if by some quirk of fate

1035
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,860
You stumbled into

1036
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,600
Incontrovertible evidence

1037
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,340
That you, the man that you freed,

1038
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,840
Was now devoted

1039
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,720
To his entire life,

1040
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,520
To destroying yours,

1041
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,260
That his new obsession

1042
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,200
Was to capture you, torture you,

1043
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,980
And sell your loved ones into slavery,

1044
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,820
Well, you might start to feel

1045
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,340
Anger.

1046
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,800
Anger at yourself for being

1047
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,640
A fool, anger at the actors

1048
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,960
Who tricked you in the newspapers

1049
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,080
That lied to you, and anger

1050
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,760
At all the mental midgets still running

1051
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,360
Around out there claiming the bastard

1052
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,020
Was really reformed, only misunderstood.

1053
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,300
This, dear friends,

1054
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,980
Is how we at the church

1055
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,420
Feel about the conspiracy.

1056
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,660
Each and every one of us

1057
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,000
At one time or another

1058
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,280
Believed the conspiracy.

1059
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,220
Each and every one of us

1060
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,640
In one way or another

1061
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,800
Served the conspiracy

1062
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,760
And every single one of us

1063
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,980
Knows in no uncertain terms

1064
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,060
That the conspiracy is out

1065
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,880
To get us.

1066
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,720
Every day it tries to capture us,

1067
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,860
Torture us, and enslave our kind,

1068
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,920
And every single time

1069
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,940
We get close to destroying the monster,

1070
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,680
Some well-meaning,

1071
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,720
But ignorant bystander starts whining

1072
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,000
That we're being too

1073
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Extreme.

1074
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,760
They say that the conspiracy is actually innocent

1075
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,620
Because they read all about it in the

1076
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,940
Conspiracy newspapers, or saw it all

1077
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,580
Explained on conspiracy TV.

1078
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,940
They insist that our allegations

1079
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,180
Are exaggerated,

1080
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,660
That the conspiracy is getting better,

1081
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,160
And that we should just mellow out.

1082
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,020
And then they try to

1083
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,240
Tell us that we

1084
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,060
Ought to give the conspiracy

1085
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,280
SLACK!

1086
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,620
Dear, dear friends,

1087
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,280
These poor misguided morons

1088
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,180
May be in the dark now just as we were before,

1089
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,040
And we may have acted back then

1090
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,420
Just as stupid as they're acting now.

1091
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,000
But that doesn't mean

1092
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,780
That we don't have the right,

1093
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,860
Nay, the sacred duty,

1094
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,720
To destroy the conspiracy

1095
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,180
First chance we get!

1096
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,080
Don't be taken in by any last-minute

1097
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Media blitz that tries to convince

1098
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,720
You that the conspiracy has suddenly

1099
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,200
Turned over a new leaf,

1100
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,500
Because it hasn't, dear friends.

1101
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,600
The noose is around its neck!

1102
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,740
What do you expect the conspiracy to say?

1103
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,460
We deserve to die?

1104
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,600
Kill us, please? No!

1105
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,140
The conspiracy will look and act

1106
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,800
Nicer than it has ever looked

1107
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,680
Or acted before!

1108
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,320
Don't be fooled!

1109
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,620
If you hesitate even for a second,

1110
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,200
You give the conspiracy

1111
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,020
A chance to win

1112
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,240
The crowd over.

1113
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,120
And if that happens, dear friends,

1114
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,800
You may find yourself on trial

1115
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,240
With no more X's around to pull your fat

1116
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,400
From the firing squad!

1117
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,640
There's only one X day.

1118
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,540
Do not blow it.

1119
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,360
Come July 5th, 1998,

1120
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,140
You will kill the conspiracy!

1121
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,960
Thou shalt cut off its head

1122
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,020
And launch it through the bloody cosmos!

1123
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,000
And it is the word of our

1124
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,700
Praise Bob!

1125
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,780
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

1126
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,860
Praise damn God Bobby!

1127
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,200
Aye, aye, aye, aye!

1128
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,820
Oh, my co- Jeez, why four

1129
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,680
More people were killed right here

1130
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,880
Inside this compound while Father Joe

1131
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
Mama was ranting, and in fact I think

1132
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,780
He took an arterial wound to the

1133
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,880
Back of the knee. It's blood but it's

1134
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,300
Just juice to kill for Bob.

1135
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,080
Friends, oh,

1136
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,840
Praise Father Joe, praise those

1137
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,560
Who are fighting with us, who are,

1138
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,380
And look at those Bobbies out there

1139
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,580
Throwing themselves into the path of those

1140
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,740
Conspiracy bullets to keep us

1141
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,860
On the air. That's a lot better than I can

1142
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,580
Say for some of you people that pledged

1143
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,300
But never sent your money.

1144
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,100
Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

1145
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,020
Oh, there's that guy falling off the

1146
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,880
It's the third time I've seen

1147
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
That same agent fall off that same roof

1148
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,000
Back there. Reinforcements, over to the left!

1149
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,440
Watch that door.

1150
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,800
Would somebody do something about that dead

1151
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,960
Dog that's laying over there? That's making

1152
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,300
Me sick. Chef!

1153
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,960
Oh, friends, oh, well,

1154
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,960
How much, how much time? Well, only about

1155
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,540
Ten minutes before we finally,

1156
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,680
Volunteerly, uh, leave the

1157
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,860
Radio studio, uh,

1158
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,720
Carting our, our

1159
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,840
Canisters of souls and our

1160
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,940
Tactical nuclear weapons

1161
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,740
With us. Oh, but before

1162
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,920
We go out to our almost certain

1163
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,920
Death, uh, we'll, uh, give

1164
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,920
Credit to, uh, Media Barrage editors

1165
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,300
Who have worked on this show, inadvertently.

1166
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,280
Um, uh,

1167
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,840
Some of the, uh, barrages

1168
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,920
You heard and will, uh, are about to

1169
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,440
Hear were by Wes Jenkins

1170
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,900
Of Radio Shorts,

1171
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,500
The West Coast

1172
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,780
Brain Rot Theater, yes, in San

1173
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,680
Francisco, and also a cassette called

1174
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,520
Audio Bull Dada by

1175
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,840
Michael Taylor Duke of

1176
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,600
Montgomery, Alabama.

1177
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,820
And, uh,

1178
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,420
Little, little bit of Reverend

1179
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,240
Lucas there and so forth. Friends,

1180
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,340
Okay, we're gonna be, uh,

1181
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,740
We're gonna be communicating with Bob for the

1182
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,960
Next few minutes, so I'm gonna sign off

1183
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,080
Here and, uh, listen closely.

1184
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,360
And statecraft,

1185
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,960
Look at the pressed in kindness

1186
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,220
We avoid thee

1187
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,440
Upon these American circumstances

1188
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,200
Who should fled to thee

1189
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,960
From the staff of the tyrannized

1190
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,960
And prostrate themselves

1191
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,080
Upon thy cordial security

1192
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,160
Yearned to signify

1193
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,880
Henceforth tentative

1194
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,000
Singular upon thee.

1195
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,300
To thee

1196
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,760
Organize they charisma

1197
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,700
For the honorable of their justification.

1198
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,140
To thee be adequate

1199
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,880
They now consider up for that

1200
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,200
Support and succor which

1201
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,340
Thou alone canst furnish.

1202
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,040
Grab them thus,

1203
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,260
Nirvana dad,

1204
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,520
Above thy cultivate mind.

1205
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,860
Furnish them erudition

1206
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,160
In Congress, and pluck in the grassland.

1207
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,920
Overcome the

1208
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,680
Vicious devise of our brutal

1209
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,500
Colleague.

1210
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,080
God in heaven looks to be a rock, doesn't he?

1211
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,600
Oh, hard rock God, right?

1212
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,840
God's long, God's hard.

1213
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,820
But wait a minute.

1214
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,660
Through Christ we can see that God is not

1215
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,240
As hard as you think he is.

1216
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,600
Look at God. Come up hither

1217
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,100
In the light of the judgment,

1218
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,920
And see the Father on the throne.

1219
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,740
See the book in his right hand,

1220
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,500
And watch him give it to Christ,

1221
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,000
And watch him open the first seal,

1222
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,680
And let's see about this man on the white horse

1223
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,860
Who has a crown and a bow.

1224
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,920
He once attracted more than

1225
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,280
One hundred thousand to the city gate.

1226
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:05,680


1227
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,120
...

1228
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,540
...

1229
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:10,840
...

1230
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,260
...

1231
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,260


1232
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,260


1233
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,980
One of the few things they can do with their time

1234
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,200
Is listen to radio or watch television.

1235
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,420
He financed the communist revolution

1236
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,560
In Russia with bank robberies.

1237
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,140
...

1238
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,300
...

1239
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,440
...

1240
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,460
...

1241
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,320
...

1242
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,660
...

1243
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,220
...

1244
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,940
...

1245
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,400
forget everything?

1246
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:44,920
All right.

1247
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,000
I'll tell you what,

1248
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,460
I'm going to bring

1249
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,140
this tape recorder.

1250
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,900
Science has freed us.

1251
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,760
Chemistry has freed us.

1252
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,380
Art has freed us.

1253
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,200
Education has freed us.

1254
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,360
Somehow we think

1255
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,520
drugs are freeing us.

1256
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,040
We supposedly have

1257
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,040
broken a thousand

1258
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,100
tyrannies,

1259
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,660
and yet we may be

1260
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,460
referred to as

1261
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,380
restless men,

1262
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,140
intoxicated with

1263
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,260
a sense of freedom.

1264
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Now God is the one

1265
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,080
who has written.

1266
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,520
My heart isn't done

1267
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,080
in a good manner.

1268
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,980
I speak of the things

1269
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,700
which I have made.

1270
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,580
Is God a maker?

1271
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,860
Is he a creator?

1272
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,140
What does he want

1273
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,580
to talk about?

1274
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,680
He looks like the little

1275
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,440
termite from the

1276
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,500
Woody Woodpecker cartoons.

1277
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,260
You know the one that

1278
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,860
was always chewing

1279
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,420
down the house?

1280
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,360
Shut up,

1281
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,100
and grow up.

1282
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:30,880
That's right,

1283
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,780
that's right.

1284
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,020
Now we're tied up,

1285
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,680
that's better.

1286
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,480
Now, here's what happens.

1287
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,660
We go into sudden death.

1288
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,840
They are passed on.

1289
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,900
I'm a mother,

1290
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,040
I thoroughly age.

1291
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,940
I examined her,

1292
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,840
and she's not only

1293
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,040
merely dead,

1294
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,060
she's really

1295
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,160
most sincerely dead.

1296
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:52,860
That's it?

1297
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,000
That's it.

1298
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,580
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1299
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,400
This just in?

1300
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,620
This, uh, uh,

1301
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,700
news release.

1302
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,400
We will not welcome you

1303
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,040
so much today.

1304
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,360
Did they mention anything

1305
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,240
about the claims

1306
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,060
of child abuse?

1307
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,620
Yeah, morning.

1308
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,960
Yeah, that's what they

1309
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,980
always try to get into.

1310
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,540
OK, friends,

1311
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,880
this may be our last chance

1312
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,580
to give that subgenios

1313
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,060
post office box number.

1314
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,380
There will still be

1315
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,020
a few free subgeniuses

1316
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,220
left after tonight.

1317
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,040
Uh, that you, that we'll

1318
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,700
still be able to send you

1319
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,680
that material,

1320
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,820
that free information

1321
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,140
about our church

1322
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,140
And it's just a church,

1323
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,960
it's just a religion.

1324
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,860
Why do they have to call it a cult?

1325
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,160
Why do they have to call anything a cult?

1326
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,600
Get that pencil ready.

1327
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,920
This is your last chance.

1328
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,760
It's Post Office Box.

1329
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,480
Now, you're writing to Bob now.

1330
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,900
You don't have to spell out subgenius.

1331
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,640
Just write Bob.

1332
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,760
That's spelled B-O-B, by the way, for you sub-subgeniuses.

1333
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:13,460
At Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1334
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,760
That's right, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1335
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,260
And friends, I've been speaking with Bob just now while those tapes were playing.

1336
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,540
I was speaking with Bob on the Aetheric Hotline.

1337
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,740
And now...

1338
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:37,580
I know that we said we were going to release the hostages and leave the station when the show was over.

1339
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,540
But Bob just told me...

1340
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,420
He said, now, Reverend Stagg, wait a minute.

1341
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,220
You just wait a minute.

1342
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,400
There goes that guy again.

1343
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,740
He said he changed his mind.

1344
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,080
And that we shouldn't be making it so easy on him.

1345
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,820
And we aren't going to make it easy on him.

1346
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,320
And Bob then, he said something had just come up and he had to hang up.

1347
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,140
And he's going to be calling right back to tell us when to surrender.

1348
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,400
So for now...

1349
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,820
I think we're all just going to sit back and wait for Bob's call.

1350
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,240
Will, would you go down there and get me another Coke out of that machine?

1351
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,260
Oh, God!

1352
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,940
Hey!

1353
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,960
Hey!

1354
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,160
Tell that tear gas canister to get in here!

1355
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,360
Tear gas!

1356
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,500
Tear gas!

1357
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,700
Open the window!

1358
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,640

1361
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,300
Help!

1362
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,780

1367
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,000
Help!

1368
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,140
Help!

1369
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,340
Help!

1370
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,700
Help!

1371
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:35,740
Help!

1372
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,220
Please open the window!

1373
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,300
No!

1374
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,560
Please open the door!

1375
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,260
I'm listening!

1376
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,920
I'm listening to everyone else!

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:41,920

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:41,920


1379
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,120
Excuse me.

1380
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,400
Um, how have you been listening in here!

1381
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,080
Hey!

1382
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:52,220
That is my kerana.

1383
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,220


1384
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,300

some subgeniuses, I guess,

1436
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,080
sent us in the mail just the other day from Seattle.

1437
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,760
Oh, Seattle Grunge Band.

1438
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,580
Isn't that supposed to be cool or something?

01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,160
And it looks like we got some extra time on show or something.

1440
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:16,600
So I'm gonna run just a little bit here of our good friend, ah yes.

Where man among man, man among men.

We're men among manly men, among manly manly men are we.

1444
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,940
We'll sail up north and cross the ice and cross the bear and snow fields.

01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,340
You gotta be tough and you gotta be a man to club the baby harp seal.

To club the baby harp seal.

1447

We're men among manly men, among manly manly men are we.

We'll drive out west on a buffalo hunt in a Venture Bowl and daring.

1450
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,340
We'll shoot one again and again and again while the others stand there staring.
