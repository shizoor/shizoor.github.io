Your FBI hopes through this series of programs to enlist each of you as a volunteer in the army of women engaging in serious crimes like murder, robbery, and the self-genius power of SWAT.
Neither your FBI nor any local law enforcement agency can prevent those parasites from attempting to get easy money from you, the decent citizen.
Only you can do that.
Do it by always following Bob.
But that trick never worked.
From PR News in Washington, I'm the instigator in an explosion in Phoenix, Arizona tonight.
Federal investigators in the U.S. injured dozens of passengers.
However, none suffered injuries.
President Donald Trump reports Trump is much, much worse.
President Trump is red meat for his base.
But President Trump says the president will have PR News.
The Trump is buff.
Buffing a colon.
Now one executive says President Trump says his colon is under intense scrutiny.
That's Pierce reporting.
The Dow 61-21-865.
At least one of the four detained suspects saying this is PR News.
According to that suspect.

I woke up this morning with a bad hangover
And my p fnus was missing again
Benien mio
This happens all the time
This comes in handy a lot of the time
I can leave it home when it's going to get me in trouble
I can leave it home—
rent it out when I don't need it. But now and then I go to a party, get drunk, and the next
morning I can't, for the life of me, remember what I did with it. First I looked around my apartment
and I couldn't find it, so I called up the place where the party was, they hadn't seen it either.
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet, cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes, but
not this time. So I told them if it pops up to let me know. I called a few people who were at
the party, but they were no help either. I was starting to get desperate, I really don't like
being without my penis for too long, it makes me feel like less of a man, and I really hate having
to sit down every time I take a leak. After a few hours of searching the house and calling
everyone I could think of, I was starting to get very depressed, so I went to the Kiev and ate
breakfast. Then as I walked down 2nd Avenue towards St. Mark's Place, where
the
people were, I saw a man with a broken toaster oven, all those people sell used books and other junk on the street.
I saw my penis lying on a blanket, next to a broken toaster oven, some guy was selling it, I had to buy it off him.
He wanted 22 bucks, but I talked him down to 17. I took it home, washed it off, and put it back on.
I was happy again, complete. People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached, but I don't know.
Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass, I like having a detachable penis.
No one on the street is a man with a penis.
Nobody there.
No one there.

No one there.
Nobody there.
Nobody there.
Nobody there.
Nobody there.
Intentional Venus
Detachable Penis was the name of that song and King Missile did that a long time ago.
Man, I so identify.
I actually met King Missile once at the Anti-Emmys in New York.
Long story.
Thanks to Mr. Fernando Nandi Lemur for the titles and any news.
Oh yes, dear friends, this episode of Hour of Slack, number 1790, isn't a rerun, but it will have a lot of old stuff.
I just can't stay on top of the complexities like I used to.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I want to do more live shows, but we'll have to do it while he's in the hospital with his heart and nerve diseases.
He can't do that quite yet.
Thanks to everyone.

Thanks to everyone who sent him fan letters and get well wishes, which I'm sure he'd love to see more of.
And you can send them through me, stang at subgenius dot com.
He doesn't really even have email.
His son brings his snail mail to the hospital for him.
He's okay.
I mean, he's still funny.
He's still Dave, but his phone situation is like his computer situation.
He doesn't work well with machines.
He doesn't have the kind of machinery.
In the meantime, as one of his admirers suggested, we could play some best of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, which is a good idea and easy for me to do
because I assembled a whole album of just that 20 years ago.
Not that anybody bought it.
It's probably one of the best subgenius albums.
The one guy who bought a copy said it inspired him so much that he started writing science fiction short stories.
and he got them published.
So now you can get the same sort of shot of inspiration for free.
Bob's going to kill me for not selling this stuff harder,
but hey, you know, something's going to kill me soon enough anyway.
Why not Bob?
So I'm going to edit some of the 23X Day recordings into this.
The audio isn't great because X Day happened on the Zoom teleconferencing platform.
But on the other hand, because of that, it also has lots of new faces and voices.
And I have all this best of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, all from ESO Swamp Radio,
the show on WCSB Cleveland,
hosted by the late Professor Chaz Smith for hundreds of years
until he suddenly died.
And I'm going to edit some of the 23X Day recordings into this.
And that's a reminder, my friend.
Just as Chaz boarded the saucers prematurely,
and Legume, and so many of our loved ones,
Lonesome Cowboy Dave could just suddenly up and die of a heart attack just like that.
That happened to several friends of mine when they were in their 30s.
St. Joe Riley, for instance.
Heck, it almost happened to me a few years ago.
That's why I'm going to slack off and surf the luck plane,
and follow the path of least resistance
and blow off the level of work I used to put into this damn weekly show,
now in its 1,790th episode, dang it!
So, heck, phooey.
Phooey, I say.
I'm taking it easy henceforth.
And if you get bored, touch that dial.
Oh, this music in the background, by the way, is by Blackout.
Old Reverend Blackout.
But before,
and maybe betwixt the old Dave Chaz ESO and new X Day recordings,
I'm going to get back to my Oingo Boingo kick,
and run some songs that I've decided speak to today's current events in Ameristan.
I was listening to the Oingo Boingo live album and other very old albums,
and some songs struck me as more meaningful in 2020 than they were in 1984.
In fact, they could perfectly fit into the album.
Right.
So here's a quick category of the Oingo Boingo that could perfectly, well,
be about the new, but probably short-lived species of human offshoots called anti-maskers.
This series of songs on the show, then, is dedicated to all you anti-maskers,
anti-vaxxers, and flat-earthers.
Indeed all anti-science po-buckers and pinks should feel free to include yourselves as well in that dedication.
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
A man broke into my neighborhood
He threatened the family with a loaded gun
He turned them all up and beat them real good
He took everything and he got away clean
And I can't believe that anyone would
Want to do such terrible things
Why should I care?
I hear about Fred, he's unemployed
He threw him away like a useless toy
He went down the drain after 20 long years
No warning, no pension, nobody's cares
And I can't believe that anyone would
Want to do such terrible things
But why should I care?
Why should I care?
Every time I look around this place
I see them scream but I hear no sound
And the terrible things happen down the road
It's something else that I don't even know
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
Every time I look around this place
I see them scream but I hear no sounds
And the terrible things happen down the road
There's something else that I don't even know
I heard about the Joneses, my, my, my
It happened so quick, no one knows why
But the Joneses are the best
The teenage son, he seemed okay
But his suicide ruined everyone's family
And I can't believe that anyone would
Want to do such a terrible thing
But why should I care?
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Nothing bad ever happens to me
No, no, nothing bad, nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Nothing bad ever happens to me
Nothing bad, nothing bad ever happens to me
Why should I care?
Nothing bad ever happens to me
It's the winning side
And everyone is cheering for the winning side
And the children leave their homes to join the winning side
And when Jesus comes he'll march on with the winning side
And we've got all the right answers
In the kingdom of God

Shining light
Weather on the right
And we have no fear
No, we have no fear
Waiting for the sign
We will give our lives
We will give our lives
And I feel so isolated
It's so lonely here at night
It almost feels
Like I'm in a dream

I can't hear me
I imagine that you're with me
On the winning side
We don't ask too many questions
On the winning side
And I've got this strange sensation
On the winning side
I don't recognize the faces
On the winning side
And we all live here in cages
Someone's got to be here to save us
And we all love to be just one
Right last night
Betty made a sound
We can hear meOP
With my eyes closed tight
To get to the place
Where you were
Jerry-Lynn
And I can hear YOU
When I'm up in the air
And my ears are blind



When I kiss the ground
And I like to know you better
And I like to get to know
And I'd like to know your name
I could win each ale
I did all I can


I'll tell you something, if you give me half a chance
Cause I'm on the winning side, yeah
In the sleepless night, when the blindness comes
Washing over me, like a giant wave
I'm a sandwich beach, washing over me
I am proud to be
And I'd like to take you somewhere
That you've never been before
And I'd like to take you somewhere

I feel so isolated
And I feel so all alone
Here I'm on the winning side
And I feel so all alone
Here I'm on the winning side
And I feel so all alone
Here I'm on the winning side
And I feel so all alone
Here I'm on the winning side
And I feel so all alone
Oh yeah, I'm inside
That was Oingo Boingo from the 1980s.
Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek being the main songwriters.
And now, Back in Time.
I pray. I pray.
Amino acid ancestors.
Now I die before I wake in silent void.
Galactic space shimmering molecular designs.
Are you trying to bum out the people that are tripping or something, Chaz?
Hey man, you trying to put a dodecahedron in the back of their conceptual shadow space now?
Hey.
Man, life is a joke. It's a lie.
And friends, someday you're gonna shut up like hell.
So you better make, you better shout and make a lot of noise.
Because someday your vocal cords are going to be frozen.
Just like that is snow right to the left of your, there on the monitor.
So I'd like to give thanks to the universe for every single,
Oh, hell no, hell no.
for every single word you say.
that I get to live.
Praise Bob and hail Connie.
By God, there's at least seven minutes left of this life.
This little life captured forever on the spinning disks and reels.
So much more permanent than you or I.
We are but mayflies.
A passive shadow.
Perhaps just as we examine and pity and laugh at the little mayfly
in its best interest.

brief span, perhaps some larger creature is gazing upon us.
Perhaps our little world is but an aquarium.
And you are nailed to the door of perception, endlessly watching it swing open and shut.
Jesus came knocking, but no one answered.
It's more like Prometheus on the dock, waiting for the persecutor to let him be.
Buddha came knocking, and they hit him on the head with a stick.
Bob came a-knocking, but you didn't have your thirty dollars.
And he was too thick.
And so Bob was wroth and wrath in his anger.
And he yanked upon the rug and spread the banana peels.
And so many fell, and the bigger they fell.
Offer.
The harder Bob came, and his laugh rang out.
For political corruptigation.
From holiday to holiday.
And a very, very drastic disease in the body politic.
We thank our Lord Jesus, the fight-meister Lord, and his big shiny fangs.
For God has made us in his own image, and he's tired of looking in the mirror.
Bob, make up.
Make up your mind for the American people, why don't you?
And just step in and take over, won't you, Bob?
Hey.
Hey.
I want some cheesy poops, mother f***er.
Not that Bob.
Not Bob Grodds.
Bob Dobbs.
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
The living avatar of slack.
You crats from another dimension.
For our frop.
Our frankness.
Our frang.
And our fang-eye.
Our fang.
And other things.
Our fang?
That the listener does not know.
Let's go into the void.
For all of you to decrease.
Let go.
The many, many fools you have.
Float downstream, dude.
Black is the color and none is the number.
Turn off your mind, relax.
Void, void, void.
Anything that makes it harder to pee is anti-slack.
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1959.
I believe it.
Prunes are God's answer to man's every dilemma.
Anything that makes it harder to learn is also anti-slack.
Reverend Ivan Stang, 2000.
We can only offer our Sinjurish thanks for that.
So turn off that TV and turn up your radio and read a book every now and then.
Foo!
How come Danny P. Chagas isn't saying anything?
He doesn't.
Show his face.
Either he's cowering down there.
Or maybe he's not.
His microphone is muted.
Danny P. Chagas, unmute your microphone.
Mute type, man.
Mute type.
Unmute now.
Uncover.
Mutant.
I don't think he's really there.
I think he's out like at the 7-Eleven getting some milk.
He's rummaging through the refrigerator at the moment.
Oh, here he is.
He unmuted.
I think.
Fuck you, motherfucker.
Look, guys.
Here he is.
Paul just messaged me.
Like, you want me to add you to the panel?
I responded.
Give me a minute.
I got it.
I just woke up.
I got to do some stuff.
And then I hear him in here.
Like, he's not responding.
I'll just add him anyways.
Like, ah, heck.
I like your boogaloo stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, I'm not letting the fascists take my fashion away from me.
So you're a pro-fat in the boogaloo big luau movement?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Big luau.
Nothing.
Is there a big luau now?
Look, if these guys, they wear Hawaiian shirts.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
They do wear Hawaiian shirts.
I saw a picture of that.
That makes you a boogaloo boy, right?
Yeah.
Yes, exactly.
You're probably a boogaloo idiot.
Look, if wearing these shirts is going to get people to think that I'm some idiot who goes
around carrying an AR-15 at protests, and if I have to start carrying an AR-15 to defend
myself against people who mistake me for them, then that's what it's going to do.
Because I'm not buying.
Different shirts.
Are you willing to shoot them first before they shoot you?
I'd have to.
I don't want to.
You carry it, but there's always somebody who's going to be less inhibited than you,
just about.
I'm going to get an AR-30 because it's twice an AR-15.
It's twice as long and twice as wide.
Twice as many bullets.
Duck take them together.
Yep.
And an AR-45.
A mounting automatic rifle.
Just big round.
A little dwarfish assistant to carry it or help carry it.
AR-450.
I don't have ammunition for mine.
That's a problem that I can't buy it here in libtard California.
That's funny.
You should have a gun in California.
I'm without ammunition.
I wonder what they make.
They got rid of it.
They outlawed them in California, so you're safe.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, under 15 years ago, maybe longer.
You have to go out of state to get ammo.
Well, you have to go into the Indian Empire, definitely.
Yeah, well, all the guns are gone.
You don't have to worry about it anymore.
Well, the guns are around, but you need the ammunition.
It has to be the right size.
You know, I even have silver bullets.
Really?
In case a werewolf...
Yes, they're right here.
Where are they?
I only have four.
Four?
They're not very good.
They're of a too small gauge.
They would kill your werewolf, but by the time they did, your werewolf would have killed
you many times over.
If you don't have any silver bullets, you can kill a werewolf.
I have these little neighbor kids, and they're four and five, and their favorite show is
about zombies and werewolves, and they're always chattering about, yeah, I want to be
one of the werewolves, but he wants to be one of the zombies, and I think we're just
there.
The cartridge case is brass, but the bullet part is silver, and the problem with firing
a silver bullet is...
You have to be about six feet from your werewolf because the silver melts.
The bullet tends to tumble in flight.
It is not accurate.
And if you're six feet away...
See, they don't bring these details in the movies.
They don't do their research.
And this is a...
They don't, because you could just cut a werewolf's head off and save your silver.
Or a .22, which is...
You want a larger bullet to take the...
No, don't count .22.
I'm going to take my chances.
I'm going to take my chances with a knife and cut a werewolf's head off if he attacks
me.
Chainsaw.
Silver chainsaw.
I got a silver chainsaw.
A silver toothed chainsaw.
Here's some of the consecrated host.
This, of course, is for anti-vampire protection.
What the hell is that?
That blackened stuff in there?
What is that?
Oh, it's technically the blood of Christ.
Holy...
Well, yeah, it's the blood of somebody.
Where did you get that?
I don't know.
I forget.
This bread I break was once the oat, this wine upon a foreign tree.
Any Catholic can get that stuff.
I was going to say, is that consecrated wine?
Yes, it is.
Oh, I see.
It's wine that...
It's transubstantiated.
It's wine...
Oh, I see.
No, it's blood.
It looks just like blood.
Thanks to transubstantiation.
Come on.
People have been burned alive for mentioning the wrong difference.
It is, according to doctrine, the transubstantiated blood.
It's the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Is that phyllo?
That's a universal antidote.
That's what it's like.
That's not the vapor of encouragement, is it?
If you get poisoned, this'll save you.
I would have had me...
If you get snake bit, this'll save you.
What will it save you from?
The chicken John threw most of them away.
Whatever it needs to.
Libertarians.
Is that cyanide or something?
The cyanide comes just before 7 a.m. on July 15th.














Everyone gets a capsule and drinks Freulein Braun.
And we will fly to the...
Freitag von Loringhoven.
The comet.
We will fly together to the comet.
We will cut off our testicles into the bucket and fly together to the comet.
The last testicle of the movement.
If you had some money, what would you do with it?
How would you use it?
I'd buy more of these bandanas.
Buy gold.
We have to get one of those bandanas, Mickey.
Oh, Ned, you know very well what to do with money.
You send it to Bob, of course.
Sell gold.
Buy gold.
Deliver it to the people.
Sell gold with it.
Actually, the coronavirus has been really good for the church business.
Really?
Strangely enough.
Really?
Because people are stuck at home and so they're so desperate.
Bob's looking out for you.
He's looking for slack.
He's looking for slack.
He's like, you know, Stang could use a little help.
I got this prayer cloth.
I guess that Reverend Stang prayed over it.
Maybe that'll make it better.
I breathe.
I put on every one of these bandanas and breathe through it.
A prayer cloth?
Isn't it a shame that televangelists are waiting for the coronavirus to pass?
And the quarantine to be over so that they can get back to healing the sick?
That's got to be humility.
It's a strange world anyway now.
The world gets a little stranger every day.
Because we slipped in in 2016.
We slipped into an alternate universe.
And now it's like getting more and more alternate.
It's alternating more and more.
That's how you do it, Stang.
Slipping more and more off kilter.
That way you let Bob see for you.
You don't need your eyes.
As long as you got the eyes of Bob.
Some wise guy sent us a picture of himself doing that.
He was behind the wheel of a car.
Oh.
That's kind of...
How long are we going to go tonight?
I'll see what I need.
There's a reason why they call it subgenius.
Hey, it works.
He survived long enough to send you the picture.
Yeah.
That's an endorsement right there.
You can put that on the website.
Blanked the illegal disclaimer.
I'm going to go to the trash.
Missing the shot.
Missing the money.
I'll see you at my buttocks, Bob.
Which is also subgenius.
I should get an extra one of those used for like a cloth toilet paper thing.
You can only easily transition into an alternate universe that is almost like this universe.
That has only a few slides.
Yeah, you wouldn't know.
You wouldn't know necessarily.
But from that point, you could start with another one.
And there is a phenomenon where there's a cascade.
Where you simply start moving faster out of this.
Into variant universes.
I hate when that happens.
It may be harder to get back.
I know.
It's like I've been trying to get back.
How do you un-cascade though?
You can't un-cascade.
You can't un-mute.
You can't un-cascade.
You can't un-mute.
That's where you tile.
You can't un-mute because you're a mutant.
Mutant.
We call them.
We can't un-mutate.
We can't un-cascade.
You can't go backwards.
You can evolve.
Yes, Owen.
One of my fears is that X-Day already happened.
And that at 7 a.m. on July 5, 1998, the entire universe disappeared.
And then was instantly replaced by one far stranger.
Well, remember, if we're in a simulation, it's not good to blow that scene.
Because then there's no reason for the simulation to continue.
And they'll turn it off.
So we have to believe in it for the time being.
You gotta believe.
Or you wake up and you're in some glass globe with the tube stuck in you and so on.
Will everybody clap if they believe in the...
Just keep a pipe, like a piece of pipe around you.
Yes, the pipe.
Yes, we...
Believe in reality.
Bring it back.
Come on, reality will die.
You don't...
Clap your hands.
Poor Tinkerbell.
She's been poisoned.
We gotta clap our hands.
I need to have a shoe or something.
They're not all ungulates.
They're like jellyfish horses.
You can't be ungulocentric, man.
Man, think of how it just like winds down to the wire until there's like only 15 planets with actual cowbells.
Uh-huh.
Or I don't know if it's 15, Chad knows the actual number.
But that's still...
Because he's been playing with himself with these things the last two weeks.
Man, any life at all is a beautiful miracle.
It takes billions of years for all those chemicals to...
Yeah, but isn't it odd that there are, you know, since we're kind of on Dada horse cowboys,
you know, like we're on them little rocking horses with the big garish faces and stuff,
just think of the ulterior worlds which surround us right at this proper moment, which probably
drift off these really...
Well, and you know, you guys...
These are not cowboy worlds where people have, you know, draw at the bar and stuff like that...
Yeah, there's a cop world.
...but they're wearing like business suits.
Not a business world, Jesus world.
Jesus world.
There's so many.
But you know what we're forgetting?
You know, it's not a mechanistic universe.
The world, life obviously is driven by some intelligence.
Evolution doesn't explain all of it.
And there must be an intelligence, and we can tell by the way things are that it must
be a cruel, vindictive, and rapacious...
R.
...intelligence, an implacable evil beyond any...
I don't see any R.
...with a sense of truth...
I don't see any R.
...any proof at all for any intelligence or anything.
I think all awareness is just a byproduct of the evolving brain adapting to its environment.
It's a little lone little baby boy.
It's a poor little thing, not a real baby boy, not a sexual being of any...
It's a poor little thing.
It's coming slowly, crawling on its nut.
And now it's...
Nah.
It's...
But because of the interconnectedness...
I could be wrong.
...of all life, that crawling thing is part of your life.

It's part of your brain, too.
Right.
And then, so naturally, that reflects Stang's view of the ultimate evil of this evolving
being.
Yes.
No, no, in that world there can be no good or evil in that view.
I think we're the mirror image of it, and we're basically good, and it's basically bad.
No, there is no good or evil.
There's just stuff people's does.
There is only the pipe and the smoker of the pipe.
Neither is...
All...
...good or evil as men know.
All...
...ussia, god, whatever.
...verbal, the mundane, the nanoward, ningún.
... şedem...
So, then we're all plural, and we're connected...




This real world is connected!
You are connected.
Oh!
I was going to tell this to myself.
Wait!
I do not know who you are, Stan, or if you're going to say SPANDI standing here.
No, not me, I am a man.
You are not a man but I am an animal being.
Oh...
So you are a human being, a mate, or is that also a human being, Atlanta?


Yes, you are an animal being.
Oh, what am i?
Listen to me, won't you listen to me?
When God is watching, we watch him back
We see right through his disguise
He tries to scare us with angry words
But we all know that they're lies
The world is waiting
Just see the fear in their eyes
The world is watching
We watch him back
He comes holding every move
Is it forgetting or the end?
Just like the chess game
But so intense
That I just don't understand
Anticipation
It's much too big to pretend
Wake up, it's 1984
Wake up, but we've been here

Wake up, it's 1984
Wake up, but we've been here before
Wake up, it's 1984
Big brother's screaming
But we don't care
Cause he's got nothing to say
Think of the future
Think of the prophecy
Think of the children of today
Big brother's marching
So we all stand in his way
Open your eyes
Look at the world
And see the signs
So walk away
All in your heart
Try to remember
Two worlds apart
It's all gone away
But to your angel as a planet
Here to see the light
Be a必�르� dwarf
We look back
But who doesn't notice
an answer
This is but a phase
In the cycle
Of space
My dream will never take no place
The calmness realize
But the dance
Is a gift
Yeah, I'm afraid

To be the one

That takes away

My trouble

When I have


Leading up to the slay
Watching the world
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Open your eyes
Surrounded by the new disguise
So far away
Open your eyes
Try to remember
Two worlds apart
But so far away
Wake up, it's 1984
Wake up, but we've been here before
Wake up, it's 1984
Wake up, but we've been here before
The world is watching
Anticipating
The big brothers marching
Losing forgetting
Losing forgetting
The world is turning
Losing 500

We've taken back
You can't think civilization
But portable
It's the journey
To the better
Doesn't remain
You mentioned
I've never seen
queria
Sentiment in my life
And now as you leave

interaction
Diddy Boy.
That's not what we've been
doing before.
Oingo Boingo did that.
And now this.
Dave, thanks to the heroic efforts
of the great Mr. Sister,
your butt has been
saved from a hanging.
Really?
Yep.
And it's hanging down in my car.
Really?
Yep.
Really?
It'll run.
Really?
Yeah, your butt runs again.
Really?
Thanks, Mr. Sister.
Fixed your butt.
Really?
He saved the wand over it.
He said there were cat hairs
all clustered around the...
Dig this, Dave.
There's tons of cat hairs here.
You're going to love this.
I just washed a bunch.
When you turned it on
and the DOS screen came up
and you thought everything
was messed up,
all you had to do was type
slash W-I-N
and then hit enter.
No, that didn't work.
That didn't work.
Oh, really?
No.
It worked for Mr. Sister
on your butt.
See, for Dave, it was spazzing.
No, it was not doing that.
It was saying
slip disc entry
of your boot vehicle
and stuff about your vertebrae.
It would not say
so you go
and then you go
W-I-N, enter.
No.
Maybe it just needed
to be carried around
in a car for a while.
Driven around
and wanted to go for a ride.
He had to visit to clean...
Maybe it was the cat hair.
Just needed to clean
the cat hair.
I had a four-track
reel-to-reel deck
that would only work
if you drove around with it
on bumpy roads
for about ten minutes.
Then it was fine.
That is a true thing.
Doesn't work anymore.
Some equipment
has possessed...
Maybe it was overheating
because the cat hair
was blocking the fan.
Well, that could be...
That's like practical...
I think it had
the Niels Bohr effect
or whatever they call it
when a scientist
looks at something
and the quantum physics
gets different.
So that's why...
Because he looked at it.
Yeah, and so now they...
The act of observing
changes it.
Yeah, so you had like
this retard looking at it
and maybe it was actually saying,
you know, whatever, you know,
and then...
That's a bunch of new age
gobbledygook days.
So I guess they posted...
Didn't I have
somebody else's rant here?
Put it in the...
Put it in the...
Put it in the...
Put it in the blue blazes.
Put it in the Sam Hill...
Oh, here it is.
This is from
a new subgenius,
or at least new to me,
or she,
I have no idea.
Reverend Longdead
Illuminati spy
sent...
this interesting statement
to the scrub genius group
on Google Groups.
That is members only.
In fact, you have to go through me
to get into it.
And this...
Reverend Longdead,
Illuminati spy,
said,
so far...
This is a little bullet list.
So far,
my leftist friends
have decided to start
buying up guns
in preparation
for a QAnon election attack.
Some pretend anarchists
have decided that
provoking a federal response
is the best way
to get Facebook likes.
President Trump
acted exactly
how we all knew
he would act
and sent in
federal officers
as his own
personal thugs.
Everyone is pretending
all the abuses of power
aren't from the WTO
protest playbook
and are a brand new thing.
So far,
also,
having the audacity
to point out
that most attempts
at Marxism
have resulted
in more oppressive societies
gets you labeled
a fascist.
Meanwhile,
protests around
legitimate problems
in the U.S.
are getting drowned out
because middle class kids
just want to vent
their unfocused anger.
The founders
of the national level
Black Lives Matter movement
want Mao-style culture
to be a cultural revolution
but have changed
every instance of
class in Marxist theory
to race.
So far,
no one is acting
the slightest rationality
on either side.
Only emotion
and embellished storytelling
are ruling the day.
Meanwhile,
Reverend Longdeck says,
we actually need
to
to get some

can take
dill

seriously.
To this end,
I canld
if you
ever
do
this
thing
here,
I'm
down
the descub
if everything
but for anyone in their 20s and younger.
Serious education around civics and critical thinking.
Good luck on that one.
And finally, for the left,
to quit thinking they can only focus on one thing at a time
and to realize you don't need ideological purity.
But screw all that.
You can't tribalize and feel superior over easily identified others.
So let's ignore those things.
Instead, let's focus on categories we've already tried to establish are arbitrary
and then split into factions over those.
That'll show them.
So, I thought that was reasonable from a subgenius.
Price Bob, and now this.
I am.
What is Dobstown?
What is, then, Dobstown?
It is the stuff that dreams are made of.
It's what makes Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys fly.
It powers the Starship Enterprise.
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS.
Though not yet available in Linux.
It's the general oblivion created when the moon dance strikes the cornea of your head.
Dobstown.
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, pukey habit.
It's the drug that helps you find God.
It's the lonely night before it never, never ends.
Dobstown.
It is your brain on drugs.
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave.
It's where there is a lake in which results...
It is the sword excalibur kept by the lady of the lake, Connie Dobbs.
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of that sword out of that lake,
it's easier to pull a fig from a donkey's anus.
Dobstown.
It is where all the flowers have gone.
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis.
Dobstown.
It is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, smothered with sauteed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy.
Mmmmm.
Dobstown.
It is John Dillinger's penis, savaged in muscular gravy and surrounded by mushroom people.
Dobstown.
The home of both Lemurians and Cenobites.
My proper home.
I'm going back someday.
I've got to get back to my home.
Dobstown.
It's near the coast of Honalee and the land of Fredonia.
Dobstown.

Dobstown.
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, froth, and the green stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue.
Spiritual bliss with open-loam bowling every night from midnight to dawn.
Dobstown.
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, part of the year.
It's creamy and crunchy.
It tastes great and is less filling.
It is margarine and it is butter.
But if it were to fall into enemy hands, it would mean the destruction of us all.
Ah yes, Stang, but it is the downfall of us all.
And it tastes bad on bread because, man, those that go don't come back.
They're losers. Losers.
No, man, those who graduate from Dobstown come back changed.
In a new form.
You can't see them like you can see a man.
I don't see the others.
They don't move or talk.
Graduated like the chrysalis to the elf all the way up to a higher being.
They grow and grow.
Their tiny skin's hardly large enough to pop them as they begin expanding into that new form.
Dobstown!
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life.
They're the law.
Of course it's a law here.
Of course it's a law.
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules.
We need to have our lives governed by...
Dobstown!
It's where the bad little girls and boys go.
It's where something is happening all the time and most of it unsolved.
Some of it is so hard to locate.
Some of it is so hard to locate.

Many of the people from the Saucership Emblem itself have been sucked out and left here.
Dobstown.
I didn't want them to be oblique.
When they were strapped me down in a chair and started asking me questions about Dobstown,
I gave them literally a location but the website...
Dobstown.
It's Nwatsbaud spelled backwards.
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola, which are its slums.
And it has a ferry to Monster Island.
And what a delightful pair of individuals you'll never find there.
The ferries of Monster Island.
Tiny little happy people who do things for other people.
Who live for other people.
So big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature.
They can't get it.
Dobstown!
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends.
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around inside the earth for a while.
Yes, if you're waiting for another salubrious comment to someway illuminate that stupid passage.
Just read it again, Stang.
Just see what you just said.
What, the Dobstown is where the Tunguska meteorite came out?
After bouncing around inside the planet?
The Tunguska meteorite was, of course, as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave, was a miniature black hole.
Shot by Dobbs, the young ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs from his slingshot.
In a fit of rage?
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.
It was just, you know, he picked up a, other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot.
What would Bob pick up? A tiny black hole.
A pretzel.
A singularity.
A singularity.
A glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob.
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia.
And then past the event horizon, the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did, and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table.
Back and forth until finally it exited the earth.
And it exited at the place we now know as Dobbs Town.
Dobbs Town, friends.
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.
It's where you are better than you were in high school.
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted.
It was never a colony of France.
It is where science and magic are the same things.
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.
Wow.
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius.
It is the fizzling, crackling of new horizons for man.
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence.
It's where the early worm gets away.
It's where the gravediggers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.
Dobbs Town.
It's for when you're too lazy to kill yourself.
Dobbs Town.
Where there are no lawyers.
And where the government never tries to be helpful.
Dobbs Town, friends.
It's where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death.
Dobbs Town.
It's between the dark and daylight.
When the night is beginning to lower.
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.
Yeah, I feel you.
It's where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends.
You cannot think.
Dobbs Town.
You can only follow and listen.
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walk the earth.
The fabric is one thing like yourself.
One thread that could lead to thousands of other threads.
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together, squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stone so that you may not know the truth that we speak.
And yet here we are speaking it to you.
Dobbs Town is not a place where a man or woman dwells, but a place in the heart as big as that mighty elephant yoke.
And twice as tasty as all the trees.
That you could imagine.
Now imagination is not a place you want to stay.
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with.
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.
It's a place you visit over and over again.
With your pants on, your pants off, and your heart ripped right out hanging from your chest.
Dobbs Town.
Dobbs Town.
Where Bob comes home after an easy day's work.
And where you can come home too, friends.
Where you'll be home.
Where you'll finally realize why.
Why.
Why.
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dobbs Town when you join the Church of the Subgenius.
The world's only first, true, last, final...
I'd like you to stop.
...tapping me on the head with...
One true religion.
Because it admits it is full of crap.
It is paid for by the nuts.
It is the only one that's not full of crap!
...and the contrite.
And I know it's coming each time I can tell it.
You tell it.
Ah, ah, ah, go.
It's where Enio Morricone was delivered of his inspiration for this music in the background.
Huge, huge mandibles.
Large, large, fresh, gamy legs.
And now the matador Dobbs steps out before the enraged triceratops dinosaur.
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape in front of the maddened beast.
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground.
Dobbs grins. He smokes. The creature charges.
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by.
And after that...
It sits and pants like a little puppy dog.
From PR News in Washington, I'm forcing dozens of German auto executives in Glacier National Park to either reroute or hunker down in a Confederate country chalet.
Liberal activists say they're white nationalists in some art.
In opposition stronghold...
PR News, fire.
The owner of one of the world's largest amateur-built submarines announced...
This is PR News in Washington.
Thank you, Leimur.
And thank you, the participants of 23X Day on Zoom, as hosted by the good Professor Pressure.
Ah, yes.
Friends, I have some news.
The controversial Dr. Argus Fawkes has established a new subgenius network using the Discord program.
Or platform, I should say.
And it might well link everything subgeniously together in that futuristic way that I don't really understand.
The name of this network is Dobbs Chord.
And the secret key URL is...
Discord.subgeniuses.com
That's Discord.subgeniuses.com
Not subgenius.com.
Dr. Fawkes...
Most people mispronounce his name as Faux because of the way it's spelled.
Uh, but he's not French.
Uh, Dr. Fawkes wisely nabbed subgeniuses.com.
A while back.
Uh, the other new network, and it's much older, like a year older, is Dobbs.town.
Which is like Facebook for subgeniuses, but it's not on Facebook.
It's on Mastodon, so it's...
Less onerous.
It was founded by a doctor, uncle, onan cannabite, and he's the mayor of Dobbs.town.
You might want to check it out, although technically it's supposed to be for authorized subgenius ministers only.
As seen at subgenius.com.
Yeah, Dobbs.town.
That's the URL.
Friends, these are strange times, uh, that I sort of expected for much of my life, but not this way.
It's actually even more stupid than we expected.
WAY more stupid.
But, I guess that's the way of Jehovah One.
Uh, Bob can only continue to guide us through.
And we can only follow Bob's lead.
Yeah, I mean, even when he's blindfolded.
So praise Dobbs, and let there be slack.
At subgenius.com.
From PR News in Washington, I'm reporting.
Judge A. Wallace Tashima said both the enactment and enforcement of the statewide ban on PR studies were motivated by PR News.
On Wall Street 7221.
May 27, 824.
A photo released by North Korea suggests Pyongyang is working on more advanced PR News that could, in theory, reach parts of the U.S. mainland.
North Korean state media say this is PR News.
This is aéd Sage.
