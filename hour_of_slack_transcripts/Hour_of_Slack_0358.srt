1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:21,060
You know dear friends, there's nothing like being strapped by a big scrapping woman using her big red, red straps.

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:37,180
Or you know if you're feeling particularly bad and devilish, if you want the thrill of the forbidden, you might want to use those big green straps.

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:46,160
Oh, Bob wouldn't like that, now would he? But it would be so, so very bad. Yes.

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,460
What?

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,040
Yeah, you got all...

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,720
You got all the poison on this one.

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,820
You got all this crystal and this poison.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,640
Oh, Kevin.

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,700
Thank you.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
Hey, hey, hey.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,120
Y'all quit.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,480
No respect here.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,660
No, you can go ahead.

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,580
The paper was just harsh.

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,540
You don't get any more. I'm sorry.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,380
You're having a hard time.

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,620
It's all right.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,360
I've had it much fun.

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,720
The Magnum.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,480
Fun police.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,040
I don't lose.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,680
Can we see your fun license?

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,020
Take the ice pack.

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,440
Get the rubber sheets.

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,200
Take some heroin or some crack.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,760
Oh, hey, your crack filled my heroin.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,200
Your heroin filled my crack.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Well, did you crack all my heroin?

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,200
Your Tylenol filled my spider.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,980
I remember back when all you needed was a few hundred land mines, a Dobbs hat and a few dull thick headed lads to mend the barracks.

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,020


33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,880
And it was an easy time for a revolution.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,760
It was an easy time for a doctor back then.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,260
Ah, yes.

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,920
There was no end to the bones to saw clays.

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Yes, you could scam for the best of them back then.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,560
Sex hurts.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,440
Sex until it hurts.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm gonna tell you.

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,780
Sex hurts.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,100
Speak to us, Trinita.

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,660
Sex hurts.

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,540
Sex hurts.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,260
Sex hurts.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,700
Sex hurts.

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,880
Sex hurts.

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,260
Sex hurts.

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,140
Sex hurts.

50
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:32,720
Sex hurts and hemorrhoids are two different things!

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,420
Don't you know this is where your bad days are?

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:49,640
Don't you know this is where your bad days are?

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:49,920
Now

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,840
That's where the nanny made it

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,120
Now

56
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,200
And now

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,520
You won't have to wonder

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,900
When the ghosts are to stay

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:03,660
Ooh

60
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,680
You're looking at

61
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
The torch that you're in

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:09,780
Underwear

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,600
Excuse the man

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,720
I'ma really make a party

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,060
Well, I've been to the room

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,500
Because I'm dancing with a

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,740
Ladies and gentlemen

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,700
May I have your attention, please

69
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,180
When we leave this area

70
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,700
In a moment

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,060
Be sure to take along all your belongings

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Including your imagination

73
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,420
Kill Bob

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
I know what you want

75
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,700
You want to kill Bob

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,320
You want to kill me

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,180
Oh

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,560
What about Slack

79
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,680
That's your key phrase

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
It will trigger the entire message

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,620
Without your being aware of it

82
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,640
And now

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,800
The Self Genius

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,340
Hour of Slack

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,100
Ahhhhhhh

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,040
Ahhhhhh

87
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,040


88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,020
Ahh

89
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,700
Ahhh

90
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,700


91
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,700


92
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,700


93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,060
Years ago

94
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,860
I started out broke washing dishes

95
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,940
And got promoted to be a bus boy

96
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,420
To support ten brothers and sisters

97
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,280
And a mom and a dad

98
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,540
Things are different now

99
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,220
I credit the whole thing

100
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,440
To Bob

101
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,000
B-O-B, B-O-B, B-O-B, B-O-B.

102
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, I know you're not used to seeing me without my partner, Bob.

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Bob is in jail, and he's doing quite well.

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,540
Been to the Betty Ford Clinic. He's different now.

105
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,800
Imagine that. You kill your whole family just because the devil tells you, you know?

106
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,500
Then afterwards, you go back to the devil and you go,

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,760
Yes, devil, I did as you instructed. I killed my family.

108
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,960
And then I chopped them up and put them in a duffel bag.

109
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,040
Here they are in a duffel bag.

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,560
I'll be burying them tonight at the shallow grave by the side of the railroad track.

111
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,260
As you have commanded, O Lord, host of the hoary netherworld.

112
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,420
Then the devil pulls off a mask.

113
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,220
It's me, Bob!

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:39,800
It's me, Bob!

115
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,160
Bob works in mysterious ways.

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,580
You can tell it's a spirit-filled revival.

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,340
But when the stage looks like this.

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Blood, broken cameras.

119
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,980
Man, if I really wanted to do time control, I'd smash my radio show here.

120
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,700
Oh, and there goes the radio show.

121
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,480
But that's okay, because welcome, dear friends.

122
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,680
This is Hour of Silence.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,500
Slack number 358.

124
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,400
The Subcon special.

125
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,580
Because last week was the Intergalactic Subgenius Convention in Chicago.

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,040
Sponsored by the Pope of Chicago, Michael Flores.

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,900
And Uberdominatrix, Pam Smith.

128
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,180
And although we have gotten a lot of excellent audio contributions from all over the place.

129
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,580
Whoa!

130
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,320
This month.

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,760
We're going to stick to tapes of that Subcon tonight.

132
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,740
Oh, yes, because I think everybody had a lot of fun at the Subcon.

133
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,300
But I know that I, I had more fun than anybody else.

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,160
It was a total all-slack gut blowout.

135
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,880
Just as promised.

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,220
It wasn't a real big crowd.

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,280
Maybe a hundred subgenius diehards.

138
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
But they came from all over.

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,800
There was one guy even from England.

140
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,080
And a bunch of people from Houston.

141
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,780
And from LA.

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,180
And Brian Anderson.

143
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,500
And friends from ZXQ Universe in Minneapolis.

144
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,800
And I couldn't believe it.

145
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,960
An Hour of Slack fan from Dallas actually thought it might be worth it.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,380
Reverend Andrew Baggett.

147
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,240
It was so, so nice to see a familiar face there.

148
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,280
And I'll bet he'll testify that you.

149
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,260
That is, I'll bet he'll testify that you.

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,260


151
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,980
That is all the rest of you out there listening.

152
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,760
You really screwed up.

153
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,960
Because although it wasn't a big crowd, friends.

154
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,420
It was in some ways the greatest subgenius revival ever.

155
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,820
Mainly because of the unique combination of the swinging love corpses.

156
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,460
And Sister Mary squared.

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Au contraire.

158
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,740
A hot, hot combo.

159
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,340
And it was hot in that bar that the devivals were in.

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,240
So we all had to shed as many clothes as possible.

161
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:30,220
Sister Mary, Sister Terry Terry, and me, and many other people all ended up performing in our underwear.

162
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,860
So it was visually arresting.

163
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,060
When I looked at the video, I couldn't believe it.

164
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,760
Four babe preachers, dear friends.

165
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,300
It did not look like the subgenius devivals of the past.

166
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
In fact, I would go on.

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,520
I would venture to say that the new subgeniuses are getting a vastly different impression of the church than in the old days.

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,840
Do you dare to wear your underwear on your head?

169
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,320
As Father Joe Mama has exhorted you.

170
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,560
Well, Sister Mary squared did.

171
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
And I would have.

172
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,640
I meant to.

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,400
But I forgot.

174
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,160
But it wasn't all devival.

175
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,340
There was this little theater in the trashy part of town.

176
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,220
Where most of the schmoozing and many rants and the video acid test took place.

177
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,600
Called the Prop Theater.

178
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,300
Which very shortly gained the new appellation of Frop Theater.

179
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,760
In fact, we changed the sign outside to say that.

180
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
Because that's just what it was.

181
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,200
When you first entered, the authorities in charge informed you.

182
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, you can do soft drugs like pot and acid up front in the lobby in the theater.

183
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,300
But if you want to do crack or shoot up heroin or coke, you have to go to the backstage area.

184
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,880
Sorry, sorry, that's just our policy.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
We had William Burroughs in here last month.

186
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,000
And the band that was with him was all young heroin addicts.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,120
And one of the patrons walked into the girls' restroom and caught this kid shooting up in his butt.

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,040
So, I'm sorry we have to be so strict about it.

189
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,580
Hard drugs in the back only.

190
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,520
Now, despite this amount of permissiveness, dear friends.

191
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,040
I never saw any subgenius doing hard drugs.

192
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:28,340
Except for the terrible amounts of free beer that Pope Flores supplied.

193
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,580
A lot of free beer.

194
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,740
And no soft drugs either.

195
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,140
There was Frop, of course.

196
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,760
There was the various different kinds.

197
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,060
There was the Jesus Heroin Frop.

198
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,380
And the Buddha Amphetamine Frop.

199
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,660
The Jim Jones Cyanide Frop.

200
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,580
The Lobsang Rampa Cyril Hoskins Placebo Frop.

201
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,900
The Rasputin Hashishin Frop.

202
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,620
The Naked Desert Radioactive Undying Frop.

203
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,220
The Negi Toxic Waste Crack Frop.

204
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,520
The Outcast Bedouin Spore Frop.

205
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,600
So much Frop that we were squeezing it out of our lungs.

206
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,700
People were doing Stang Lung and Cleave Liver and Wellman Brow.

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,520
Which is like doing 40 Jane-er Tons in 10 minutes with the digital delay set on Bold Surrealist.

208
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,440
And the Sweat, God, and Pain knobs turned up to 10.

209
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:35,560
By the way, the God is measured on those knobs in ineffabilities.

210
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,800
That's what the little marks represent on that God knob.

211
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,720
Anyway, it was a party, dear friends.

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,900
We did what Bob said to do.

213
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,160
We did exactly what that man Bob said to do.

214
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,200
We had diamond cutters with shiny heads.

215
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,540
And the swinging meat Jesus was blessing us all the way on down the line.

216
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,280
We were, we warriors, dear friends.

217
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,540
We're dancing while proudly displaying our purpose.

218
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,540
We're dancing while celebrating our purpose.

219
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:07,540


220
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,180
That was the guys.

221
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,080
By the way, I should mention I see a lot of people recording our shows these days.

222
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,940
And most of them have much better tape decks than mine.

223
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,540
So if you go to a subgenius show and you have a good tape deck please send us copies.

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,040
Because your copies are better, probably better than our originals.

225
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,300
especially the love corpses and the watch smashing and the preacher babes oh

226
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,600
please oh please we can put such a wonderful little type together with that

227
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,360
so well I guess we'll just proceed on with these tapes and show oh I should

228
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,840
mention that princess we are doe graced the convention with her presence which

229
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,760
is a very electric presence because her princess we are doe uniform is sort of

230
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:20,120
like a space Viking Queen all lined and and livid with glow sticks and all she

231
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,160
all she has to do is strut around a subgenius event proving herself queen of

232
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,300
all the UFOs not just the little silvery ones or the big cigar shake ones or the

233
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,820
amorphous blobby ones all of them

234
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:40,120
all of them dear friend for we you know on X Day she shall regain her powers and

235
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:48,180
her other helmet horn light will resume blinking and on that day you better hope

236
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,760
you're on her good side boys so anyway this show will be a lot of my

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,500
favorite subgenius stars might my new Shur Disevz actually old hurt her añ

238
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,800
Along for thevale by Derral blades

239
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:02,800


240
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:02,800


241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:16,420
Swinging Love Corpses Live, Sister Mary Squared, Au Contrere, and G. Gordon Gordon, the amazing G. Gordon Gordon, on the panel discussion, the conspiracy panel discussion.

242
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,620
You'll hear quite a bit of us discussing various conspiracies and levels of conspiracies.

243
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:31,900
And, of course, you know, I couldn't do a show without starring yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

244
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:40,480
And, of course, Joe Riley's lovely media barrage cuts as transitions.

245
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,360
Ah, yes.

246
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,120
The best song that we do.

247
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,560
Song number one, song number two.

248
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
The best song that we do.

249
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

250
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,540
Oh, pretty baby.

251
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:30,360
Oh, pretty baby.

252
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

253
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,780
It's the best song.

254
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,260
It's the best song you want to sing.

255
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:40,880
We want it to hit you.

256
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,860
We want it to hit you.

257
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,140
We want it to hit you.

258
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,900
We want it to hit you.

259
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,320
We want it to hit you.

260
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,480
We want it to hit you.

261
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,420
We want it to hit you.

262
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,420


263
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,580
We want it to hit you.

264
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,700
Oh, pretty baby.

265
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:46,740
It's the best song.

266
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:46,760
It's the best song.

267
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,040
It's the best song.

268
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,660
It's the best song.

269
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,100
We want it to hit you.

270
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,420
We'd like to do that one first, just to get it out of the way.

271
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:01,880
We'd like to do that one first, just to get it out of the way.

272
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:31,880
We'd like to do that one first, just to get it out of the way.

273
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:47,080
We'd like to do that one first, just to get it out of the way.

274
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,920
We're all grown, we're all grown up men.

275
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,100
We're all past the age of reasoning.

276
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,960
We're all past the age of reasoning.

277
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,040
It is our time.

278
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,840
Long be us.

279
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,860
Yet you still ask.

280
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,220
We are going to save the universe.

281
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,280
We are going to save the universe.

282
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,220
We are going to save the universe.

283
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,380
Wow!

284
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,280
Yes, I am!

285
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,120
Oh, come on, we've done it!

286
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:51,540
Huh, it's all right now, we're going to save the universe.

287
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:51,580
We're going to save the universe.

288
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:51,580


289
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,440
Why do we still want this world to go on and on and on?

290
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,680
We have the results, just don't forget, don't worry!

291
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:55,740
Show us!

292
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,060
And no.

293
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,860
Oh, without front teeth no one is.

294
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,240
We don't deserve to leave, we feature not for us, we are too far.

295
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,220
guitar solo

296
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,720
guitar solo

297
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,080
Don't you worry

298
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,020
Don't have no fear

299
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,040
Don't get up tight

300
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,060
Because the end is near

301
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,980
We can't fail

302
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,800
We must learn

303
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,760
We must learn

304
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,940
We are more than a band

305
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,600
We are going to save the universe

306
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,520
We are going to save the universe

307
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,500
We are going to save the universe

308
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,040
This time!

309
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,580
This time!

310
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,080
In a little Ziploc baggie

311
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,140
In a little Ziploc baggie

312
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,340
In the whole universe

313
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,780
We got it all saved

314
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,800
We got it all saved

315
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,240
Down on your knees

316
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm a stock genius

317
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't have to paint this grass

318
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm a stock genius

319
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,300
I don't have to paint this grass

320
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,340
I am saved

321
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,760
I am saved

322
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,720
I am saved

323
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:54,840
I am saved

324
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,660
I am saved

325
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,000
Gave that air ball

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hail Cognac

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hail Cognac

328
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,520
Hail Cognac

329
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,720
Hail Cognac

330
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,180
He may be dumb, but God he is cute

331
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,220
Praise God

332
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,540
Praise God

333
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, it's a real pleasure to be here

334
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
I ah, I've been looking forward to this

335
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,920
having been in the church too long

336
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,560
I discovered the church about a year ago

337
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,760
and I thought, first things first

338
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,140
you get to know me a little

339
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,480
I hope to get to know some of you a little

340
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,740
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

341
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,820
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

342
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,820
I know you're pushing shop and it's lucky fun, but you might just be lucky.

343
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,800
And hey, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

344
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,480
So I thought I'd tell you how I came to find the Church of the Subgenius

345
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:46,280
and introduce you to the other priestesses and priests that are among the audience today that I came up with

346
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,620
and who brought me to the Church of the Subgenius.

347
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,820
I did not know Bob.

348
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,480
I had no idea who Bob was.

349
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,300
Yet when I was little, I felt as though I was from another planet,

350
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
as if I had been put down into this body.

351
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,220
And somehow I wasn't like the rest of the people out there.

352
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,740
They were weird.

353
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,260
You couldn't talk too loud because you might hear the people come off.

354
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,340
And you couldn't walk too proud because then they'd realize.

355
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,060
That's right.

356
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,480
I'm a woman.

357
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,800
That's right.

358
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm not just a woman.

359
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm a wall man.

360
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm a sister of the Yeti and I am proud to be a member of this church.

361
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,740
But I wasn't always this proud.

362
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,540
Before I met Bob and before I hailed Connie, I was deprived of my individual freedom.

363
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,440
I was sick.

364
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
It was.

365
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,520
I was a member of the.

366
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,180
I was a member of the Yeti cult.

367
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,360
I beat myself into unconsciousness.

368
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,900
Stick me in the third eye.

369
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,660
I am dumb.

370
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,780
Tried all kinds of religions.

371
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,460
Tried all kinds of ways.

372
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,580
And the only thing I could find was a power game.

373
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,260
Tell it.

374
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,860
A name that I didn't know the meaning of yet.

375
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,660
But somehow deep inside my soul I knew it was mine.

376
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,740
Because my mind bent and twisted and turned and went in ways that no one could possibly dream of.

377
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,360
So I was merry, merry.

378
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,900
on the contrary but no, Bob, dammit, that was too easy.

379
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,020
So I became Mary squared, all

380
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,640
contrary. Tell it, sister.

381
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,420
Mary to the second power, on the contrary.

382
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,020
The virgin and the whore all rolled into one.

383
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,280
Praise the ovary man.

384
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,300
I found Bob, I found

385
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,980
Bob, and I found Connie, and Bob

386
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,220
introduced me to the church. I had my first religious experience in the church

387
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,960
with Bob. Praise Bob. And along with Bob I found

388
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,000
the pagans and the witches and the beat-dickin'

389
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,160
semi-deities that walk and talk among us today.

390
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,720
I enjoyed that ride. It was the jerks that got me.

391
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,120
I got to break this conspiracy. What I have here is a photograph

392
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,440
of a UFO being tested by Nazi officers

393
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,380
in World War II.

394
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:40,240
I attended the UFO Congress in West Berlin. I've been living there for

395
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,280
17 years and I'm also the sole representative of the Church of the Subgenius in West Berlin.

396
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,240
And I attended this UFO Congress and there was a speaker there whose main subject

397
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,180
was extraterrestrial conspiracies on his planet. And he claimed that the

398
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,160
Nazis were the first. Well, he could probably go back thousands of years,

399
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,140
but as far as our history is concerned, the Nazis were the first to actually make a deal with

400
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,060
the graves and that they had this souped-up technology in exchange for human lives

401
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,300
which they needed to experiment with. This is proof. Jews. That's what the Jews were.

402
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,220
And that's one reason why when the U.S. won

403
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,960
World War II, they hired all of the main

404
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,940
Nazi intelligence people and scientists. Thank you very much.

405
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,540
Yes, thank you.

406
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,960
We have found that there are certain

407
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,160
forms of a very advanced technology which involve

408
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,740
energizing with forces that we don't normally associate with

409
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,680
energizing machinery or equipment. They have found that the

410
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,200
sudden dissipation of the life force out of the human body

411
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,760
can be used for various other means.

412
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,440
And this is part of the really big conspiracy that I love to hate.

413
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,960
Basically, you must envision the universe as a food chain

414
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,240
in which different levels of energy are consumed by more

415
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,960
advanced forms that eat the forms below them.

416
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,960
Whether it's animals eating grass, carnivores eating meat,

417
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,040
animals merely absorbing liquids. But there is also a whole

418
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,100
spectrum of energy, the psychic spectrum, which can be used

419
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,640
for energy forces. The Aztecs had found this out.

420
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,160
The release of human life through massive, massive ritual sacrifice

421
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,700
can provide an energy level release that will power

422
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,880
technology, that will power psychic technology. The Nazis were

423
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,040
working on the same project. And this is the same project that is even

424
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,920
to this very day being experimented on in certain levels in parts of

425
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,660
Central America, in Guatemala, in Costa Rica, where these guerrilla

426
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,620
forces supposedly clash with government forces and bodies are

427
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,240
left behind. It is not a war for land. It is not a war for territory.

428
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,440
The universe right now is a war for energy. The energy resources

429
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
of our universe are limited. The life forces are varied and exist

430
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,160
on enormously different levels. And I want to tell you that we are

431
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,900
about way down in the bottom of the food chain in the world.

432
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,940
We are in the galaxy. And the things that we really should be

433
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,880
talking about is not the cheap bullet of politics here on Earth,

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,560
because it doesn't matter. What we should be thinking about is the

435
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,080
things that threaten us from the outside, the things that manifest

436
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,320
themselves as old flying saucers or super sonic creatures from

437
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:33,660
Hollywood or Jim Jones or anything like that. The point is that there

438
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,240
are a lot more scary things out there than George Bush or Bill Clinton

439
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,900
or Ross Gay.

440
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,740
Or Ross Perot or Saddam Hussein or Bob Dobbs for that matter.

441
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:50,400
Human anguish is a very high priced drug among the elder gods.

442
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,740
The elder gods will pay top dollar for the right quality of human anguish.

443
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,080
John

444
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,520
Johnson

445
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,260
bone.

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Basically,

447
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,900
it's because he has a lot of natural Antarctic evenly.

448
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:38,900


449
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
The week was very wild

450
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,420
Stay inside I open the door

451
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
See the cobblers in the corner there's dust on the floor

452
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,500
We close the door the boy has a bonner

453
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,260
It's our house, six to the bonner

454
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,900
It's the hideous house where we belong

455
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:32,360
You can never leave

456
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,160
Things going on but you can't believe

457
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,360
Down in the desert you can hear the scream

458
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,280
Ready to wake like a bad dream

459
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,880
But what you see is no illusion

460
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,460
You can only draw one conclusion

461
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,480
I think the truth is they don't die

462
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,520
Thinking like a star when you leave your life

463
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,440
It is how, man, where we can be found

464
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,980
It's a hellish house, it's a whole dream

465
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,040
It's a hellish house

466
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,920
It's a hellish house

467
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,320
It's a hellish house

468
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,800
It's a hellish house

469
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:57,900
Woo! Woo!

470
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
Whoo!

471
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,640
Whoo!

472
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,100
Whoo!

473
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,840
Whoo!

474
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,960
Whoo!

475
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,520
Whoo!

476
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:35,900
Whoo!

477
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,720
Whoo!

478
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,100
Whoo!

479
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,440
Whoo!

480
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,440
You can never leave

481
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,540
There's things going on that you can't believe

482
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,840
You'll adore the floor and the fauna

483
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,920
To us our house is next to Nirvana

484
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,380
Home to the strong man, music to sing

485
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Go on, make the go to the wall of this city

486
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,040
I speak to you, man, take your time

487
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,720
Make it like a song, you'll be alive

488
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,960
It's a heady ass house, it's well and good and all

489
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,900
It's a heady ass house, it's well and good and all

490
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:52,900


491
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,840
It's a heady ass house, it's a home sweet home

492
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,660
It's a heady ass house, it's where we belong

493
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,840
It's a heady ass house, it's a home sweet home

494
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,040
It's a heady ass house, it's where we belong

495
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,580
It's a heady ass house, it's where we belong

496
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,680
It's a heady ass house, it's a home sweet home

497
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,380
It's a heady ass house

498
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,500
It's a heady ass house

499
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
Hey, turn this guy around.

500
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,900
Turn this guy around next time.

501
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,480
I want to see his back popping like that on this side.

502
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,640
Turn around the next song so we can enjoy your lively antics there.

503
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,860
This audience member with the double-jointed shoulder blade.

504
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,520
Wow.

505
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,480
Seriously double-jointed.

506
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,540
Bizarre-looking mutant.

507
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,760
Great dancer.

508
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,180
I never saw a shoulder blade man before, you know.

509
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,680
That's kind of a new one.

510
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,380
Hey, but wait a minute.

511
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,840
You need to punch that big zit you got on your back, though.

512
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
This really looks bad.

513
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,520
It's a really nasty white one back there.

514
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,260
Ah, just kidding.

515
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,780
We better get back because it will be dark soon and they mostly come at night.

516
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,960
Mostly.

517
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,320
I need your money as a dwelling place while I am here on your earth.

518
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Where do you put it?

519
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,140
You got a hollow leg?

520
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,480
It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.

521
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,960
And you must stand united on this and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.

522
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:42,080
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.

523
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,860
The point is, as Charles Ford said, we are property.

524
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,620
And the free rent control days.

525
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,380
The early universe are over.

526
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,000
And what it boils down to is, is this planet a paying proposition for the exes?

527
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,460
Can there be something of value?

528
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,820
Otherwise, should we just render it down?

529
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,680
And Bob is the person who can negotiate the difference.

530
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,980
As I said, it's either a hell stuck ease on some side of the intergalactic highway,

531
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,240
or perhaps it is a little green planet of the clocks where the souls of subgeniuses are farmed

532
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,940
and ecologically conserved to feed the elderly.

533
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,560
And the only way to do that is to make the gods of the earth and the gods of the earth

534
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,180
on a rational, slow basis.

535
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,400
Earth farm one is what we live on.

536
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,500
That's what the exes call it.

537
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,800
And that's the best scenario.

538
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,420
Yeah, that's the best possible scenario.

539
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,920
We're not even talking about worst possible.

540
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,160
Worst possible?

541
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
No, stupid law of the earth.

542
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,340
Well, the worst possible is if the Yakutism end up with us.

543
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,040
In which case?

544
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,120
I'd like to mention one of my favorite conspiracy theories.

545
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,340
Yeah.

546
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:56,220
And you know, conspiracies always imply, oh howdy y'all, conspiracies always imply that

547
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,800
it's secret knowledge.

548
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:06,940
So let's lay to rest a conspiracy theory that has become as popular as smiley faces.

549
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,600
JFK.

550
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,680
JFK.

551
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,820
I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

552
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,760
Yeah!

553
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,420
Which Lee Harvey Oswald?

554
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:29,880
Six foot two blonde Lee Harvey Oswald who walks over to the Russian Embassy in Mexico City.

555
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,680
Five foot ten Lee Harvey Oswald.

556
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,700
Or was it the Lee Harvey Oswald with the backboard shadows?

557
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,320
Okay, one of the three.

558
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


559
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,640
One of the Lee Harvey Oswalds acted alone.

560
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,480
That's a good way to sum up the Kennedy assassination in one sentence.

561
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,680
One of the Lee Harvey Oswalds acted alone.

562
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,380
No doubt many of you do not believe that these things do happen.

563
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,420
But they cannot happen to you.

564
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,060
You may also believe that the facts have been exaggerated.

565
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,800
Let me tell you of something that happened right here in our own city.

566
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,720
All my indicator lights are green.

567
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,960
Watch what you're doing.

568
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,460
We saw a flying saucer come down.

569
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,420
You know, like on the TV.

570
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,520
Can this be the threshold of inner space?

571
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,200
Ladies and gentlemen, this is our McDonnell Douglas Mission Control Room at Disneyland

572
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Spaceport.

573
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,040
The Director of Operations has been expecting you.

574
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,980
And while we're waiting for our flight to be called, he'll take a few minutes to describe

575
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,920
what's going on.

576
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,600
At the side post up ahead, your next stop.

577
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,700
You're next.

578
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:46,700


579
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:46,700


580
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,760
BOBS..........

581
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:47,760


582
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,400
Bog-bob's place.

583
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,780
I have too much yay in me.

584
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:31,400
There are many things in this crazed and confused world today.

585
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,820
Confusion is rampant in the minds of us men, or rather women.

586
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,420
In fact, while one person is swearing to one way of life,

587
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:55,060
another set of ideas entirely separate may be swimming around in that person's head.

588
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:05,280
Why, even in our own church, yes, even here, there are those among us who profess to be subgenius.

589
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,020
They even act like us,

590
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,400
but

591
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,220
oh,

592
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,120
au contraire.

593
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:24,520
Inside their blank and confused little minds, there are time and order.

594
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,460
They are the ones who are the most

595
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,500
Well, mankind's knowledge and woman kind too,

596
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,760
with your bottom lines how many people you through.

597
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,060
Working your way to the head of the path,

598
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,420
by cheating, deceiving, and making a class.

599
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,880
There are just a lot of people who think like you,

600
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,080
who want a jatuzzi and a room with a view.

601
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,560
Who act like stupid and makes you feel black,

602
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,860
and big tips and a douche look black.

603
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,220
Of course you're a sester and your man's won't clunk,

604
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,500
as long as she puts out, you come home drunk.

605
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,960
She thinks you're garbage and you think she's scum,

606
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,020
you'll both be content if your man's a cop.

607
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,660
Music

608
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,700
Whoa!

609
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,860
Boy, that was a good one.

610
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,800
Boy, the end of tape comes quick there.

611
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,780
You've been listening to Subgenius,

612
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,920
the world's Subgenius convention,

613
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,380
some recordings from there.

614
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,920
The Swinging Love Corpses is the band that we've been hearing

615
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,160
and will continue to hear.

616
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,780
And Sister Mary Square there preaching in her slip.

617
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,080
Oh, what a sight to see.

618
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,600
In a very hot, I mean, temperature-wise, hot club.

619
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,560
I think anybody who has followed the election

620
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,540
over the last year or so knows that for the first time in history,

621
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,020
the conspiracy has failed.

622
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,820
The conspiracy has put up the most odd,

623
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,540
only 30% of registered voters are voting.

624
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,580
Therefore, I think it's time to fire the conspiracy.

625
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,260
Yeah!

626
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,540
We're not loose, sir.

627
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,380
We're not loose.

628
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,120
We're not loose.

629
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,120
Yeah, we're not loose.

630
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,280
We're not loose.

631
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm saying it's time for the Church and the Subgenius

632
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,880
to become the cult to become the ultimate conspiracy

633
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,600
behind all others because they're blowing it.

634
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,860
The CFR, the Illuminati, fire them.

635
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,760
Kick them out.

636
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,700
Raise their rent so high they go to labor.

637
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,440
That's Pope Michael Flores talking.

638
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,020
but go ahead it's not gonna say fire the Illuminati go ahead the Illuminati they're out

639
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:22,020
well actually I think the Illuminati should uh they're the best alternative to chaos right now

640
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,380
the way the system is set up I think the Illuminati I think what would happen if we didn't

641
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,920
think what we have the Arizans running things everybody just be throwing things in the other

642
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,240
all you know you wouldn't you wouldn't have a good organized war there'd be no good weapons

643
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,700
systems it takes a certain amount of organization to bring out the tea garden yes yeah Larry or that

644
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:55,420
go that go remember that go for a miniseries that miniseries that was so cool it made it

645
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,240
seem like it was almost like real

646
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:15,200
the conceptual thing you know it's like when Orson Welles before the world you see

647
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:23,040
this is what it's for it's for testing that's what we you won't see a major war now you will

648
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,260
only see them small wars designed to prove the efficacy of weapons

649
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,440
systems that can then be turned around and sold at a profit to people who want those

650
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,200
weapons systems in case the same thing happens to them we no longer have two nations fighting

651
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:45,720
one another by building up nuclear arsenals we now have three major weapons markets competing

652
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,360
against one another throughout the planet for everything from small arms ammunition up to

653
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:57,160
air-to-air interceptor missiles and that's what it's all about the military-industrial complex

654
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:04,160
does exist it has existed and as long as monkey men have opposable thumbs and believe that the real

655
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,040
solution to anything is to pick up something heavy and beat with it you will continue to have weapons

656
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,760
and that's you know like if you want to talk about a big conspiracy then you should talk about the

657
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,280
commercial conspiracy which families and which banking companies sell arms where they sell arms

658
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,120
how much technology that our government licenses to other people to make

659
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,860
cheap weapons for how many generations have they been selling the F-16s to China

660
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,700
the guy

661
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,440
5,000 people at work they sold 150 you ever see that allowed the Russians to sell the

662
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,300
Sukarevs to China and get part of the cash money on their deal all of the arms deals are agreed ahead

663
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:55,640
of time there's no free market in arms the world's divided up you sell 115 X-16s over there the Eastern

664
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,320
block used to sell mix over there

665
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,900
you sell small arms here

666
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,420
cash flow

667
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,880
it's all cash flow

668
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,820
all history is nothing but a big cash flow chart

669
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:16,920
if you'll notice if you notice it started off with the Granada it was small then we went to Panama it was a little bit bigger and they get just a little bit they get it worked out you see and the Gulf War it's sort of like they're getting it

670
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:25,300
it's gonna be like it's like the Olympics it's like the Olympics every four years you have a commercial war you got more money on it than you would on NFL football

671
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,360
you just don't see the names matter

672
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,620
McDonald Lockheed

673
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,320
Ling Tamco

674
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,940
Graham Coat

675
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,080
all of those names

676
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,980
they're working it all out they get the details out once they get the media hooked in just right you know it's commercial

677
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,700
we want the Super Bowl dammit

678
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,280
yes

679
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,500
I want to see the

680
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,640
the Super Bowl of wars

681
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,700
let's see the Millie score if it'll fall apart

682
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:46,320
yeah

683
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,000
last for miles

684
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,260
what about the

685
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:49,520
the

686
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:50,900
what

687
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,960
the sports conspiracy

688
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,060
the sports conspiracy

689
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,440
what's the sports conspiracy

690
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,360
isn't it true that the sports conspiracy is a conspiracy?

691
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,640
the sports conspiracy is a conspiracy

692
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:58,840
to keep us out of the front

693
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,340
to keep our attention

694
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,360
of course

695
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,940
money money

696
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,300
it's all a circus

697
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,900
it's all a circus

698
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,260
to keep you deluded

699
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,860
to keep you stupid

700
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,600
and to keep you thinking about nothing else

701
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,000
but either your stomach

702
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,840
your genitals

703
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,620
or which part of your body may offend someone

704
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,440
that's what American culture and television is all about

705
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,180
to sell you a line of cheap shit

706
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,040
you should worry about how you smell

707
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,280
whether you're wearing the right armpit deodorant, whether or not your stomach is going to get you through the day.

708
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:40,440
You are being trained to feel uncomfortable about yourself. You're being trained to hate yourself.

709
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:48,580
They're numbing us with television so when they finally take over, it's like, hey, we see this on television every day.

710
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,240
Why the hell should we do it in real life? They think it's all real life. They create real life through TV sometimes.

711
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,680
Well, television is real life. They're trying to create real life.

712
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:10,120
It's all a matter of disempowerment. What they want you to do is they want you to pull the veil over your eyes and believe what is going on around you.

713
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:16,900
If you do what you want to do, then they say, hey, you failed somewhere, bud. You did something wrong. You want to do what you want to do.

714
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:24,080
We want you to do what we want you to do. And then what they want you to do is they want you to fight them because basically if you fight them, it's an impossible battle.

715
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,160
Yeah.

716
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,920
You lose.

717
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:36,680
Whereas if you turn it on yourself and fought the aspects within yourself that made yourself a more capable human being in control of the areas around you, you would have stronger effect on people.

718
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,180
And that's the only thing that you can do.

719
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,820
I'm not saying.

720
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:49,560
The problem with fighting the conspiracy is it's sort of like we're like mosquitoes trying to buzz a colossus.

721
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,940
And it's sort of pointless in that the colossus already has malaria.

722
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,220
Yeah.

723
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,980
What if you sing them in the eyes?

724
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:56,820
Oh,

725
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:56,860
the.

726
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,320
Promotions received when you kiss a blast off to self reinforce what you think you are.

727
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,620
You're not worth as much as a turd to me.

728
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,140
You played my on coast and it's all I can see.

729
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,560
Call me a sinner and call me a whore.

730
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,800
Don't change the truth that you're still a whore.

731
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,880
What's the difference between you know that you need to feel by the lies that you need.

732
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,240
I think.

733
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,380
And judges and some events like this, it was on you know on the bull Keith.

734
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't know.

735
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,420
Yeah.

736
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:33,660
But I agree.

737
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,640
Okay.

738
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:37,860
So you were in.

739
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:37,860


740
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,020
Yeah.

741
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,120
Remember his life?

742
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,120


743
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,120


744
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,120


745
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,120


746
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,120


747
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:46,900
Go,

748
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:46,900


749
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,780
guitar solo

750
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,760
Connie, it's not that Connie is smarter than Bob, it's just that she's wiser.

751
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,780
She knows where she's going, she just doesn't know quite how to get there, that's all.

752
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:39,820
But then the curve is always mightier than the sword, and if you can't get straight, you can always go around.

753
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,040
Woo!

754
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,680
Woo!

755
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,600
Heal me!

756
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,120
Oh!

757
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,240
Sister!

758
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,200
Sister, do you need to be healed?

759
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,100
Heal me!

760
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,920
Do you need to be healed?

761
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,180
I need some healing!

762
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,500
Oh!

763
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,100
Connie will give her some healing, she will give him some healing and some good soul,

764
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,420
because Connie knows the words to techno magic.

765
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:13,060
Time plus money, and preferably someone else's money, your money, if you give it to this church, equals slack.

766
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,320
It's a very simple concept, too.

767
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,040
Understand, but few can really put the words together.

768
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,240
They keep beating themselves into unconsciousness, stick themselves in the third eye.

769
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,100
They are dumb.

770
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:37,420
You see, you can't avoid the noid, but you can annoy the void, and reach into any situation, and pull yourself out by the bootstraps.

771
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:37,660
Oh!

772
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,320
Woo!

773
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:38,960
Woo!

774
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:45,740
Bob has been drunk so many times that he didn't think he could give it up, but when he gave it just that little bit of try,

775
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,120
it didn't take much to get him up and going.

776
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,660
Second coming, hell, that's for Jesus.

777
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,180
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth coming is for Bob and Connie.

778
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,980
They're coming all the time!

779
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,660
Right?

780
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,200
Swelling gushes!

781
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,840
Woo!

782
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,260
Anyway, so, let's see, where were we?

783
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,240
Oh, we were talking about techno magic.

784
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:15,420
Now, in order to understand techno magic, I have to take you all through an initiation.

785
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,620
Is everybody here ready to be saved?

786
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,360
Yeah!

787
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,740
Is everybody ready to be healed?

788
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,660
Yeah!

789
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,840
Alright, well, the first thing that we have to do is get rid of our bull.

790
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,280
And it's a very simple process, but few people know about it.

791
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,280
Reverend Dennis Murphy from the Cult of the Living Bull developed this.

792
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,100
And if I can have everybody just stand up from where you are.

793
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,260
Don't have to make a big deal about it.

794
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,440
Just stand up and get up nice and relaxed.

795
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,720
This is kind of like reading a book.

796
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


797
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


798
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


799
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


800
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,800
The new laws of the now section of our church.

801
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,040
And you just close your eyes.

802
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,560
When you close your eyes, just listen to what I have to tell you.

803
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,400
First, I'll tell you what bull is all about.

804
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:02,480
You see, everything that has ever gone into you, or ever will go into you, is input.

805
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,080
Right?

806
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,680
Right.

807
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,160
And everything that has ever gone out of you, or ever will go out of you, is output.

808
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:08,880
Huh!

809
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,760
Simple enough to agree on.

810
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,320
Now, the stuff that gets caught in between,

811
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,100
is bull.

812
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,120
And you need to get rid of that.

813
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,220
So, we're going to take three deep inhalations on your first breath.

814
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,060
I want you to visualize everything that has ever gone into you.

815
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,180
Anything that ever will go into you.

816
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,440
Anything that you ever wished to go into you.

817
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,860
Take a deep breath.

818
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,640
Ready?

819
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,860
And hold it.

820
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,380
And let it out.

821
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,260
Ahhh!

822
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,060
And on the second inhalation, I want you to think of anything that has ever gone out

823
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,320
of you.

824
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,860
Anything that's ever shot out of you.

825
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,460
Anything that's ever spewed out of you.

826
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,240
Anything that you've ever wanted to get out of you, or intend to get out of you in the

827
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,660
future.

828
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,940
And take a deep breath.

829
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,300
Ahhh!

830
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:01,920
And hold it.

831
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,020
And let it out.

832
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:03,920
Ahhh!

833
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,480
Ahhh!

834
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,620
You're getting aggressive with the concept of extra meditation.

835
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,720
I can see this.

836
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,300
Now, on the third inhalation, I want you all to think of something that's going to go

837
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,400
into you.

838
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,300
I want you all to think of everything that has ever gotten caught in between you.

839
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,180
Pieces of chicken in your teeth, your brain in your head, anything that's been dying and

840
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,600
just ripping to get out.

841
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,100
And I want you to take the third inhalation and hold it real tight.

842
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:31,600
Ready?

843
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,180
Ahhh!

844
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Now, at the top of our lungs, we're going to scream, bull!

845
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,780
And let it all out.

846
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,200
And scream as loud and as loud as we can.

847
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,680
And to the windows break.

848
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,700
Are we ready?

849
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,500
Yes.

850
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,740
One, two, three, bull!

851
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,060
This is a song about...

852
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,220
This is a song about those kind of problems that young men have.

853
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,200
No, it's not.

854
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,340
It's about problems we all have.

855
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,540
The call on everybody, stick your finger in your nose.

856
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,180
Pick up your phone.

857
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,180


858
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,440
Pick a burger out and wipe it on your clothes.

859
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,840
I don't know how you feel one way or another, if it makes you happy, then wipe it on your

860
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,080
brother.

861
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,900
So you're driving in your car and you're looking at your neighbor, minding that kid's

862
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,860
so misnastical it's like he's savoring the labor.

863
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,960
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's taking on his thing, it's a lonesome thing.

864
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,580
Still connected to his brain.

865
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,860
Pick a burger!

866
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,400
Pick a burger!

867
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,640
Pick a burger!

868
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:13,860


869
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,160
Pick a burger!

870
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,040
Everybody's doing it, picking it and chewing it.

871
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,320
That's a pile of horse manure, son.

872
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:38,120
Would you rather have somebody like George Bush or Bill Clinton telling you how to live your life,

873
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,200
or would you rather have somebody like J.R. Bob Dobbs?

874
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,120
Now let's talk some extended family values here.

875
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,660
Let's start building up some marital contracts between these countries,

876
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,200
because if I bet Omar had a good tantrum once in a while,

877
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,540
he might have his head screwed on a little bit straight,

878
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,960
and it would eliminate all the problems, reduce them to domestic affairs.

879
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,120
Who gives a what's going on in the family?

880
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,720
They can beat it out amongst themselves.

881
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,540
Well, hey, like I was saying, that's real family.

882
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,000
Hail the...

883
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,120
Hail the...

884
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,840
Subgenius fully extended nuclear family.

885
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:17,360
Right.

886
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,320
Kill the drummer.

887
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,300
Kill the drummer.

888
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,280
There you go.

889
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,100
Now I recognize it.

890
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,940
Don't you go dancing with your blue jeans on.

891
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,960
You better wear...

892
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,760
You better wear leather or maybe nylon.

893
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,940
You won't have to walk the street because I can see.

894
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,560
Looking at the board.

895
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,280
Oh, yes, dear friend.

896
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:12,800
Oh, yes, dear friend.

897
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,000
The swingin' love corpse is taking us out of the show here.

898
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:36,660
But I need to pause here and explain to you all that you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

899
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:43,420
And we've been visiting the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago last week.

900
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:44,680
And we've been visiting the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago last week.

901
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:44,680


902
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:44,680


903
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:44,680


904
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,660
On tape tonight.

905
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,900
And, oh, there's so, so much more.

906
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,020
We've really just begun.

907
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,260
That conspiracy panel discussion gets real lively in the second half,

908
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,340
which we'll go into next week.

909
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:04,360
And, of course, more of the swingin' love corpses and all those beautiful things.

910
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:10,460
But in the meantime, if you have questions about just what sort of a religious broadcast you're listening to,

911
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,240
you can write us for free information.

912
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:13,940
You can write us for free information.

913
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,000
If you've got to give that post office box number, got your pencil ready,

914
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,100
just write to Bob.

915
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,700
Bob won't actually get it.

916
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,440
He's our guru.

917
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,400
He's unapproachable to trash like you.

918
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,220
But we'll certainly send you some free information.

919
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:39,180
If you write to Bob at post office box 140306,

920
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,500
Dallas, Texas,

921
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,000
75,

922
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,160
2,

923
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:44,960
1,

924
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,420
4.

925
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,760
Once again, that's box 140306,

926
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,180
Dallas, Texas,

927
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,240
75,

928
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,180
2,

929

1,

930
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,320
4.

931
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,660
Ah, yes.

932
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,820
Yes.

933
00:58:59,360 --> 00:58:59,360


934
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,100
Yes.

935
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,000
Yes.

936
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,520
Yes.

937
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:05,980
Yes.

938
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,800
Yes.

939
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,720
Yes.

940
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,400
Yes.

941
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,060
Yes.

942
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:10,800
Yes.

943
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,640
Yes.

944
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,140
Yes.

945
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,540
Yes.

946
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:12,640


947
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,020
Yes.

948
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,560
Yes.

949
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,940
Yes.

950
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,940
Yes.

951
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,940
Yes.

952
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,680
Yes.

953
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,520
Yes.

954
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:29,720
Yes.

955
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,380
This is

956
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,860
one of two

957
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,100
videos

958
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:34,320
that

959
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,580
I've

960
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


961
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


962
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


963
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


964
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


965
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


966
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


967
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


968
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


969
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,580


970
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,660
absolutely

971
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,960
wonderful

972
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,220
on

973
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:39,440
Instagram.

974
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:39,920
We're

975
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,500
going

976
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:40,500


977
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:40,520
have

978
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:40,520


979
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:40,520


980
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:40,520


981
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:40,520


982
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,320
what

983
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:43,540
all

984
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:49,220
The doctors will cut into your third nostril,

985
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,920
opening it up

986
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,740
to reveal to your tiny brain a new dimension,

987
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,620
a new dimension in horror.

988
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,660
Monsters become real.

989
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,440
Oh!

990
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,780
And you can see it's her women's clothing.

991
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,000
It saved my life.

992
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,620
It saved my life.

993
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,100
And it can save your life, too.

994
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,480
It can save your life.

995
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,700
Now, the second thing we need to do is grounding and self-censoring

996
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,620
because, as we all know, there's no place like our egos.

997
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,120
So I want you to think entirely of yourselves

998
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,400
and begin chanting,

999
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:35,420
and just become so completely stuck up inside your head,

1000
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,280
stuck up inside your head,

1001
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,720
that you begin to believe that you are a channel

1002
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,700
for the true forces of Bob and Connie

1003
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,460
to come through.

1004
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,720
And they're down and laying up on top of your head

1005
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,120
like a flying saucer

1006
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,440
because, hey, you're supposed to be chanting my name.

1007
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,520
This is my chant.

1008
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,600
There's no place like my ego.

1009
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,300
Oh, God, you are true believers.

1010
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,040
I hail you.

1011
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,280
I hail you.

1012
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,080
Okay.

1013
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,780
Now that we are all truly grounded

1014
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,800
and caught up inside our heads,

1015
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,480
and now,

1016
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,100
now that we've gotten rid of our bull,

1017
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,000
we can fully admit that what's going on within us

1018
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,720
is going to go on without us,

1019
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,920
whether we like it or not,

1020
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,960
so we'd better happy up and have a good time.

1021
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,460
So get ready to get rid of our chickens

1022
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,100
and look at all absurdities and say,

1023
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,920
we are an ugly religion.

1024
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,620
We are, we pick our noses,

1025
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,900
we pyro-flagellate to the gods,

1026
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,920
and sex is messy.

1027
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,840
Now, praise the messy sex.

1028
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,180
We're just an old parishioners who just walk among car representation and

1029
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,180


1030
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,240
We've just gotindustrial домой

1031
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,640
Rememberh 첰

1032
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,780
Do you know the если

1033
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,560
Can you change the logo?

1034
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1035
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1036
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1037
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1038
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1039
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,560


1040
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:01,620


1041
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,800
eh,

1042
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,100
No, I gotta change the logo.

1043
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,560
Don't break the qualifiers.

1044
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,440
You better.
