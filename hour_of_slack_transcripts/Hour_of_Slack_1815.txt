Let me tell you something right now.
You keep talking, you're gonna talk your way right into jail.
The Self Genius Power of Science.
That's illegal.
Now just keep on talking.
Talk yourself right into jail.
The jails are full of guys that don't know when to keep their mouths shut.
The Self Genius Power of Science.
I was driving to a sanitarium, 25 Colorado Mass,
I sold it tonight to go out and get some booze, you know.
And I'm getting tired of the whole situation.
So I don't know, they better do something fast.
You take your time to talk.
And what happens to it's gonna happen to you.
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go,
no one's ever walked up to me and said, hey, you wanna buy some cigarettes?
Remember me, Ruben, in a little while.
I'm gonna drop my phone.
Put it in the toilet.
Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.
Can't sit in the sun.
I'm gonna negotiate.
I did it.
You don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you're gonna die.
And I know all the reasons for it.
I know every single reason for it.
Then you have the basic honk.
And the goose honk.
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.
Where are Donald and that shoe?
Hello?
Just what you call it.
You're just able to pick it up in a hurry.
Yo, yo, yo.
I've been thinking about all day long.
Because every day becoming much more practical for my inspiration.
But I'm fascinated to know that.
No way could you get that happy face.
I'm feeling when you are stealing that extra ball.
Bob, what a relief.
How you doing tonight?
His name is Bob.
Bob is not the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.
Take it from me.
Billy G is not Mr. Bob.
Come on, how many?
Come on, Bob.
How many posts do you think is good Michael?
Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Come on.
Will seven be enough, Bob?
They call him Bob Doves.
Yeah.
Bob Doves.





Yeah, I call him Bobo.
He was the leather man at a time when leather was nothing but wingtip shoes.
He led the way, brothers.
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.
Ah, the 50s.
I remember.
At first, a frivolous, sore-footed shoe salesman.
One day he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design when he messed around
with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil that we call the divine immaculation.
But you know his very name was Bob.
Bob Doves spawned a bornite in a upper bölter Appreciate it.
Bye-bye,So�'er.
See ya later.

Either
Or
with a tiny,
tiddling poodle.
She gave him comfort
and sheltered him
in a tree
to rest safely
until needed
by the show once more.
What's going on here?
Yeah, why don't we?
It's later than you think.
Aye, the terrible
spittin' vengeance
of Bob's mighty staff
shall scour clean
this planet
and the all-pervading
radioactive pastiche
of his boundless
supernatural love.
Wake up,
open your heart,
drop your pants,
close your mind
and bend over
because he'll be
kicking and taking names,
dear brothers and sisters.
He'll be struggling
and gasping.
His face will turn blue.
Then Bob will pitch over
on the floor
in the grip
of a massive
coronary thrombosis.
And we will be there
to see that event
and to record it for you.
And that's the way

As it was at the beginning
of time.
Come on,
I saw a man
with a pop and a grin
all in the new morning light.
Grinning.
Come on, sing along now.
Grinning with me
like a mad man
and he made me uptight.
I told him
don't bother me anymore
but he kept on
just the same
till I was totally brainwashed.
Bob is his name.
He's the ring.
Bob is my story.
Bob is my song.
Bob's my amphetamine.
All the day long.
Doo doo doo doo.
I won't tear my poster
of Dobbs down.
I'll feel no sadness or shame
till I behold him in Dobbs town.
Bob is his name.
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
He has no lack
of his patented slack
for those of his following fold.
He is the friend
of whoever will send
greenbacks or gold.
Doo doo doo doo doo.
He's growing stronger
and stronger.
He'll get all the credit
and blame.
I'll be a big boy no longer.
Bob is his name.
Doo doo doo doo doo.
Yes, it is a sad name.

I fail.
Bob's bigger than your Bob.
My Bob's bigger than yours.
My Bob's bigger than your big Bob.
My Bob's better than yours.
Huh!
Watch out.
The Bob, it's loose.
It's coming this way.
Back!
Back!
I created you.
Back!
Back!
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs' divine
immaculation.
All information was revealed.
The Dobbs in this blinding flash of knowledge,
which occurred, as every true subgenius
and every schoolboy knows,
when he was working back in the 50s
on an experimental television set
of his own design.
The transmitter was 100% redundant.
He was messing around with the back of a TV set
and it was suddenly immaculated.
Amplifier and multiplex the oral and visual.
Don't give it away.
Don't tell them.
Let them figure it out for themselves.
Bob arrived at the mountaintop location.
He found the transmitter to be operating properly.
Normally, it would return a system to standard operating.
Oh, you're giving away church secrets.
This is nuts, huh?
Don't listen to him.
He's giving away church secrets.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen.
The transmitter designed this stuck contact
to be found through visual interaction.
Does Alice figure any of this?
Alice?
Alice, with the pink laser beam.
Alice?
I don't know Alice.
Alice, Alice.
The visual transmitter associated with 22KV...
Ah, you're fading out.
You can't triangulate on your signal.
Speak into the rectifier.
Unfortunately, the visual network
and the neural network are not in order.
The power supplies are identical in appearance.
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.
The high voltage contactor is stuck in the opposition.
I'm out of contact.
He's out of control.
He's got a mind of his own.
Yes, that used to happen a lot on the Puzzling Evidence Show.
What do you expect from a radio station in Berkeley like KPFA?
Of course, we don't have that problem here at Hour of Slack,
because we don't have a radio station.
What we have is a radio studio high in this tree,
made entirely of rock, stick, and beast,
which is why it's called Tarzan's Radio Studio.
Our background music for credits tonight is the Psychoskeletons,
a bit called Cubist OCD Ritual.
And now, a word from our sponsor.
Located in the heart of the Earth,
located in the basement of the Donut King Drive-In,
is a new and unique dining experience,
freeway close, but far enough to work up one heck of an appetite.
It's Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restaurant.
Yes, Leg of the Crow.
Dining au naturel, nude and informal,
as it was in Rome before the tourists came.
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restroom,
where your host Vincent is ever ready to tickle your palate with a golden feather,
and the bathroom's just a quick drop down the hall.
Leg of the Crow,
where the salad's tossed at you, not at your table,
and sharing dessert with a stranger is almost a way of life.
And if you want to drink your dinner and dunk your date,
there's a wine list that'd make a Greek burp.
Squeezed fresh at your table in an aluminum thumb screw,
just like Daddy used to do.
Whet your whistle with these fine selections.
Chablis, Beau Cholet, Nippon Cadet, Cabernet, Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir.
Red, white, blue, any year.
You name it, we print it, you drink it at
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restaurant.
Conveniently located near the medical center,
color TV in every room,
phonetically translated, real French menu,
food to go, and free doggy bags supplied with every order of Vietnamese food.
At Vincent Tomein's domain,
the crippled crow.
And remember, you only live once,
but you have to eat,
every day.
Hey!
Little bit loud, okay.
I guess this is the end of the night where it's the new year.
And I should do a bit of reflection over the last year.
You know, a lot of stuff has changed.
A lot of things are different.
And they continually keep on changing.
Sometimes that's for the best,
sometimes it's for the worst.
But I can tell you this,
2020 was a shitty and great year,
all in one.
2021 has won in it.
And if 2020 was a shitty great year,
but all in one,
maybe 2021 will be the best year ever.
I don't know, who cares?
We all just wake up and act like we're just normal people anyways.
Like everyone acts like they just jump up
and their clothes are magically attached to them
like they're in some sort of video game.
No, that's not how it works.
You wake up and you walk around and you go,
oi, oi, oi, and aye, aye, aye.
And you just pop your pants on and then you go to work.
And you're super mad about life until the caffeine kicks in.
And then you're like, ah,
I'm going to die.
All right.
Well, I guess this is my day.
I actually had a good day today.
I hadn't had a good day at my conspiracy job in a long time.
And today was actually really great.
And it made me wonder what's going to happen next.
Who knows?
Hello, Moonbase.
It's been a really long time since we've heard from you.
Our diagnostic shows response times are slow.
And you're feeling blue.
We have made a plan.
As best we can.
Are there any surviving technicians that could lend a hand?
We'll send someone else to sort this out.
Worst case scenario, we'll just pull the cord.
You're not alone.
No, you're far from home.
You're not alone.


But you do have your friends, new employees, friends, and friends.
And they might be necessary, a little bit.
Sometimes it's key to do balance.


It's prたい делать.
Boris.
Are you still in the responses?
How do we get your investigationฅ?


I'm hoping that we can all answer either of your questions clearance vive la mese chegou
It was when those egghead scientists wanted to send me into space
They said the supercomputer that runs the whole works up there had gone catawampus on them
They needed me to take a rocket to the moon and see if I could get it working again
Reboot it, they said
But here's what I told them
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I'll work the land, I'll work it out, but I'll never work in space
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I said it before, I'll say it again
I'll never work in space
I'll never work in space
They didn't want to take no for an answer
But there are a set of rules that I live by
Rule seven is always return your shopping cart
But rule five is don't do work in space
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I'll work from home and burn the midnight oil
But I'll never work from space



It's too cold up there
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
It doesn't hurt, Bill
A lick of work never hurt no one
But I'll never work from space
Now I'm not proud of everything that went down after that
They really wanted to send me to the moon
Let's just say I didn't end up going to space
And I'm not proud of everything that went down after that
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I'll learn a trade, I'll toil away
But I'll never work in space
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I'll bust my buns and still have some fun
But I'll never work in space
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space
I'll swap the deck and write some scripts on spec
But I'll never work in space
I'll be gone forever
They say we live on forever
In the hearts and memories of those we know
And I don't have a heart
And I'm not programmed to have a soul
In my memory of the soul
In my memory of the soul
In my memory of the soul
And that was a piece called Moonbase Suite
by Reverend Morgan Glutentag.
I agree with the theme of that song.
I will not work or even party in space
if it involves vehicles made by Earthmen.
Before that, we heard a little commentary
by Reverend Negative
and some classic Firesign Theater
from their first radio shows.
Hey, I just thought of something.
Why are butts hidden behind us?
Why can't we have butts
on both sides?
Sure, that's like eyes in the back of your head.
These mud-gobbling giant worms
which live on the edge of volcanic vents
gorging themselves on massive, huge piles of mud.
Just like those tremor worms.
Just like the ones in Dune.
Only this mud is wet.
This is truly wet mud.
Not like the ones in Dune.
Not like the kind of mud we used to have
back when we were kids.
It was dry mud.
We used to have to make mud pies
and to make them stick together
we had to spit on them.
We'd have dirt in one hand
and a big pile of spit in the other hand
and we'd roll them together
until we had us a good mud pie.
And that was the only thing we had
for moisture back in those days.
Just spit.
We didn't have candy back then either.
We had to just take a bag of sugar
and carry it around.


We carried around a big old five pound bag of sugar
in our back pocket.
A big old tablespoon.
And when we needed some candy
we just stuck it into the bag
and just took about four or five big tablespoons
shoveled it down
and that was all we had for candy back in those days.
Each one genetically engineered
to make a difference.
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies
you gotta have
those worms have to have lamps
to see underground
when they're eating through the dirt like that.
They carry little like little miners helmets
that let them mine through the dirt.
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.
Oh, I can't see where I'm going said Mr. Worm
and he looked ahead and he had his little pointed
yellow helmet on
shining the way into the back of the goose
as it were.
The terrific.
The end of the goose
was a Cretaceous flying reptile.
Flying.
They thought it was a reptile
but actually it was a bird.
It was a bird.
They found that it was only a simple bird.
It was a bird like reptile.
Its body was only that
the size of a goose.
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide
at their widest proportion.
27 feet or 30 actually.
Where's Bozo?
Larger specimens recently discovered.
What the heck is...
It's the Twinkies.
Twinkie bike.
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie bike.
And so the Twinkie bike headed out
through the desert carrying the little show people.
They asked me about...
Twinkie bike, Twinkie bike.
They asked me about Twinkies on my show
and they asked what the ingredients were.
Of course all I could tell them was...
That's when I got fillies.
Golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.
That's all you need to know.
You don't need to know anything more than...
That is all on earth you know and all you need.
I will enter that into the...
I'm gonna get that.
...golden life.
That's good enough for Thor.
That's good enough for me.
The United States of sponge.
...a creamy soft whipped...
Yes little caller, you have won the United States of sponge.
...filling everywhere in the valley...
As we continue to look for your requested songs...
...from the valley of Brazil...
...the commercial songs of the United States of sponge.
...from within the confines of its donut-like home.
Thank you Philo, Hal and Doug.
Other Doug.
Did you know?
That at one time, very early in its history...
...the church of the subgenius was one-third Doug's?
In its first month, basically anyway.
From the new collection of old Fireside Theater stuff...
...dope humor of the 70s...
...here's one of my very favorite bits...
...from the Dear Friends show and album.
It's Phil Proctor mostly.
It's all bluff from top to bottom.
Here's Pat Bluff, former governor of the state of Arizona...
...who's with us on our show, Policeman Meet the Nation.
Yeah, just to me, studying it...
...it looks like the whole system of life is bluff.
A man just bluffs himself out of the cradle onto the floor...
...just bluffs his legs into carrying him around...
...when he gets sick of crawling...
...and he gets to it and yaps and bluffs his mama into carrying him.
Hey Sam, can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
What does that mean what you just said?
I didn't understand a word of it. It's poetic.
I worked it all out...
You did?
...over 65 years.
That's a distillation...
It's all bluff.
That's a distillation of 65 years of philosophy, Sam.
It ain't no difference, young nor old.
We just start right in to bluff somebody from the first...
...if it's only to yap when we're brought into the world...
...as if we hate it and wish to get out of it quick.
Sam, look at that fellow over there, right?
Yeah, he's Cor...
He's just gotten to Corrin, right?
Yeah, hi, look at him.
Hey, look at him.
Ain't that the biggest bluff of all?
Well, I think he gets...
...you know, he gets right along with some female girl...
...and he pitches her some yawns and some yams by himself...
...such a thing as the blush of the shame...
...to the features of George Washington.
Yeah, he makes her believe he's just what every fella...
...of her sense knows he ain't...
...and she, bluffing herself like mad...
...bluffs herself into believing she believes what he believes...
...she believes what nobody else believes about him...
...that he's filling her up with truth, see?
Now I understand what you're saying, Sam.
Yeah, sure.
Now you're talking university talk.
Think about when they have kids, then.
The kids come along, right?
And he's got to bluff harder than ever.
But kiddies take a heap of bluffing, Sam.
They do.
They sure do.
I didn't say you got six of them.
You have to bluff six times as hard, then.
I know.
It drains every ounce of laugh force out of my body.
You have to buff their shoes, make sure they're shining.
Shine their head so the planes will see them and not land on them.
That's right.
I had a plane land on two of my sons yesterday.
You did, eh?
Makes me laugh, too. I saw it.
Well, they're just plane kids.
Yeah, that's right.
Passing plane came right by, took the top...
Well, go ahead.
Anyway, you go on like this, Charlie.
Like I've been going on.
Like you've been going on...
...till death gets around, see?
That's all right.
You're sick.
Coughing.
Sick and coughing. Coughing is the word.
You can't bluff death, which is the reason you gotta get off the earth.
When you're fixed that way, other folks come along and bluff you, see?
What about your friends?
Sam, your friends go around and tell you that they're...
You know, they heap a sorry.
And the kids come and they make you feel like you've treated them bully
and acted sugar and square with them.
The gal you bluffed in the interim, she gets around and snivels.
The doctor bluffs, the preacher bluffs, the president bluffs, the snifter bluffs.
Then death gets a drop on you.
Yeah, yeah.
You go right down and out.
Right down and out.
Everything's bluffed, sir.
To your left.
To your left.
Until you get up again in the muzzle of a gun like this.
Then your thumbs get up quick and you bluff yourself that bluff is one of them things
you'd hate like poison to hand out to a blind mule, whatever that means.
Yeah, right.
But you agree with me, don't you?
Because I got a gun on you.
You got a finger on me.
I respect a finger more than I respect a gun.
That's the point.
You can stick my eye out with that, but I've never seen anybody hurt with a gun.
I'm pointing you with this sharp fingernail.
Yeah, with a heavy ring on it, too.
All bluff.
So I really respect the heavy ring finger.
All bluff.
Yeah, right.
That's the ring of doom, though.
I know that.
I know that.
I know that.

My name is Legion.
Yours is...
Hey.
Yours is...
Is Mr. Legion here?
Sir, you're...

Did you say your name was Legion?

No, I said my name was...
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.
Repetition is the key to art.
Repetition is the key to redundancy.
Repetition...
It is the key to learning and to dubstaff.
And as the great gates open up and the high priestess ushers Dave in...
...and the great light sings, she was a woman.
And she was the light that the dark she was wearing a lei and a sound dress.
And she said she was related to the great light singer Ema Sumac, if you could imagine
such a thing.
But there she was in her zip-up top, and her head was all zipped up, believe me.
There wasn't a part showing.
And there was no sunshine coming through the back door either, the way old Mammy and Pappy
down on the farm used to sprinkle.
She was quick.








to the mug, 100%.
But they said they were going to still
have to do a few things.
So she led us around. We had a few eggnogs.
We stood and watched the trees burn.
And then we
entered the actual inner center
center sanctorum of Domstown
itself. It was
beautiful.
Look at those
gigantic sculpted
statues carved from the
native volcanic rock.
They look like
famous subgenius radio personalities.
What's that bald-headed one?
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And look, the one with the giant lips.
That's Dances
with Rockets. And that really handsome
one, isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?
The mountain itself, by God,
I just realized, it's carved
into a gigantic
gob's head.
The size of 10 Mount Rushmore.
Try this chocolate phosphate
drinking fountain. It's free.
Oh my God, it's delicious
and it's psychoactive, too.
I can feel my...
I can feel everything. I can feel my knees.
I can feel my sandwiches.
I can hear sandwiches in my back pocket.
They're speaking to me,
Stanley.
Learn from the sandwiches.
Feel of your sandwich,
Dave. Feel of it.
On and off the road
to Bob's
club.
We are marching
forward
blind.
He has gouged out
both our eyes.
And he's laughing
close behind.
He will sell us
back our eyes
when we join
his noble
plan.
For just
$19.95
and a taste
of our
woodland.
On and off the road
with Bob,
he has handed
us
the wheel.
And he cuddles
up with
Bob.
Ah!
As he
counts
his
sal-
a-
feel.
Our eyes
are on
the road.
But Bob
forgot
to say
that the
steering
wheel went
fast.
The road
carries
us
away.
On and off the road
for Bob,
we forgot
why we came
here.
We have quit
all of our
jobs.
Like a headlight
frightened deer.
He has lit
the same
lights
















with pipe.
And he's smiling
at us
now.
On and off the road
he's Bob.
He's our
bull dada.
We all
miss
now.
Woo!
That hurt, Bob.
Bob, where are you?
Stop it, Bob.
Please.
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy doing all the voices on his song On and Off the Road with Bob.
Incidentally, in his fake life, Bleepo is a character actor in Los Angeles named Bill
Cates, and he's really good.
And if you want him for a paying movie or show, I can put you in touch with him.
Before that, we heard a little ESO Swamp Radio with Professor Chas, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
But now, Puzzling Evidence offers a mental exercise for dealing with a very poorly recorded
sermon by the late Dr. Le Guin.
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes
me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're a...

And remind me...
And remind me...
Imagine that you're in the car with the windshield wipers going, and you're listening
to this religious show on the radio.
Okay.
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?
Gotcha.
Okay, I'm there.
I'm driving.
I'm beginning to visualize now.
Oh, what?
Don't take your eyes off the road, though.
And now I'm in the car with a guy.







I can see it.
I can see it.
I can begin to see the beginnings of it.
And...
Tranks and tucks and sump.
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,
driving around Texas.
You know, Texas.
I understand that Texas is about the size of Iraq.
Really?
Yeah.
Is that true?
So when they say, you know, Texas is about the size of Iraq.




They go in and see if you can find some nukes.
My test would be, well, let's go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas
somewhere and say, now go see if you can find it.
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.
You know, I think that...
That would work.
You could buy that...
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the...
Hide it in Texas?
And hide it in Texas.
You could put up by Amarillo next to Cadillac Ranch and then...
I'd take it.
I'd take it out to the...
You just wouldn't see it.
To the Texas Triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda Triangle,
but on land in Texas.
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.
Wow.
Until I needed to find it.
You like them young, Bob?
How old were you when you met Bob?
Bob?
Bob is innocent.
It's like they're trying to fill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.
Some people derive sexual pleasure through inflicting physical, emotional abuse.
Oh, God, no.
No, I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.
I'm sorry.
No, I'm not sorry.

Bob's cold.
Manipulative.
Bob is innocent.
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.
Without him, you're worthless.
Nothing.
She knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed.
Bob didn't do it.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
I went to medical school for two years.
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.
Oh, God, no.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Maybe he's just an asshole.
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Bob was right about you all along.
No!
Oh, damn it! Don't lie to me!
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.
Bob is innocent.
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.
Bob tells you how to feel, how to act.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Bob is innocent.
Who were you when you met Bob?
Ahab had it coming.
He just wouldn't acknowledge it.
He refused to believe that he could be sprawled whole like a net,
swimming to the edge of the beer glass,
hoping for escape and one last drink,
refusing to accept his fate.
Ahab was farsighted, to be sure,
and the eye patch to cover his missing eye did not improve his outlook.
However, determination was his,
and he was determined to do what he was doing.
He shall have this giant thing, bigger than his own ship,
if only he could catch sight of it.
The whale is patient, pacing and calculating.
Forward, men, forward!
The captain yells, pushing the boat further,
away from its prey, aimlessly chopping the waves,
like the only seen-on-TV onion chopper,
in 1999 with free shipping,
which the cook is, in fact, using below deck
to prepare what is to be the crew's final meal.
But don't get ahead of yourself,
as the tale has yet to unfold.
Well, there is a bunch of water,
and the ship is floating on top of it,
and...
Look out! There's a big goddamn fucking whale!
The nearsighted whale was merely coming in for a closer look.
Ahab grabs the biggest pointy stick at hand
and jabs at the mighty curious beast's eye.
The sharp object does not penetrate
through the custom-crafted contact lens
provided by lens crafters in return for a cameo
in the dramatized remake of actual fictional events
that may or may not have happened.
The whale, nicknamed Toby, submerges and swims on.
Ahab plunges his spare sharp stick into the deck
and loudly declares,
Well, what's for lunch?
Good question!
That was the entity called Sheridan,
telling the story of Toby Dick versus Captain Ahab.
The weird spooky music before that was an old piece by the Elk Kaiso All-Stars
that fell through the cracks of the ship, and fell into the water.
I would not have gotten into the cracks of the ship
if it had not been for the sound of the water.
A few years ago, I was there in the middle of the ship.


I have heard it for a long time, and it was a great surprise.
I would have found it down in the crack.
It was a very good song for me.


And we'll listen to a most challenging instrumental,
also by the Elk Kaiso All-Stars, after this word from our mentors.
You couldn't have felt worse with no sleep at all.
Yes, morning finds you limp as a rag and blue as indigo.
How you dread to face another day.
Achy, dull, yes, only half alive.
You feel and act like an old, old man.
yet strangely enough, the cause of your rundown condition is simplicity itself.
Yes, friends, simplicity.
And to take care of your simplicity problems,
to restore you to full vigor and health,
take athnesia with Pluto Water.
Good afternoon, friends.
I'm Charles Blank from the United States Census Bureau.
Are you the janitor of this building?
Yes, I'm Mr. Harris, the janitor.
Mr. Harris, is apartment three vacant,
or is someone living there?
My business is of yours, Mr. Blank.
I see.
I have to fill a questionnaire for the apartment,
even though no one is living there.
Can you answer a few questions?
I'm not talking to anybody.
Is apartment three intended for year-round or seasonal occupancy?
You nosy bastard.
Take your farm and get out of here.
Is it for rent or for sale?
You're not getting anything out of me.
I don't like your look.
Would you stick to that?
How many living quarters, occupied and vacant, are at this address?
Hey, are you a stuck record or something?
Don't you understand?
I'm not giving you any of these questions to answer them.
Does apartment three have complete kitchen facilities?
Complete kitchen facilities are a sink with piped water,
a range or cook stove, and a refrigerator.
Is it for that unit only?
Or are there rooms for another house?
How many rooms are in apartment three?
Do not count.
Bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyer halls, or...
Hey, you giving my friend Harry any trouble?
Is there hot and cold piped water in this building?
Let's throw him out.
Does apartment three have a flush toilet?
Yes, and you're going right down it.
Come on with me.
For apartment three only, or is it...
No, you don't.
Yes, millions of men and women are in the same lamentable plight today.
And not one in ten can guess the cause.
That's the insidious thing about amnesia.
It drags you down, slows your mind,
and robs you of your joys and pleasures,
yet you hardly realize that you're slipping.
You're right, Roy.
Isn't that true?
Whoops!
The eye of light is looking right through you.
God bless you.
You know, the folks at French Lick Springs Hotel
in French Lick, Indiana,
that's America's greatest...
French Lick.
...health retort.
French Lick.
The home of Pluto water.
It's known as...
If you...
Call that a home, Ray.
The light's shining.
Go.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
You know, we have two excellent golf courses down there.
Three.
Splendid.
No, only two.
Ah, but the eye of light sees three, Ray.
It sees three.
Ah.
Wonderful, wonderful golf courses.
I see.
I see.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
The power's coming up through the table.
Splendid, splendid riding facilities.
You're a weird pastor.
Ride.
Ride on.
I'm on you.
I'm with you.
Ride.
And lots of outdoor amusements...
Yes.
...are provided.
Yes, but God's looking down on everything you do outdoors, friend.
That's true.
That's true.
God's got his eye on your eye, so watch out and keep going, Charlie.
Carry an umbrella.
Decide right now to turn the tables on old man gloom, huh?
Turn them upside down.
Take Pluto water every morning for ten mornings.
Yeah, by golly.
And see a new world in ten days.
See two new worlds here, friend.
Two new worlds.
You're going to need to.
Down, Pluto.
Down.
Larry?
Well, by golly, God said...
Look, Pluto's making more water.
Huh?
Excuse me.
That's okay, St. John.
And God said...
This is when I was with God in Miami.
He said, uh...
Harry, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.
Do you know what subdue means?
Is it like sublet?
Hey, Harry, is that guy down there asking you questions again?
No, dear friends, janitors of all the lonely houses in the world.
I know you've had your bad times, and I know you've had your good times,
doing things you didn't understand.
God bless you, pastor.
But things are changing, friends.
The eye of God is looking down upon you right now.
Who asked you, pastor?
Look him back in the eye, dear friends.
I can't see.
Either can God, dear friends, because love and radio is blind.
Don't blink.
Don't blink, dear friends.
My radio's on the blink.
My radio's on the blink, dear friends.
God, I love your eyes, Father.
Eye.
Just one eye.
The eye of love.
Spelled eye.
The letter I.
Without the letter...
What could we do, dear friends?
And remember, friends,
it's been brought to you today by
snifters, humorous napkins,
hot trays, cassette-ner coasters, and bun warmers,
drop earrings, finger scarves, gavels, and sash buckles,
shredded cellophane and parchment scraps,
squeeze toys, mechanical toys,
blow-up women and extra parts,
or...
Quembray질

Of course. He has a
fleet of limos now that carry him all over
the country.
And those damn hillbillies who
work for him just
love to crush little creatures on the road.
Yep, that's what they do down

Yee-haw!
That's what we say here.
Who is this?
Well, I don't know.
You're playing the record.
