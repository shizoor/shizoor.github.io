1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for our Slack.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,360
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, Living Avatar of Slack, and Saint of Saints.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,940
You have to love Bob.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,040
He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,840
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,540
He'll kill you. He'll bob you out.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,720
Though Christ was not our Savior, nor born on Christmas Day,

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,140
to save us all from atom bombs when we have gone astray.

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,180
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,640
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,980
to think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,100
Remember when you go to church, believers,

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,320
what you blame.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,280
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,860
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,180
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,560
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,080
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,820
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,000
God save ye weary citizens, for this will make ye sick.

23
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,420
That Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a stick.

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,820
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,880
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
God save ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,020
Was the St. Baphomet Neo-Pagan Reform-

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,780
no I'm sorry.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Something like that-

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,020
Let me say this right.

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,160
St. Baphomet Neo-Pagan Reformed Choir of Miskatonic University.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,580
How young I sound, Friend-

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,180
It was gonna be an official Christmas show.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah, God, I sound like a little child back then in the, back in them days.

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,540
Well.

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,820
When the promise was my show, when the atoms were placed up in a衣

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:07,540
friends, I, you know, I was, I was so depressed yesterday. And when I came out of it, I wrote a

39
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:14,180
wonderful rant about being depressed. And I was going to, I was going to read it to today on the

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,240
show, but then I got too depressed again. But then I remembered it's Christmas and everybody's

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,740
supposed to be depressed. And, um, and on top of that, I, it, it kind of got me off the hook

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,280
because that means that I could run the old Christmas special. Huh? Suddenly without warning.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:42,660
Yes, dear friends, I'm saved because, um, because we do have, uh, a Christmas special that I can

44
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,180
always use chunks of, uh, like that last song. And we have this new wonderful Christmas music

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,500
from Ray Brunel and the Jethro's, an entire, uh, album of,

46
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,460
uh, nothing but insane Christmas music like this heard in the background. And, uh,

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,020
oh, let's just listen because it hurts so good.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,440
Lundering through a winter fun land, dear friends. And, um, you know, what the heck,

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,880
what the heck? So it's Christmas time. It's, uh, we can, we all,

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,100
we can celebrate a religion that we don't believe in and, uh, and give presents to people we have

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,680
to give presents to. Uh, yes, isn't it? And we get to get together with our families and all our

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:50,940
family members, even those ones and all pretend to be happy and praise the birth of, uh, that first

53
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,900
Jesus guy.

54
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,240
What really went wrong? You know, cause you always have that thing in the back of your mind. Well,

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,100
gee, maybe did I screw up someplace along the line to cause this all to happen? I mean, you have to

56
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,280
bring home some evidence saying, Hey, folks, it wasn't my fault. Take a look at this picture.

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,480
You know, something happened back there.

58
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,380
I wasn't back there.

59
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,820
I am not responsible. Not for your problem, buddy. Your problem that causes you to tell me what all

60
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,400
my problems are. I'm not responsible. And if you try to make me feel like I am, then you can take

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,960
it and shove it where Bob Dobbs and his family don't care to look. Cause I didn't do it. I didn't

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
have anything to do with it. And I'm not going to feel guilty about it just cause you decided

63
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,960
somebody had to be blamed for something. No, sir, ma'am I'm on vacation. You know what I do when I'm

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,440
on vacation?

65
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,520
I work cause I'm tired of trying to work. I'm going to just work this time. I'm going to just say no to

66
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,920
play. I don't care who wants to play. If they've been my friend for 15 years, if I've been married

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,780
to him for 25 years, I don't care. I'm going to work cause that's my slack. And I just about had

68
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,280
a nervous breakdown over feeling guilty because I didn't play with everybody else enough.

69
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,100
I don't feel like you were the bad guy cause you wanted to work. Well, ironically enough, that may be

70
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,640
because you are a subgenius and the rest are pinks or else conspiracy dupes. It's the conspiracy that

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,740
said that work was supposed to be unpleasant and bad, but necessary because of the money. And it's

72
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,780
the conspiracy that said, oh, you aren't having fun or playing if you're working at what you were

73
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,320
born to do. No, you're only having fun if you're drinking and smoking dope or else at the very least

74
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,380
spending money and eating, uh,

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,720
whatever you want to call it.

76
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,320
I don't care if other people wait on you and laugh and real loud about all those other dumb people.

77
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,660
You're only having fun when you're wasting your time. Well, Bob, that stuff. And not only that,

78
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,880
but I'm going to do exactly whatever work I think needs to be done. How about them apples, huh?

79
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm not going to do the work that you think will be good and sell and make the world better in

80
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,060
some small way. Or even what Bob says I do or what A&M says I do. No, I'm going to do exactly what I

81
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,340
think is going to be good and sell.

82
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,400
And make the world better in some small way or not. Or not. I have suffered way too many fools.

83
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,480
Way too gladly for way too long. And as a result of being such a sweet, nice guy,

84
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,540
I ended up with a whole buttload of critics whining that I didn't do enough for them.

85
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,480
And with myself all balled up in a corner of the garage this morning, all by myself screaming,

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,700
leave me alone. I hate you. I hate you. Leave me alone. Let me flee at the top of my lungs and

87
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,720
with only a few words left. I'm going to do exactly what I think is right. I'm going to do exactly what I think is right.

88
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,300
only the puzzled new guard dog to hear me.

89
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,200
And I, friends, I happened to have had an appointment

90
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,940
with a shrink in the afternoon

91
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,300
because several people who are definitely crazy

92
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,480
think I'm crazy and it takes one to know one.

93
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,180
And I told the shrink about how I was starting to feel

94
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,660
like I was in an airless box

95
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,980
with all six sides closing in at once.

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,260
And she said, well, maybe you're just going to have to say no

97
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,160
to some of these people.

98
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,940
And guess what?

99
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm going to do just what the doctor said.

100
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,700
And I suggest you do too, my friend.

101
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,000
You really do know what's best for you.

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
And all those hundreds of nagging weenies and widgets

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
don't know Bob crap.

104
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,320
In fact, most of them don't even know what they want.

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,060
And that's why they're telling you what all you want.

106
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,100
And that's most people, I'm afraid.

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Most people have not the slightest idea

108
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,100
of what they want to do next

109
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,580
and are probably better off letting the boss

110
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,140
and the shrink know what they want.

111
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,140


112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,400
And they're not going to let the boss

113
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,040
and the spouse and the church

114
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,720
and the society run their lives for them.

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,640
But some of us not only have such a long list of things

116
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,220
that we want very much to do

117
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,260
so long that we know we can't possibly ever do them.

118
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,760
But we're also, believe it or not,

119
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,900
smart enough to make our own decisions.

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,940
I'm smart enough to decide right now

121
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,420
whether or not I'm going to go get drunk.

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,100
I could go get drunk right now.

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,300
And I might.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,040
I could also decide not to.

125
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,120
but screw anybody who tries to tell me.

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,080
And that especially includes the Miller Beer Company

127
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
and the Reynolds Tobacco Company

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,020
and all those Republican drug cartels

129
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,560
with their damn so-called war on drugs.

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,320
If I want to OD on heroin, I will.

131
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,080
If I want to become a cop and beat up junkies, then I will.

132
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,700
If I want to screw some willing babe in the closet,

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,960
then perhaps I damn well will.

134
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,700
And if I get caught, then I'll take my lumps.

135
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,340
But no, I won't.

136
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,980
I shouldn't have to take any lumps.

137
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,460
The only people who are going to care

138
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,560
whether some willing babe and I go do it in the closet

139
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
are the ones that can't.

140
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,180
And because, friends, as crazy as I might be

141
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,980
and as dumb as I might be,

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,180
and I often feel like the dumbest, most naive,

143
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,860
redneck, unsophisticated, just-got-in-town, clumsy subgenius,

144
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
the most horrible, horrible aspect of all this is,

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
as screwed up as I am,

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,860
I really am still saner and smarter

147
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,900
than any of the humans,

148
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,660
and you may be, too.

149
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,800
Now, that is a really chilling thought, friends.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,140
But not only must we stop trying to ignore that thought,

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
we have to start acting on it.

152
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
Or at least I do, or I really will go off my rocker.

153
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,560
So enough is enough.

154
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,040
Enough trying to be some armchair amateur's idea of good.

155
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,380
I went to the mental health professionals,

156
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,100
and they themselves agreed

157
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,800
that I am...

158
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,440
not insane,

159
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
everybody else is,

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,160
I am right to be ticked off,

161
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,840
and thousands of buttheads really are out to get me.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
So once again, I say,

163
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,520
with as much feeling as I have ever said it in my life,

164
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,440
I can't say this on the radio,

165
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,900
but it's, you know, if they can't take a joke,

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
you know what to do, friends.

167
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,880
So I'm sure you'll understand if I don't happen to

168
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,400
respond to your email this vacation,

169
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,160
or do that thing with you that you wanted to do or whatever,

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,260
don't take it personally,

171
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,780
I did, and it doesn't pay.

172
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,960
Build your own ship.

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,860
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

174
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,420
As you can see all around you, they're sparking.

175
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,080
There was a short circuit.

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,980
The brain seems to have recovered.

177
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,800
There are sparking energy thoughts all around us.

178
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,300
Far more than the normal human brain.

179
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,200
But as we know...

180
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
Another misfire there.

181
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,120
We know Doug Smith is not a normal human.

182
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,360
No, and here inside the brain of Doug Smith,

183
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,360
we can observe some of the differences that make this man

184
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
a unique leader among humans.

185
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,500
And we can see that he's a very strong man.

186
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,260
Over here in this corner are the memory bands.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,700
And over here is the main printout area.

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,780
This is the South Canada Radio Ministry.

189
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,960
Power of Land and Oil FX.

190
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,380
Praise Bob.

191
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,140
To be a good man.

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,700
To be a good man.

193
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,840
To be a good man.

194
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,820
Your source is not in the tank.

195
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,540
Your source is not in the bank.

196
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Your source is above you.

197
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:56,960


198
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,220
In another dimension, sex, in another world.

199
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,940
Oh, my, how far it can go.

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, that's a good long, long time.

201
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
Oh, sex, well, I had no intention.

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,440
Sex, not with nobody, girl.

203
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh, I tried and I tried.

204
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,640
I will, I tried.

205
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,720
I will, I tried.

206
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh, it's not with crazy men.

207
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:17,260
I will, I tried.

208
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,400
Oh, sex, well, I had no intention.

209
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,640
Sex, now in another dimension.

210
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,940
Oh, sex, well, I tried and I tried.

211
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:26,940


212
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:26,940


213
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,140
about

214
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't look at me.

215
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
I put a down payment on a small red dwarf.

216
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,620
You've got suckered, man.

217
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,520
No, it's a really small one.

218
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,300
It's just like, you know, the size of a car.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
So I was going to put it in the backyard.

220
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,540
Look, right.

221
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,820
Still, it's going to draw your entire house and most of your neighborhood right into it.

222
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,520
It's just going to be a slightly bigger red dwarf in a much smaller neighborhood.

223
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,800
Yeah, right.

224
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,980
Your neighborhood will essentially become the paint on the outside of that red dwarf.

225
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
And some of this will eventually suck the whole planet up.

226
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,040
Would it?

227
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
Or would it eventually?

228
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,720
I mean, it's only the size of a car.

229
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,060
I mean, we're not talking about a whole neutron star, right?

230
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,660
You're talking about it would still be hot.

231
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,320
A red dwarf is almost a little bit bigger than, like, you know, mass-wise than Jupiter.

232
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,840
It's like the smallest star you can create.

233
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,440
But one ounce of it weighs.

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,580
A ton.

235
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,180
No, no, that's a neutron.

236
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,940
Oh.

237
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,840
A neutron star.

238
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,460
One tablespoon weighs as much as the largest mountain on the Earth.

239
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,380
One tablespoon of neutron matter.

240
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,520
I've got, like, a gram of that hanging from my...

241
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,140
Well, I don't want to...

242
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,060
It's a trendy piercing thing.

243
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,740
Well, yeah, we used to snort it back in the disco days.

244
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,580
Snorting neutron star matter?

245
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,060
Yeah.

246
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, God, how could you see in the next day?

247
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,600
It seems like you'd be, you know, in the bathroom.

248
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
It would just be...

249
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,660
It would be so hard to keep.

250
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,040
Yeah, you'd almost have to wear lead diapers or something.

251
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah, very reinforced.

252
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,420
Well, it'd only take a little bit.

253
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,640
It's just like not even a match head full.

254
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,400
But a match head full weighs as much as, you know, a couple of semis.

255
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,540
Oh, yeah, at least.

256
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,420
Yeah, people don't...

257
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,400
We're not just jabbering inanely.

258
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,340
There are neutrons.

259
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,100
There are really such things as neutron stars out there in space that are collapsed.

260
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,980
Right.

261
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,760
Old stars that have all the...

262
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,500
Massive stars collapsing the size of, like, New York City.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, there's no...

264
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,460
What is it?

265
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,980
I guess they're...

266
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,600
All the forces.

267
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,940
They're all neutron, right?

268
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,500
They're just the energyless atom core.

269
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,460
Right.

270
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,020
They're all in together.

271
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,080
And the only thing keeping them from just collapsing down to nothing...

272
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Nothing.

273
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,480
Nothing.

274
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,180
I think they're down to the last force there.

275
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,800
The weak nuclear force.

276
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah, they're just so tight.

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,640
They're so tight-packed.

278
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,020
Can't get nothing in there.

279
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,060
Add just a little more matter to it and it'll disappear.

280
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
Dear friends, well, I bet if there...

282
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,740
I bet you could get in there if there was hair around it.

283
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

284
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,260
Friends, I almost forgot it was Christmas.

285
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,480
But I have to give credit there for that ESO.

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,700
Wonderful Einstein Secret Orchestra song, sax.

287
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,700

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,900
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

290
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
And Bob Mosick on drums.

291
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,580
Here is the address of Einstein Secret Orchestra,

292
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,580
who we also heard on that little radio clip afterwards.

293
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,220
ESO P.O. Box.

294
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,540
81555.

295
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,800
That's P.O. Box 81555.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,880
Cleveland, Ohio.

297
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,980
Cleveland, Ohio.

298
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
Backwards, that's...

299
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,260
Y-hole DNA level C.

300
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,560
Zip code 44181.

301
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,260

302
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,400

303
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,220
44181.

304
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,620
And this in the background, of course, is the Jethro's from their Christmas album,

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,500
The Dark Side of the Christmas Tree.

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,060
And you can reach them at 212 and a half,

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,540
which looks sort of funny on paper.

308
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,180
212 and a half, Miller Avenue,

309
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880

313
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,080
I think that's right.

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,420
It's hard to read.

315
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,760
Jesus scribbled all over this CD.

316
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,700
And I don't know...

317
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,280
Merry Christmas, dear friends.

318
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,360
It's deep inside of all of our black holes and our black hearts.

319
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,200
We wish you happy holidays and Hanukkahs and Christmases and Kwanzas and, you know, whatever the heck you do.

320
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,560
Uh...

321
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,980
We might qualify.

Merry Christmas!

352

354

Merry Christmas!

355
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,780
Merry Christmas...

356
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm home for Christmas.

357
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,460
Walking in the winter wonderland.

358
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,080
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

359
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:44,960
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

360
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,780
What do you think?

361
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,160
Two, Santa's coming for you.

362
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,280
Three, four, you better lock your door.

363
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,020
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

364
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,220
Seven, eight, better stay up late.

365
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,620
Nine, ten, Santa's coming again!

366
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,040
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

367
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,100
Five, six, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

368
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,040
Way up north where the cold wind blows.

369
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,080
There's a little old man that you all know.

370
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,260
He's been busting his nuts the whole damn year.

371
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,340
Stamping on tools, riding his deer.

372
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,400
Come prance up, open it, say, oh, what a great book.

373
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,580
It's that time of year, guess I've got all the luck.

374
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,700
And you, Mrs. Claus, are you?

375
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,780
You ready at last?

376
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,360
I know the pole is ready.

377
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,760
I'm bumped up with gas.

378
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,740
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

379
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,820
It's your sweet boys cooking, let's get into gear.

380
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,880
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll.

381
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,040
The long-darned women's from their heads to their toes.

382
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,000
Time to pack up the sled, make that be trick.

383
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,120
No time to complain, don't give me no less.

384
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,760
They're counting on me.

385
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,880
It's Christmas time, deliver my load.

386
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,180
If I don't, it's a crime.

387
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,680
Do the corn on the field.

388
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm flying my sled.

389
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,700
Don't need no radar, I'm using my head.

390
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,460
To direct my nose to your shoes.

391
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,000
From my ticket to your fancy till the morning come.

392
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,940
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

393

It's your sweet boys cooking, let's get into gear.

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,340


396
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,540
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

397
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,980
I come down to Cheapman just once a year with my big red sack.

398
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,340
It's not a full up year, I'm gonna bring all the women lots of Christmas cheer.

399
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,460
Load it in, ready, say, it's Christmas here.

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,640
This is the story of old Saint Nick.

401
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,760
With his big red sack and his candy stick.

402
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,920
Flying back home with his beard so white.

403
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,500
He's licking that boom tang all Christmas.

404
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,040
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

405
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,100
It's your sweet boys cooking, let's get into gear.

406
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,300
Said his red sack is back in hisensitive form.

407
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,340
Gonna love them women from the head to the toe.

408
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,380
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

409
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,820
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

413
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,700
Dear friends, I don't know who this is.

414
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,240
I guess it sounds like Ventures.

415
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,280
It's from whatever old Christmas subgenius show.

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
The old Christmas subgenius show.

417
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,000
I guess this is the only new one in forever.

418
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,360
Forever?

419
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
For ever?

420
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,300
For ever and a day.

421
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,420
There's some more Jethro's in the background.

422
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,680
Frosty the Snowplow.

423
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,980
This is called.

424
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,220
Oh, I was going to give credit.

425
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,340
Santa's Big Red Sack was the swinging erudites.

426
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,160
Brother Cleve Duncan and the great Dr. Cruel on vocals there.

427
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,980
Before that, Zandy and Civet with their little Santa Claus thing.

428
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,360
And let's just listen.

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,520
And the sides are divided and divided again

542
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,600
I see so

543
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,220
Many people lonely

544
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,280
Love or hate

545
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,540
And love is all I see

546
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,220
Love or friend against friend

547
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,040
Now I'm alone

548
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,220
I'm alone

549
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,780
And now I'm never going home

550
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,780
I am a man

551
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,340
Without a country

552
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,960
And I'm a boy

553
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,480
Without a home

554
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,400
I'm a casualty of the battle of the roses and the war

555
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,420
Of the broken home

556
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,660
I believe you ​​reck in my heart

557
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,520
Of all of the troubles

558
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
So far for all nights

559
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,940
To me with God

560
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,040
I love you

561
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,640
Afrid

562
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,000
acompaña

563
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,020
Asmilan

564
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,880
As faço

565
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,880
In this life

566
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,980
Gujarat

567
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,320
Thank you.

568
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,240
Merry Christmas.

569
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,300
I don't usually do that.

570
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,520
Play rock and roll DJ.

571
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,360
I don't feel like that little children ought to be,

572
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,060
have to be exposed to all that.

573
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,480
Then was the Rainmakers.

574
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:44,340
Battle of the Roses from Good News and the Bad News.

575
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:54,000
And in my ways, Frank Marino, Mahogany Rush.

576
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,440
Little drummer boy.

577
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,140
No dang sign.

578
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,040
Jimi Hendrix.

579
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,340
And I believe Joe Satriani.

580
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,620
Merry Christmas.

581
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,880
You're spending an evening at home with your family.

582
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,500
Suddenly, without warning...

583
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,760
a сожалению.

584
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


585
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


586
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


587
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,900
Thank you for watchinginger.gsm

588
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:57,960
We'll talk soon.

589
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,960
¶¶

590
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,260
¶¶

591
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,940
¶¶

592
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,440
¶¶

593
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,220
Well, I said I wasn't going to sing,

594
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:18,380
but I have to give the post office box of Bob, friends.

595
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,060
Sometimes we forget what Christmas is all about.

596
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,760
It's about Bob, of course.

597
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,920
I mean, did Santa?

598
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,900
Blow X day for your sins, and God only knows what else.

599
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:41,420
That's Bob, friends, at post office box 140306

600
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,200
in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

601
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,120
75214.

602
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,260
I'm going to give that number again.

603
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,660
That's Bob at post office box.

604
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,540
140306, Dallas, Texas.

605
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,520
75214.

606
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,460
Ah, yes.

607
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,160
And this is the Jethro's in the background.

608
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,060
We gave their address earlier.

609
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,760
212 and a half Miller Avenue, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

610
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,040
03801.

611
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,940
And, uh, it's the holiday times.

612
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,980
Well, I guess I've probably got an old hour of slack

613
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,020
full of holiday music.

614
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,240
I'm going to have to get out of here to raise us up

615
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:37,540
out of this sad, sad, happy, wonderful situation.

616
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,200
So let's have at it, I guess.

617
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,260
It's He-Bomb.

618
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,560
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius race

619
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,700
overthrow the evil normals with new Bob Dobbs action figure

620
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,580
with rocket pilot.

621
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,260
What I wouldn't do.

622
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,940
From Bob Dobbs.

623
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,160
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you.

624
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,620
No, ooh.

625
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,960
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

626
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,400
Life support system down to zero. Cocoa.

627
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,860
Feeling spacey.

628
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,860
I have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

629
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,620
Now so chocolatey.

630
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,780
Mm, smells cocoa-licious.

631
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,180
Basically collectible.

632
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,020
Hey!

633
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,480
Smell that.

634
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,540
Oh, my God.

635
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:13,960
That's serious.

636
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:14,740
Oh, my God.

637
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,100
That's delicious.

638
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,820
Well, friends, what do you think?

639
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,060
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here,

640
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,680
or is it...

641
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,380
Go, but so what?

642
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,380
The horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

643
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,960
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures.

644
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,020
So separate.

645
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,020
So separate.

646
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,840
So separate.

647
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,020


648
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,780
So separate.

649
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,320
New.

650
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,020
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

651
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,380
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

652
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:56,380


653
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,940
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

654
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,180
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

655
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,040
We hope our little message gets to you.

656
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,880
We look up at the winter star.

657
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,580
We know that's where you are.

658
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,700
Our chimney's big and round, so you can come right down.

659
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,640
And if our wish comes true, we'll spend Christmas Eve with you.

660
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,400
Our hearts will sing with glee as we decorate the Christmas tree.

661
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,700
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

662
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,840
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

663
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,200
R2-

664
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,460
So separate.

665
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,260
So separate.

666
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,880
New from Tonka.

667
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,360
Now, you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

668
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,920
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

669
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,140
Shut up, pink boy.

670
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,020
No way.

671
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,640
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

672
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,700
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

673
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,780
I want to dance.

674
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,980
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher,

675
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,980
Janeer device, all Yaka-tisma, fighting Jesus,

676
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,440
and other action figures sold separately.

677
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,440
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

678
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,940
This toy falls apart in three days.

679
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,780
He-Bob!

680
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,620
And the bastards of the universe.

681
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,920
Too much is always better than not enough.

682
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,980
From Bob Dobbs.

683
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,080
Gorgeous.

684
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,040
We girls can blow from head to toe.

685
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,140
Like Barbie.

686
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,120
From Star Wars.

687
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,200
Story of my crazy life.

688
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,620
And casual dra awful!

689
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,760
Huh?

690
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,720
What's that?

691
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,080
Is thiske.

692
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


693
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


694
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


695
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,980
Make my pursing friends, all of you.

696
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,960
I bet that firms havin' tell ya!

697

00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,320
Bye.

699
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,440
I'm sure driving is hard.

700
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:44,540
Keep walking all out.

701
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:44,580
Say hi!

702
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,440
I need mean days so I can get some broad time.

703
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:48,500
What?

704
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:48,880
Say goodbye!

705
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,600
Why?!

706
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,620
We go signin' up at your house.

707
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,620


708
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,620


709
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,920
We'll be right back.

710
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:52,340
We'll be right back.

711
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,940
We'll be right back.

712
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,180
We'll be right back.
