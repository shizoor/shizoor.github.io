1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for our Slack.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,360
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, Living Avatar of Slack, and Saint of Saints.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,940
You have to love Bob.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,040
He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,840
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,540
He'll kill you. He'll bob you out.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,720
Though Christ was not our Savior, nor born on Christmas Day,

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,140
to save us all from atom bombs when we have gone astray.

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,180
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,640
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,980
to think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,100
Remember when you go to church, believers,

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,320
what you blame.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,280
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,860
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,180
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,560
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,080
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,820
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,000
God save ye weary citizens, for this will make ye sick.

23
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,420
That Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a stick.

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,820
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,880
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
God save ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,020
Was the St. Baphomet Neo-Pagan Reform-

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,780
no I'm sorry.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Something like that-

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,020
Let me say this right.

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,160
St. Baphomet Neo-Pagan Reformed Choir of Miskatonic University.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,580
How young I sound, Friend-

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,180
It was gonna be an official Christmas show.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah, God, I sound like a little child back then in the, back in them days.

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,540
Well.

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,820
When the promise was my show, when the atoms were placed up in aè¡£

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:07,540
friends, I, you know, I was, I was so depressed yesterday. And when I came out of it, I wrote a

39
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:14,180
wonderful rant about being depressed. And I was going to, I was going to read it to today on the

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,240
show, but then I got too depressed again. But then I remembered it's Christmas and everybody's

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,740
supposed to be depressed. And, um, and on top of that, I, it, it kind of got me off the hook

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,280
because that means that I could run the old Christmas special. Huh? Suddenly without warning.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:42,660
Yes, dear friends, I'm saved because, um, because we do have, uh, a Christmas special that I can

44
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,180
always use chunks of, uh, like that last song. And we have this new wonderful Christmas music

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,500
from Ray Brunel and the Jethro's, an entire, uh, album of,

46
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,460
uh, nothing but insane Christmas music like this heard in the background. And, uh,

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,020
oh, let's just listen because it hurts so good.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,440
Lundering through a winter fun land, dear friends. And, um, you know, what the heck,

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,880
what the heck? So it's Christmas time. It's, uh, we can, we all,

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,100
we can celebrate a religion that we don't believe in and, uh, and give presents to people we have

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,680
to give presents to. Uh, yes, isn't it? And we get to get together with our families and all our

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:50,940
family members, even those ones and all pretend to be happy and praise the birth of, uh, that first

53
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,900
Jesus guy.

54
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,240
What really went wrong? You know, cause you always have that thing in the back of your mind. Well,

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,100
gee, maybe did I screw up someplace along the line to cause this all to happen? I mean, you have to

56
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,280
bring home some evidence saying, Hey, folks, it wasn't my fault. Take a look at this picture.

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,480
You know, something happened back there.

58
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,380
I wasn't back there.

59
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,820
I am not responsible. Not for your problem, buddy. Your problem that causes you to tell me what all

60
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,400
my problems are. I'm not responsible. And if you try to make me feel like I am, then you can take

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,960
it and shove it where Bob Dobbs and his family don't care to look. Cause I didn't do it. I didn't

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
have anything to do with it. And I'm not going to feel guilty about it just cause you decided

63
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,960
somebody had to be blamed for something. No, sir, ma'am I'm on vacation. You know what I do when I'm

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,440
on vacation?

65
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,520
I work cause I'm tired of trying to work. I'm going to just work this time. I'm going to just say no to

66
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,920
play. I don't care who wants to play. If they've been my friend for 15 years, if I've been married

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,780
to him for 25 years, I don't care. I'm going to work cause that's my slack. And I just about had

68
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,280
a nervous breakdown over feeling guilty because I didn't play with everybody else enough.

69
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,100
I don't feel like you were the bad guy cause you wanted to work. Well, ironically enough, that may be

70
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,640
because you are a subgenius and the rest are pinks or else conspiracy dupes. It's the conspiracy that

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,740
said that work was supposed to be unpleasant and bad, but necessary because of the money. And it's

72
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,780
the conspiracy that said, oh, you aren't having fun or playing if you're working at what you were

73
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,320
born to do. No, you're only having fun if you're drinking and smoking dope or else at the very least

74
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,380
spending money and eating, uh,

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,720
whatever you want to call it.

76
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,320
I don't care if other people wait on you and laugh and real loud about all those other dumb people.

77
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,660
You're only having fun when you're wasting your time. Well, Bob, that stuff. And not only that,

78
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,880
but I'm going to do exactly whatever work I think needs to be done. How about them apples, huh?

79
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm not going to do the work that you think will be good and sell and make the world better in

80
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,060
some small way. Or even what Bob says I do or what A&M says I do. No, I'm going to do exactly what I

81
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,340
think is going to be good and sell.

82
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,400
And make the world better in some small way or not. Or not. I have suffered way too many fools.

83
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,480
Way too gladly for way too long. And as a result of being such a sweet, nice guy,

84
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,540
I ended up with a whole buttload of critics whining that I didn't do enough for them.

85
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,480
And with myself all balled up in a corner of the garage this morning, all by myself screaming,

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,700
leave me alone. I hate you. I hate you. Leave me alone. Let me flee at the top of my lungs and

87
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,720
with only a few words left. I'm going to do exactly what I think is right. I'm going to do exactly what I think is right.

88
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,300
only the puzzled new guard dog to hear me.

89
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,200
And I, friends, I happened to have had an appointment

90
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,940
with a shrink in the afternoon

91
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,300
because several people who are definitely crazy

92
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,480
think I'm crazy and it takes one to know one.

93
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,180
And I told the shrink about how I was starting to feel

94
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,660
like I was in an airless box

95
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,980
with all six sides closing in at once.

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,260
And she said, well, maybe you're just going to have to say no

97
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,160
to some of these people.

98
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,940
And guess what?

99
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm going to do just what the doctor said.

100
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,700
And I suggest you do too, my friend.

101
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,000
You really do know what's best for you.

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
And all those hundreds of nagging weenies and widgets

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
don't know Bob crap.

104
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,320
In fact, most of them don't even know what they want.

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,060
And that's why they're telling you what all you want.

106
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,100
And that's most people, I'm afraid.

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Most people have not the slightest idea

108
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,100
of what they want to do next

109
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,580
and are probably better off letting the boss

110
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,140
and the shrink know what they want.

111
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,140


112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,400
And they're not going to let the boss

113
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,040
and the spouse and the church

114
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,720
and the society run their lives for them.

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,640
But some of us not only have such a long list of things

116
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,220
that we want very much to do

117
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,260
so long that we know we can't possibly ever do them.

118
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,760
But we're also, believe it or not,

119
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,900
smart enough to make our own decisions.

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,940
I'm smart enough to decide right now

121
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,420
whether or not I'm going to go get drunk.

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,100
I could go get drunk right now.

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,300
And I might.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,040
I could also decide not to.

125
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,120
but screw anybody who tries to tell me.

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,080
And that especially includes the Miller Beer Company

127
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
and the Reynolds Tobacco Company

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,020
and all those Republican drug cartels

129
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,560
with their damn so-called war on drugs.

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,320
If I want to OD on heroin, I will.

131
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,080
If I want to become a cop and beat up junkies, then I will.

132
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,700
If I want to screw some willing babe in the closet,

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,960
then perhaps I damn well will.

134
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,700
And if I get caught, then I'll take my lumps.

135
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,340
But no, I won't.

136
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,980
I shouldn't have to take any lumps.

137
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,460
The only people who are going to care

138
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,560
whether some willing babe and I go do it in the closet

139
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
are the ones that can't.

140
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,180
And because, friends, as crazy as I might be

141
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,980
and as dumb as I might be,

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,180
and I often feel like the dumbest, most naive,

143
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,860
redneck, unsophisticated, just-got-in-town, clumsy subgenius,

144
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
the most horrible, horrible aspect of all this is,

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
as screwed up as I am,

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,860
I really am still saner and smarter

147
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,900
than any of the humans,

148
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,660
and you may be, too.

149
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,800
Now, that is a really chilling thought, friends.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,140
But not only must we stop trying to ignore that thought,

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
we have to start acting on it.

152
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
Or at least I do, or I really will go off my rocker.

153
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,560
So enough is enough.

154
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,040
Enough trying to be some armchair amateur's idea of good.

155
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,380
I went to the mental health professionals,

156
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,100
and they themselves agreed

157
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,800
that I am...

158
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,440
not insane,

159
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
everybody else is,

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,160
I am right to be ticked off,

161
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,840
and thousands of buttheads really are out to get me.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
So once again, I say,

163
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,520
with as much feeling as I have ever said it in my life,

164
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,440
I can't say this on the radio,

165
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,900
but it's, you know, if they can't take a joke,

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
you know what to do, friends.

167
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,880
So I'm sure you'll understand if I don't happen to

168
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,400
respond to your email this vacation,

169
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,160
or do that thing with you that you wanted to do or whatever,

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,260
don't take it personally,

171
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,780
I did, and it doesn't pay.

172
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,960
Build your own ship.

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,860
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

174
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,420
As you can see all around you, they're sparking.

175
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,080
There was a short circuit.

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,980
The brain seems to have recovered.

177
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,800
There are sparking energy thoughts all around us.

178
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,300
Far more than the normal human brain.

179
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,200
But as we know...

180
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
Another misfire there.

181
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,120
We know Doug Smith is not a normal human.

182
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,360
No, and here inside the brain of Doug Smith,

183
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,360
we can observe some of the differences that make this man

184
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
a unique leader among humans.

185
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,500
And we can see that he's a very strong man.

186
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,260
Over here in this corner are the memory bands.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,700
And over here is the main printout area.

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,780
This is the South Canada Radio Ministry.

189
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,960
Power of Land and Oil FX.

190
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,380
Praise Bob.

191
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,140
To be a good man.

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,700
To be a good man.

193
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,840
To be a good man.

194
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,820
Your source is not in the tank.

195
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,540
Your source is not in the bank.

196
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Your source is above you.

197
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:56,960


198
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,220
In another dimension, sex, in another world.

199
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,940
Oh, my, how far it can go.

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, that's a good long, long time.

201
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
Oh, sex, well, I had no intention.

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,440
Sex, not with nobody, girl.

203
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh, I tried and I tried.

204
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,640
I will, I tried.

205
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,720
I will, I tried.

206
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh, it's not with crazy men.

207
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:17,260
I will, I tried.

208
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,400
Oh, sex, well, I had no intention.

209
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,640
Sex, now in another dimension.

210
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,940
Oh, sex, well, I tried and I tried.

211
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:26,940


212
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:26,940


213
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,140
about

214
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't look at me.

215
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
I put a down payment on a small red dwarf.

216
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,620
You've got suckered, man.

217
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,520
No, it's a really small one.

218
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,300
It's just like, you know, the size of a car.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
So I was going to put it in the backyard.

220
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,540
Look, right.

221
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,820
Still, it's going to draw your entire house and most of your neighborhood right into it.

222
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,520
It's just going to be a slightly bigger red dwarf in a much smaller neighborhood.

223
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,800
Yeah, right.

224
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,980
Your neighborhood will essentially become the paint on the outside of that red dwarf.

225
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
And some of this will eventually suck the whole planet up.

226
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,040
Would it?

227
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
Or would it eventually?

228
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,720
I mean, it's only the size of a car.

229
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,060
I mean, we're not talking about a whole neutron star, right?

230
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,660
You're talking about it would still be hot.

231
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,320
A red dwarf is almost a little bit bigger than, like, you know, mass-wise than Jupiter.

232
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,840
It's like the smallest star you can create.

233
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,440
But one ounce of it weighs.

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,580
A ton.

235
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,180
No, no, that's a neutron.

236
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,940
Oh.

237
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,840
A neutron star.

238
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,460
One tablespoon weighs as much as the largest mountain on the Earth.

239
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,380
One tablespoon of neutron matter.

240
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,520
I've got, like, a gram of that hanging from my...

241
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,140
Well, I don't want to...

242
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,060
It's a trendy piercing thing.

243
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,740
Well, yeah, we used to snort it back in the disco days.

244
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,580
Snorting neutron star matter?

245
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,060
Yeah.

246
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, God, how could you see in the next day?

247
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,600
It seems like you'd be, you know, in the bathroom.

248
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
It would just be...

249
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,660
It would be so hard to keep.

250
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,040
Yeah, you'd almost have to wear lead diapers or something.

251
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah, very reinforced.

252
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,420
Well, it'd only take a little bit.

253
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,640
It's just like not even a match head full.

254
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,400
But a match head full weighs as much as, you know, a couple of semis.

255
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,540
Oh, yeah, at least.

256
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,420
Yeah, people don't...

257
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,400
We're not just jabbering inanely.

258
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,340
There are neutrons.

259
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,100
There are really such things as neutron stars out there in space that are collapsed.

260
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,980
Right.

261
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,760
Old stars that have all the...

262
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,500
Massive stars collapsing the size of, like, New York City.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, there's no...

264
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,460
What is it?

265
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,980
I guess they're...

266
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,600
All the forces.

267
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,940
They're all neutron, right?

268
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,500
They're just the energyless atom core.

269
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,460
Right.

270
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,020
They're all in together.

271
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,080
And the only thing keeping them from just collapsing down to nothing...

272
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Nothing.

273
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,480
Nothing.

274
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,180
I think they're down to the last force there.

275
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,800
The weak nuclear force.

276
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah, they're just so tight.

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,640
They're so tight-packed.

278
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,020
Can't get nothing in there.

279
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,060
Add just a little more matter to it and it'll disappear.

280
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
Dear friends, well, I bet if there...

282
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,740
I bet you could get in there if there was hair around it.

283
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

284
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,260
Friends, I almost forgot it was Christmas.

285
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,480
But I have to give credit there for that ESO.

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,700
Wonderful Einstein Secret Orchestra song, sax.

287
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,700

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,900
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

290
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
And Bob Mosick on drums.

291
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,580
Here is the address of Einstein Secret Orchestra,

292
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,580
who we also heard on that little radio clip afterwards.

293
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,220
ESO P.O. Box.

294
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,540
81555.

295
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,800
That's P.O. Box 81555.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,880
Cleveland, Ohio.

297
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,980
Cleveland, Ohio.

298
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
Backwards, that's...

299
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,260
Y-hole DNA level C.

300
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,560
Zip code 44181.

301
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,260

302
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,400

303
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,220
44181.

304
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,620
And this in the background, of course, is the Jethro's from their Christmas album,

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,500
The Dark Side of the Christmas Tree.

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,060
And you can reach them at 212 and a half,

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,540
which looks sort of funny on paper.

308
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,180
212 and a half, Miller Avenue,

309
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880

313
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,080
I think that's right.

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,420
It's hard to read.

315
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,760
Jesus scribbled all over this CD.

316
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,700
And I don't know...

317
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,280
Merry Christmas, dear friends.

318
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,360
It's deep inside of all of our black holes and our black hearts.

319
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,200
We wish you happy holidays and Hanukkahs and Christmases and Kwanzas and, you know, whatever the heck you do.

320
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,560
Uh...

321
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,980
We might qualify.

Merry Christmas...

356
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm home for Christmas.

357
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,460
Walking in the winter wonderland.

358
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,080
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

359
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:44,960
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

360
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,780
What do you think?

361
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,160
Two, Santa's coming for you.

362
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,280
Three, four, you better lock your door.

363
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,020
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

364
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,220
Seven, eight, better stay up late.

365
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,620
Nine, ten, Santa's coming again!

366
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,040
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

367
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,100
Five, six, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

368
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,040
Way up north where the cold wind blows.

369
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,080
There's a little old man that you all know.

370
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,260
He's been busting his nuts the whole damn year.

371
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,340
Stamping on tools, riding his deer.

372
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,400
Come prance up, open it, say, oh, what a great book.

373
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,580
It's that time of year, guess I've got all the luck.

374
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,700
And you, Mrs. Claus, are you?

375
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,780
You ready at last?

376
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,360
I know the pole is ready.

377
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,760
I'm bumped up with gas.

378
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,740
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

379
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,820
It's your sweet boys cooking, let's get into gear.

380
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,880
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll.

381
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,040
The long-darned women's from their heads to their toes.

382
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,000
Time to pack up the sled, make that be trick.

383
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,120
No time to complain, don't give me no less.

384
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,760
They're counting on me.

385
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,880
It's Christmas time, deliver my load.

386
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,180
If I don't, it's a crime.

387
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,680
Do the corn on the field.

388
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm flying my sled.

389
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,700
Don't need no radar, I'm using my head.

390
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,460
To direct my nose to your shoes.

391
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,000
From my ticket to your fancy till the morning come.

392
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,940

It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

397
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,980
I come down to Cheapman just once a year with my big red sack.

398
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,340
It's not a full up year, I'm gonna bring all the women lots of Christmas cheer.

399
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,460
Load it in, ready, say, it's Christmas here.

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,640
This is the story of old Saint Nick.

401
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,760
With his big red sack and his candy stick.

402
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,920
Flying back home with his beard so white.

403
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,500
He's licking that boom tang all Christmas.

404
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,040
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

405
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,100
It's your sweet boys cooking, let's get into gear.

406
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,300
Said his red sack is back in hisensitive form.

407
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,340
Gonna love them women from the head to the toe.

408
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,380
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

409

Dear friends, I don't know who this is.

414
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,240
I guess it sounds like Ventures.

415
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,280
It's from whatever old Christmas subgenius show.

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
The old Christmas subgenius show.

417
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,000
I guess this is the only new one in forever.

418
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,360
Forever?

419
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
For ever?

420
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,300
For ever and a day.

421
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,420
There's some more Jethro's in the background.

422
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,680
Frosty the Snowplow.

423
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,980
This is called.

424
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,220
Oh, I was going to give credit.

425
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,340
Santa's Big Red Sack was the swinging erudites.

Brother Cleve Duncan and the great Dr. Cruel on vocals there.

427

Before that, Zandy and Civet with their little Santa Claus thing.

428
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,360

537
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,200
Of the broken home

538
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,100
guitar solo

539
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,200
Oh, I see land

540
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,720
Oh, divided down the middle

541
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,520
And the sides are divided and divided again

542
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,600
I see so

543
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,220
Many people lonely

544
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,280
Love or hate

545
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,540
And love is all I see

546
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,220
Love or friend against friend

547
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,040
Now I'm alone

548
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,220
I'm alone

549
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,780
And now I'm never going home

550
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,780
I am a man

551
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,340
Without a country

552
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,960
And I'm a boy

553
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,480
Without a home

554
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,400
I'm a casualty of the battle of the roses and the war

555
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,420
Of the broken home

556
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,660
I believe you ââreck in my heart

557
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,520
Of all of the troubles

558
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
So far for all nights

559
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,940
To me with God

560
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,040
I love you

561
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,640
Afrid

562
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,000
acompaÃ±a

563
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,020
Asmilan

564
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,880
As faÃ§o

565
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,880
In this life

566
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,980
Gujarat

567
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,320
Thank you.

568
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,240
Merry Christmas.

569
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,300
I don't usually do that.

570
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,520
Play rock and roll DJ.

571
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,360
I don't feel like that little children ought to be,

572
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,060
have to be exposed to all that.

573
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,480
Then was the Rainmakers.

574
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:44,340
Battle of the Roses from Good News and the Bad News.

575
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:54,000
And in my ways, Frank Marino, Mahogany Rush.

576
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,440
Little drummer boy.

577
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,140
No dang sign.

578
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,040
Jimi Hendrix.

579
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,340
And I believe Joe Satriani.

580
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,620
Merry Christmas.

581
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,880
You're spending an evening at home with your family.

582
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,500
Suddenly, without warning...

583
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,760
a ÑÐ¾Ð¶Ð°Ð»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ.

584
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


585
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


586
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,780


587
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:57,900
Thank you for watchinginger.gsm

588
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:57,960
We'll talk soon.

589
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,960
Â¶Â¶

590
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,260
Â¶Â¶

591
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,940
Â¶Â¶

592
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,440
Â¶Â¶

593
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,220
Well, I said I wasn't going to sing,

594
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:18,380
but I have to give the post office box of Bob, friends.

595
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,060
Sometimes we forget what Christmas is all about.

596
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,760
It's about Bob, of course.

597
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,920
I mean, did Santa?

598
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,900
Blow X day for your sins, and God only knows what else.

599
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:41,420
That's Bob, friends, at post office box 140306

600
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,200
in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

601
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,120
75214.

602
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,260
I'm going to give that number again.

603
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,660
That's Bob at post office box.

604
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,540
140306, Dallas, Texas.

605
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,520
75214.

606
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,460
Ah, yes.

607
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,160
And this is the Jethro's in the background.

608
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,060
We gave their address earlier.

609
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,760
212 and a half Miller Avenue, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

610
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,040
03801.

611
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,940
And, uh, it's the holiday times.

612
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,980
Well, I guess I've probably got an old hour of slack

613
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,020
full of holiday music.

614
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,240
I'm going to have to get out of here to raise us up

615
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:37,540
out of this sad, sad, happy, wonderful situation.

616
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,200
So let's have at it, I guess.

617
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,260
It's He-Bomb.

618
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,560
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius race

619
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,700
overthrow the evil normals with new Bob Dobbs action figure

620
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,580
with rocket pilot.

621
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,260
What I wouldn't do.

622
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,940
From Bob Dobbs.

623
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,160
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you.

624
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,620
No, ooh.

625
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,960
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

626
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,400
Life support system down to zero. Cocoa.

627
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,860
Feeling spacey.

628
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,860
I have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

629
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,620
Now so chocolatey.

630
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,780
Mm, smells cocoa-licious.

631
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,180
Basically collectible.

632
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,020
Hey!

633
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,480
Smell that.

634
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,540
Oh, my God.

635
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:13,960
That's serious.

636
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:14,740
Oh, my God.

637
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,100
That's delicious.

638
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,820
Well, friends, what do you think?

639
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,060
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here,

640
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,680
or is it...

641
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,380
Go, but so what?

642
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,380
The horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

643
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,960
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures.

644
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,020
So separate.

645
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,020
So separate.

646
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,840
So separate.

647
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,020


648
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,780
So separate.

649
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,320
New.

650
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,020
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

651
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,380
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

652
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:56,380


653
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,940
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

654
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,180
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

655
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,040
We hope our little message gets to you.

656
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,880
We look up at the winter star.

657
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,580
We know that's where you are.

658
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,700
Our chimney's big and round, so you can come right down.

659
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,640
And if our wish comes true, we'll spend Christmas Eve with you.

660
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,400
Our hearts will sing with glee as we decorate the Christmas tree.

661
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,700
R2-D2, we wish you a merry Christmas.

662
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,840
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

663
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,200
R2-

664
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,460
So separate.

665
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,260
So separate.

666
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,880
New from Tonka.

667
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,360
Now, you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

668
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,920
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

669
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,140
Shut up, pink boy.

670
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,020
No way.

671
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,640
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

672
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,700
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

673
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,780
I want to dance.

674
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,980
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher,

675
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,980
Janeer device, all Yaka-tisma, fighting Jesus,

676
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,440
and other action figures sold separately.

677
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,440
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

678
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,940
This toy falls apart in three days.

679
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,780
He-Bob!

680
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,620
And the bastards of the universe.

681
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,920
Too much is always better than not enough.

682
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,980
From Bob Dobbs.

683
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,080
Gorgeous.

684
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,040
We girls can blow from head to toe.

685
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,140
Like Barbie.

686
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,120
From Star Wars.

687
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,200
Story of my crazy life.

688
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,620
And casual dra awful!

689
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,760
Huh?

690
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,720
What's that?

691
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,080
Is thiske.

692
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


693
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


694
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


695
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,980
Make my pursing friends, all of you.

696
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,960
I bet that firms havin' tell ya!

697
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,540
She's pefect.

698
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,320
Bye.

699
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,440
I'm sure driving is hard.

700
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:44,540
Keep walking all out.

701
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:44,580
Say hi!

702
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,440
I need mean days so I can get some broad time.

703
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:48,500
What?

704
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:48,880
Say goodbye!

705
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,600
Why?!

706
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,620
We go signin' up at your house.

707
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,620


708
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,620


709
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,920
We'll be right back.

710
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:52,340
We'll be right back.

711
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,940
We'll be right back.

712
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,180
We'll be right back.
