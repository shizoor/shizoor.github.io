Here, look.
Yeah?
Just look around.
The smart money knows the truth.
Fucker.
I'm getting on the ground floor.
The Soul Genius.
Power of Swag.
Have you looked at them?
Crooks, gangsters, bums, hobos, drunks, and I don't know what.
They are a little picturesque, aren't they?
But what kind of a society are you going to start with them?
Snobbish, are you?
To make a decent place, you need bums and alcoholics and criminals.
Oh, well, I guess so.
This tape is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.
The Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject for every Christian to study,
to help you better understand current events, to put things in perspective,
and most importantly, to help you have that inner peace of knowing
that God...
God...
is on His throne and in control.
Uh, I'd like to go to the lake and...
And a month of peace will be introduced.
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.
Someone with a lot of energy.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Okay, your code number once more?
237.
237, and you're calling from Dallas.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Hi, you're on Hotline.
You can start...
Yes, my code number is...
Amen.
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.
Praise the Lord.
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.
Amen.
They're going to get worse and worse.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!











Hey!






Hey!


Doctors warn.
It's going to be a sad time, amen, when Jesus comes back.
If we're not walking by the same rules and minding the same things.
So many people are confused about it and got their own theory about the way they see the Word of God.
But I...
All the signs point to serious health damage.
All the signs point to thousands and thousands and thousands of cancers and birth deformities and miscarriages and awful health problems.
Both sides will be destroyed regardless of who starts it.
The minute you have another war, there's not going to be any war left, I don't think.
Because we're going to blow one another to pieces.
Peace on earth.
Peace on earth.
Peace on earth.
P-O-E.
Purity of essence.
I give my vote for Jesus and I thank God for you and Brother Robinson.
Because in this day and time, we don't know what we're going to come to.
Are you familiar with the government prepared cancer maps?
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.
And as soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.
I don't think anybody would know what to do.
Even possibly the President.
So we're still going to be hiding this stuff underground.
I personally feel that the President of the United States is evading the issue of hazardous waste in America today.
I can't really play the guitar very well.
Or sing.

I pulled that funny feeling by Bo Burnham off YouTube at the suggestion of Reverend Blackout.
Good suggestion because it fits perfectly into the theme of this hour of Slack number 1849,
The End of the World, also known as Subgenius Media Barrage at number four.
Some of our Media Barrage albums,
from the early 1980s, are on CD or streaming,
but Media Barrage number four stayed on tape since 1981
and is basically unheard by modern so-called audiences.
When this was edited on reel-to-reel tape, largely by me,
there were only about 273 known subgeniuses.
This episode will be a mix of the very old
with the just-finished,
because we have two more recent original songs coming up
that probably haven't been broadcast much before.
But let's plunge into the toxic radioactive swamp
that is our future,
as prophesied in Subgenius Media Barrage tape number four.
He's with Wonder Woman and her incredible powers of strength and agility.
At six, it's Kirk Spock and the crew of the Starship Enterprise.
The only cult they want to talk about is the Subgenius Foundation,
the Church of the Subgenius,
and the only reason they talk about it is for the money.
We're going to go to the phones right now.
Good evening, you're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond
and the Reverend Arnold Stang, Ivan Stang.
I have a question for Mr. Drummond.
Yes, go ahead.
Are you Mr. Drummond?
That's right.
I'm calling from Dallas.
What's your question?
Well, do you work on spiritual problems or do you just work on wallets?
We will help you out.

We will help you out spiritually, of course.
It helps if we can have some financial assistance.
We sell $10 memberships.
And once you start getting our newsletter,
you start receiving lessons on how to conduct your life
in the most beneficial way for both you and us.
Perhaps you've been deceived by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.
He's gone, and the world is waiting for who?
Well, the world's not believers entirely.
They're waiting for the Antichrist.
They don't know they are.
But who's going to come in 10 days but the one who says to Israel,
you need protection?
As we said, have made the club and...
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
May I speak to Reverend Stang?
Oh, yeah.
You got me?
Reverend Stang?
Right.
Yeah.
I called to ask, as far as your belief is concerned,
are you a Christian and do you believe in God and the Bible?
We believe in everything.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
The reason I asked is I was intrigued by what you brought out
about using the word conspiracy and I was wondering if you believed
in the fact that Jesus Christ is saved yesterday, today, and forever,
and do you believe that he still has a truth?
Do you believe that he's going to come back?


I mean, I think the truth pops in these last days and he did in Moses and Elijah.
Well, I'll tell you what.
We've been, in the course of our research, we've been getting a whole lot of stuff in
the mail about the Second Coming.
A lot of other cults are talking about the Second Coming and how Jesus is going to come
back or sometimes it goes by other names, that Christ is going to come back.
And the main thing that the Subgenius Foundation has to say about that is beware of cheap imitations.
There are a lot of false prophets running around right now and a lot of people that
are, in the next 20 or 30 years, there are going to be a lot of people trying to convince
you that they are Jesus back on earth.
Oh, yes.
I've, as a born-again Christian, I've seen that in the Spirit, too.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
I'll make a peace agreement with you.
The only reason America still stands is there's a remnant of Christians who are still praying
for a spiritual awakening in this world.
The Church of the Living God is preaching and believing and looking for the coming
of Jesus Christ.
There is a way out.
There is an escape route.
This world is destined for destruction.
It's doomed and it's damned according to the Word of God.
But Jesus is coming for a Church.
He's going to get His bride out of this world.
Point one.
I am tonight.
I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States.

Sooner or later.
To get there sooner, fly Iran Air.
Only Iran Air flies from New York to Tehran non-stop.
You arrive in the afternoon in time for dinner and a good night's sleep.
You wake up refreshed.
On other airlines you arrive after dark, often much later.
Fly to Tehran the fastest way on Iran Air.
Try the urgent way to fly.
The best way is to see the sky.

Iran Air is rolling your way.
Remember, you're only one stop from London, Paris or Tehran on Iran Air.

And you get there just once.
There is the other highway coming your way.

There are some 50,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.
I think we really need nuclear weapons because Russia and everybody else has got them.
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming and the end of the age.
And one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.
This hasn't taken place yet.
Just don't buy your doomsday theory.
Well, you better buy it.
We are in worse shape from the point of view of our military preparedness than we were on the 8th of December 1941, the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Russians got the definite advantage on us right now.
We need to show more strength.
We got to catch up and get ahead of them or we're dead meat.
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the earth in his day and that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place, that a great cataclysmic,
judgment will do that very thing.
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982, but we don't know what day it'll happen.
This article was referring, as I said, to the nine planets in our solar system, Mercury, Earth, Mars, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Neptune.
When these are scheduled to be perfectly aligned in 1982, that these things perhaps can happen.
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen would have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place.
Resulting that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication and a great deal more.
I see that I'm not going to have much time to go into this anymore today.
And so I'm going to carry it through tomorrow and try to bring it to a to a more clear climax.
But may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us to repent of our sins and to get ready for the coming of the Lord.
For we can see great and drastic things that are going to take place on the earth when Jesus comes and the judgments of God are being poured out upon a Christ rejecting man.

It's coming to you about the prelude to Armageddon and also some of the strange events that have been forecasted for 1982.
Some of the things that are coming in these last days.
Hey, you know, the future is a magnetic place.
Each year 100 billion are born into it.
Why, it seems all roads lead to tomorrow.
Why, just looking at the future isn't chatting.
I was the long conveyor belt where all inspiring holograms are as much a part of the experience of every man.
As for the.
the real trees, mountains and sunsets of the dark past.
It's thrilling to wander amidst these realistic 3D images,
and you'll certainly feel at home,
since the leaders here have chosen the architecture of the mediocritons of the middle class ages
as the most relaxing and appeasing of all art forms.
It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises,
or power plants and office buildings,
which might suddenly change to lovely forests and pastures.
But wherever you go, you're still amidst the clean, ever-changing holograms of the future,
made possible by the amazing hologram projectors
and the careful planning of the folks behind the scenes.
And it won't put a dent in your budget,
since holograms are produced in economical black and white.
You might even get to see a rare hologram eclipse
when your real surroundings become enjoyably apparent.
We are holidaying in technical difficulties.
Please do not...
You can't see it all.
You can't even be sure you're seeing any of it.
You and I are scientific men.
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.
Now just think.
Less than a month ago, Santa Mera was like any other town.
People with nothing but problems.
Then out of the sky came a solution.
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmer's field.
From the seeds came pods,
which have the power to reach the sky.
They reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.
Your new bodies are growing in there.
They're taking you over.
Cell for cell.
Atom for atom.
There's no pain.
Suddenly, while you're asleep,
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories,
and you're reborn into an untroubled world.
Forever used to sleep.
Exactly.
What a world.
We're not the last humans left.
They'll destroy you.
Tomorrow you won't want them to.
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.
I don't want any part of you.
You're forgetting something, Miles.
What's that?
You have no choice.
And our children will live, Mr. Beale,
to see that...
...perfect life.
A perfect world...
...in which there's no war or famine,
oppression or brutality.
One vast and ecumenical holding company,
for whom all men will work to serve a common profit,
in which all men will hold a share of stock,
all necessities provided,

Ah, the funny sketch.
Thank you. Do you like that?
Yeah. No, but it was a funny sketch.
You talk about young people in America.
I don't recognize them. I don't think they exist.
I think your kind creates them.
You force them into little molds
and pop them out like little plastic figures off a production line.
You stuff them full of preconceived ideas,
praise them for turning out so well.
But they're not people, they're machines.
Then you wind them up like little tape recorders
and send them out into the world
to spread another generation of love.
This is the best of all possible worlds.
This is a recording.
Quiet, angels.
I'm gonna pass one more miracle.
And you gotta help me.
In case it's a new kind of miracle.
In my own image, let there be man.
Sure, we gave second thoughts to pacing over the earth, but...
Well, like cement's not very biodegradable.
Biodegradable.
And we had enough of it down already,
we figured we may as well go ahead and pave over the rest.
It's a lot easier than tearing all this up.
We could air condition and it got rid of the bugs.
I don't know, it's just a lot easier to keep things clean.
I mean, we got air conditioning,
toilet training for all our children.
We've got all the rocks we could chew on.
But you don't need nature for beauty.
The buildings here are inspiring monuments to our adaptable workers.
Such as the enchanting shopping metroplexes.
During Let's Go Shopping, a 20 minute break and a 20 hour workday,
humans compete to consume as much as possible.
And all it costs is time.
What husband could resist letting his wife have us free for free?
And there's sure no trouble deciding what you want.
Oh, don't buy me.
Nobody wants me.
I used to be popular, but not no more.
Hey, man, you wanna buy me?
All of that's been bought by all of you.
Besides, he only costs five minutes.
And when shopping time is up,
all the products you've just bought are flushed away down to the factories
to be recycled and back on the shelves by tomorrow.
It's even tattered looking inside.
Remember, no more people

It's even sadder on the inside.
A nice break from the old media barrage there by our young friend Reverend Negative
and the late, great Reverend Jones.
Just John, who boarded the Saucers last year, or earlier this year. Actually, I think Just John
started that piece and Reverend Negative added to it. I used several very weird and cool-sounded
pieces of Just John's music on my microbe porn videos of 2009 or so, which are on my YouTube
channel. He was fairly old, but his death seemed sudden. There's been a lot of that going around.
Anyway, on a cheerier note, back to Media Barrage number four.
You can take those records and run them backwards and you can hear Satan talking on there. So I want
you to realize that we're in a crooked and diverse nation. When I see and read and hear on the
internet, I see and hear on the internet, I see and hear on the internet, I see and hear on the

news that 65% of our teenage girls in school today become pregnant and the other just happen
not to get caught. Well, then I know we're in a crooked and diverse nation. The judgments of God
is going to fall upon this nation. An angel come and stood right over my head and I heard that
angel singing. There's a nation that stands in the judgment. There is a nation that has for
gotten God. Sin is the great. Sin is a space. It stands in disgrace. America has forgotten God.
If you love Bob, come with me. Yes, that was a wonderful number by our orchestra organist,
Raymond Price, here on the Bob Hour.
Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're glad to have you here.
My wife, Zelma.

Did you tell him about Bob?
Okay, sit, sit down, everybody.
Can you hear me? Can you hear me out there?
Yeah, yeah, I think it's time for a song. Ladies and gentlemen, do you want to hear a song?
Cromp his ass. Kill him. Goon squad. Fucking know it normal, goddamn.
Well, we've done it. We've let loose the dogs of war.
I wonder how...
I better come and kill them or they'll destroy us.

You two act like it was the end of the world.
Well, it could be.
But we will return to enjoy your final moment.
Your commentator, Jonathan Mathias, with another bulletin.
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war continues to rapidly escalate,
U.S. authorities are beginning to question to what degree we will become involved
in what could swiftly grow into global conflict.
Abort firings! Abort firings!
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.
Repeat, abort firings! Abort firings!
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.
Tonight's presentation on the beach was, of course, fiction.
All Americans share the common desire
that a nuclear holocaust will never happen.
And certainly an alert, prepared America
is our greatest safeguard in a nuclear age.
I really don't know, because I don't know the situation
neither does the American people.
Our current policy is that we do not launch until we are under attack.
Now, the danger of that policy today is
the Soviets can deliver their missiles with such accuracy
that they'll be able to knock out in a matter of relatively few seconds
all of our ability to retaliate against the rest of the Soviet Union.
Soviet missiles.
Range two miles. Missile still deflecting.
Range one mile. Missile detonated.
Hold! Hold! Hold!
If a true alarm sounded, most of our defenses would be alerted
and within ten minutes, many of our jets would be in flight,
headed for their targets.
Yet under existing law, only the president could give the final order
to fire our nuclear warheads.
... airborne at the time.
As part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.
Now, it appears that the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia
with an average load of 40 megatons each.
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand.
I was under the impression that I was the only one in authority
to order the use of nuclear weapons.
That's right, sir.
You are the only person authorized to do so.
And although I, uh, hate to judge before all the facts are in,
it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.
My little 11-year-old child, I think his, uh, mentality is much more alert than this 16-year-old boy.
The point is, uh, stupidity is all around us, and, uh...
it's not worth getting upset about, you know.
It is not a thing a sane man would do.
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.
But surely you can disarm it somehow?
No. It is designed to explode if it's not destroyed. But they are not going to know that it's not destroyed.
if any attempt is ever made to un-trigger it automatically.
It's an obvious commie trick, Mr. President.
We're wasting valuable time.
Look at the big water.
We're getting ready to clobber.
Is money more important than people's lives?
And in their pursuit for private interests,
a lot of chemical companies will not accept legal
or even moral responsibility for the results of chemical waste pollution
until absolute proof shows that a specific chemical
from a specific plant caused a specific disease.
The treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants,
it's frequently frustrating,
and to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Breco.
Well, I'll tell you what, everything I figure is a hazard.
It progresses as the years go on,
and eventually we'll never be able to control it.
If you take a look at those maps
that show concentrations of various forms of cancer,
that you can pick out the industrialized areas
of the world.
Are you trying to drive me crazy?
You've obviously never heard of Cabal Thorium-G.
No, what about it?
Cabal Thorium-G has a radioactive half-life of 93 years.
If you take, say, 50 H-bombs in the 100 megaton range
and jacket them with Cabal Thorium-G,
when they are exploded, they will produce a doomsday shroud,
a lethal cloud of radioactive...
activity which will encircle the Earth for 93 years.
What a load of crap.
No question, we have a problem.
We all know that.
But that doesn't mean that we ought to change the whole system we have,
find out where the problems are,
the character of the problems, and address them.
All I want is some help.
I don't want to be sitting out here and forgotten with poison water.
That's all I ask is for some help.
The state of Michigan says there's nothing wrong with it.
But EPA came out and said there is something wrong.
The Health Department of Michigan later sends me a letter saying,
it's all right, there's nothing wrong with your water, you can drink it.
And if you don't think that doesn't scare a mother to find out that a boy has
urinary tear blood, when you know he's only got one kidney,
believe me, I've had it.
I cried all the way to the doctor's office.
The American Heart Association has been working to help the children and adults with kidney problems.


And I'm heading every road.
There are new thoughts, ready and waiting to explode.
When tomorrow is today, the bells may toll for some,
but nothing can change the shape of things to come.
Certain changes have been taking place here,
such as the increase in the,
beatnik crowd,
and the increase of the drugs that's used and distributed by the beatniks.
One thing, friend,
that can save America, and that's change every person one at a time
by the power of Almighty God working in that corrupt heart.
The gates of hell was government.
Because in Bible times, government sat at the gates of the city.
Yes.
The Bible says the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.
There's no question about it.
We are going to see the most tremendous turn of events.
Not only in this nation, it's going to affect the whole world.
Peace, did Hitler say.
Next move, Czechoslovakia.
There are a few beatniks in Berkeley.
I'm sure from what you folks hear,
you would think that the population in Berkeley
is really becoming beatnik-like all the time.
Well, the percentage of them is increasing a bit.
But with this movie actor getting into the governor's chair,
Ronald Regan from Hollywood,
I think that he's going to tame them down a little bit.
May I close up?
We've got two minutes of silence on a personal note.
I was asked once in a press interview
what book I would choose if I were shipwrecked on an island
and could have only one book for the rest of my life.
I replied that I knew of only one book
that could be read and reread
and continue to be a challenge.
The Bible.
The Old and New Testaments.
I can only add to that, my friends,
that I continue to look to the scriptures today
day for fulfillment and for guidance. Indeed, it is an incontrovertible fact that all the complex
and horrendous questions confronting us at home and worldwide have their answer in that single book.
God gave us a purpose. God put us here for some reason. Everything that we do here is aimed at the next world or it ought not to be done.
You who are pastors who have been chosen by God Almighty to lead, we are talking about Christianizing America.
Amen.
We are talking about Christianizing America.

We are talking about simply spreading the gospel in a political context.

If not for rape and incest, would there be any population left?
Steve King.
She was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute.
Students should show up in proper attire.
Kathleen Pasadomo said this about an 11-year-old girl gang-raped in Texas.
If a woman has the right to an abortion, why shouldn't a man be able to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?
At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't in most cases result in anyone's death.
Lawrence Lachman.
What is the value of that life, and is it subordinate to the value of its host body?
Jose Oliva.
My friend, God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew,
for how in the world can God hear the prayer of a Jew?
The prayer of a man who says Jesus Christ is not the true Messiah.
It is blasphemous.
We need to bring the world to the foot of the cross.
And we have been dealing with and showing who these people were,
and telling you that they were representatives of all the 12 tribes of Israel
who were, without a question, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic,
uh,

kindred peoples.
Because that's the true Israel of the Bible.
That's who the true, true Israel of the Bible is.
I shall go down in history as the greatest German.
In your word, you have said all no-whites, meaning all non-whites, I suppose, are Satan's children.
You have said that they are devil worshipers who feed their children to crocodiles,
which makes you sound like a white Muslim.
Well, whatever it makes me sound like, sir, these things that I base the arguments upon the difference of race,
uh, is from a biblical standpoint.
They're not associated with him.
We like to think of ourselves as the, uh, the ultimate minority.
The subgeniuses. The, uh,
final organization.
The most understood minority.
They don't take us seriously, and rightfully so.
What happens if they cross us?
You know? Uh, maybe we pray or something.
But most often we don't know about it.
We'll learn this until the Lord himself comes back and rescues all of us.
All right, cut him off.
Leave him on.
Am I still on the air?
If this is how he wants to go out, this is how he goes.
I don't know how to say it, except that I just went out of bullshit.
Yeah. Uh, look, Mr. Schumacher's right here. Do you want to talk to him?
Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living.
And if we can't think of any reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit.
Oh, my God.
We don't know about all this pointless pain, humiliation, and decay.
We don't know about all this pointless pain, humiliation, and decay.

So there better be someone somewhere who does know.
That's the God bullshit.
He's saying that life is bullshit, and it is.
So what are you screaming about?
Man is a noble creature that's flawed to his own world.
Who needs God?
Well, if there's anybody out there that can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in
and tell me that man is a noble creature...
Believe me, that man is full of bullshit.
Believe me, that man is full of bullshit.
What's so goddamn funny?
I can't help it, Herman. It's funny.
I don't have anything, thanks.
This is going out live today.
I don't have any chits.
Leave him on.
And I was married for 33 years of shrill, shrieking fraud.
Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you.
Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.
So I don't have any bullshit left.
I just ran out of it, you see.
And they though he was fuckingels for every woman in Black Panther.
Those men are coming up for me.



So, do you know what...
What?
From do America wants to know.
You-
Who do you mean?
I frown.
For a lonely telecast
Scan the sky
Hail the stars
Hey nice try
It's too far
Take the best of what we are
Aim it at some distant star
Post a selfie to the void
Of the world that we destroyed
Endless night
No one hears
Flash of light
Disappears
Scan the sky
Hail the stars
Hey nice try
It's too far
Take the best of what we are

Endless night
No one hears
Flash of light
Disappears
The name of that song was
The Big Selfie
The Big Selfie
And it certainly depicts
The sense of hopelessness
Until X Day Comes
That was done by
David Morrison
Who occasionally sends me
Cool songs he's recorded
And this one was mixed
By the Rudy Schwartz Project
It sounds pretty rich
In my hearing aids
But now back to Media Barrage 4
Which includes cuts
From the first times
That Dr. Drummond and I
Were guests on Dallas radio shows
It's a dream






We are talking
With Reverend Ivan Stang
And the good Dr. Philo Drummond
From the Church of the Subgenius
And guys we've been getting
A lot of phone calls
That people do not think
You guys are real
Well we're dead serious
This is all too real George
It really is
I mean you have stacks
Of pamphlets here
Some incredible reading matter
That can be had at a song
We just want to emphasize
That if you call in
We'll give you the
Post office box number
And for a mere dollar
Something you would drop
Out of your pocket
And not even worry
About picking up
You can get more reading matter
Than you could read
In two days time
And even then
You wouldn't comprehend it all
Ten years from now
Our pamphlets
Will take the place
Of federal reserve currency
That might be
That might be
The way things have been going
You can get those pieces of paper
That Bob sends from P.O. Box
I'm going to read that number again
To you folks
P.O. Box
8-0-7
Glen Rose, Texas
76043
You can leave off the zip code
But send that dollar
That's right
And we'll return to you
This tiny, tiny
Little book
That we call it
It's called
The World Ends Tomorrow
And You May Die
And that donation
If I may say
Solely goes to cover
The cost of printing
And mailing
That's exactly right
We only use that dollar
To fight the conspiracy
With their own
With their own weapon
I mean we're fighting
Fire with fire
And that dollar
It's sure it's buying some paper
But it ain't the paper
That you're getting
It ain't the words you're reading
That's important
It's the feeling
It's the power
That comes out of Bob
You're here right now
For the power of a miracle
God drives that tumor out
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power
For the power



We're on the air with
Uh...
Mr. Opinion
And the founders
Of the Subgenius Foundation
Well Mr. Opinion
Uh...
I want to talk to the founders
Yes
I think this is uh...
Uh...
This is terrific
Now this is what we need
Well thank you
Ma'am we feel that people out there
Have had about all they can stand
And it's up to us
To finally do something about it
I think so
And I have a billion dollars
That I haven't been using
And I thought maybe
Now where do we want to go
To uh...
Establish all this
Uh...
Well with your billion dollars
You can either buy
A billion uh...
Pamphlets from us
Which you can
You can also pick those up
By the way
At Earth Base Bookstore
At Oak Lawn and Lemon
And uh...
At a place called
Remember When
Or you could uh...
Also buy your own
Church of the Subgenius
Uh...
Clench all your own
And uh...
Push your head up
And out of the way
And out of the way
And out of the way
And out of the way


And out of the way





Well isn't it also true
That the Klan has a
Money making system
Of a few people at the top
And they make these people
Buy these sheets
And they're now more
Of an elaborate robe
And it's a pretty
Money making scheme
It is not true
And I bet you can feel that warm
That warm feeling
Building up in your wallet
Yeah
Can you feel the Bob energy
Coming through your wallet
Yes it makes those
Little dollars
Gonna chop
Jump right out of your back pocket
And help Bob
So I think uh...
I think now that we've got a very large congregation here,
we ought to go around and ask people just what Bob has done for you.
I want you to think about what...
Just make a quick testimonial, a short testimonial,
about what Bob has done since he came into your life.
Swami?
Well...
Oh, here we...
No, I ain't coming, sir.
Well, I had some impure thoughts this weekend.
Oh, I understand.
And, well, I soiled the bed sheets last night,
and I think that Bob definitely had a hand in that somewhere.
Oh, friends, Bob can make them dreams come true.
Certainly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ
since I've been listening to it.
I am thoroughly ashamed of KFJZ right now.
You know, I'm getting strong trance indications from this man
that he was the...
The...
The high liar of Baghdad at one time.
Adam, I'm not interested in you, I'm just...
In your past life.
I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick program
that you're putting on here.
Well, that's...
Well...
KFJZ as of now, this is terrible.
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?
People.
I mean, yeah, people, you know.
But not this is the damnedest thing I've ever heard of.
Welcome home, Arjo.
Welcome home, son.
I'm home.
But where are the aluminum people?
They're here, too.
Here?
Don't be afraid, son.
They're a part of you now, and you're a part of them.
But I'm all mixed up.
It's part of the photonic-nervonic plan.
Wow.
Are you my real father?
Am I your real father?
Father?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
How would I describe the world of the future?
Oh, it's safe.
Complex, very complex, and...
Well, it's imaginary. It's clean.
Oh, and above all, it's funny.
Well, sure, it has its drawbacks, but nobody's perfect.
And so we bid fond farewell to the future,
that romantic and cosmopolitan end of the rainbow.
Like the wonderful pages of a storybook
filled with the glorious living pictures of tomorrow.
It's all we have to look forward to.
And it probably has a place for you.
Not so fast, Mr. Cameron.
Don't leave yet.
Look, we know we aren't fooling you.
You people probably think this world looks real bad or something.
Well, we're not fooling you.
Well, you're probably laughing at us,
because it's so obvious and exaggerated.
Well, of course it is.
See, that's what so Arkansane about it.
We're laughing back at you.
See, we're here in the future,
and you, you're there in the past.
And he who laughs last,
laughs next.
See you soon.
Now, children, it's time for recess.
Please roll up your sleeves.
Hold it a minute, folks.
Listen to Charlie Musk.
I've been listening to that stuff.
That's no good.
That's bozo talk.
If you want to know what the future's really like,
put some money in Mr. D. Smith's pocket.
Because he's got what it takes.
And we're going to bring you the future just like it is.
Because in the next show, I'm the hero.
The future show is going to bring you Charlie Musk.
And I know what it's all about.
Because, brother, I've been around.
My friend, it is not God and country.
It's God!
Yeah!
Yeah!






Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!





























Yeah!
