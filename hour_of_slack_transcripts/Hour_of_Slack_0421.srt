1
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,580
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:01:08,540
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.

3
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:37,780
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.

4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:02:07,820
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,920
Before all our blood was tainted with all this human virus,

6
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,160
making us the mutants that we are today,

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,920
can you just remember how it was back when the first Bob,

8
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,500
when the first subgenius was, way back,

9
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,480
and how much simpler life was then?

10
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,320
But those times just might be coming back.

11
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,440
I said, they just might.

12
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,200
There is hope.

13
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,880
Of course, we're going to have to kill all the normals.

14
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,800
But then...

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,180
Yeah!

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,960
Yeah!

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,760
Yeah!

18
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:37,980
Yeah!

19
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,260
Yeah!

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,420
Yeah!

21
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah!

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,540
Yeah!

23
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,540


24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,560
Yeah!

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,560


26
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,660
Yeah!

27
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,820
I don't have a problem with that.

28
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,620
Does anyone else?

29
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,060
No!

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,800
Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,900
This can't be happening, man.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,640
This ain't happening.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,980
How long till it blows?

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,500
Four hours.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,380
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,980
equal to about 40 megatons.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,500
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,380
Maybe they just heard that we were having a subgenius survival tonight

39
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,440
and thought it'd be a great party.

40
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,200
Who knows?

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
But since they are...

42
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,940
They are here, or on their way, and can whiff-free the psychic stench,

43
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,800
it's time to get started and show them that we're not human,

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,620
that we are subgeniuses, and that we can fornicate with the best of them,

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,680
or die trying.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah!

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:21,680
Yeah!

48
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,700
Now let's...

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,480
Now let's get started on some kinky sex yeti lust rituals.

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,440
Are you ready to take off all your clothes and try Connie's

51
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,080
Dobbs-approved, whipped cream-covered, flip-and-slide?

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,060
Yeah!

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,180
Are you ready?

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,700
Where's it at?

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Yes!

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,480
Where's it at?

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,520
Woo!

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Couldn't get any.

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Why not?

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,460
Connie has it all!

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,120
Connie always gets the whip-and-slide.

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,500
It was supposed to be our turn.

63
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:52,780
Yeah.

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,580
Does anybody have any, like, party games we can play?

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,580
We do have a replacement sexual device, okay?

66
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,280
Oh!

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,340
Praise the replacement device!

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,280
Oh!

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,660
Praise River and Stang!

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
Yeah, the Stang-o-device!

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,560
Oh, the Stang-o-device!

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,560


73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,560


74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,560


75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,560


76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,560


77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Oh!

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,140
Praise sexual device!

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,780
The new sexual device, dear friends!

80
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,220
The crudely rendered, hideously ugly, but officially B-pipe...

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,140
The genius!

82
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,680
Our old swatch!

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,360
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,780
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang.

85
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,000
We don't do it because we said to.

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,540
It's a game.

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


88
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


91
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


92
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


96
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


97
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,540


98
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,880
If you want to do that, then go and join the Roman Catholics, or Scientologists or

99
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,100
something.

100
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,120
We ain't gonna...

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,940
If you do what we tell you, we're gonna...

102
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,400
If you let us even live, we'll have to kill you!

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900
I don't think you understand the seriousness of what's going on here.

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,860
This thing could be a thousand...

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm warning you right now, before the crowd gets here, this religion could make Christianity

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,440
look like Christianity!

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,660
It's supposed to look.

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,980
You know, it could make the Mormons...

109
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,300
The Mormons have only been around for a hundred years.

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,620
They already run a state.

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,520
The FBI and most of the...

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,520


113
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,720
No, they can't.

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


116
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
They have to go to the Indian Reservation, at least.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,200
They mean to cancel the world you civilized people made.

118
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,200
We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons threatened more

119
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,800
than they offered.

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,400
It is mind-boggling.

121
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
The possibilities are infinite.

122
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,520
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,520
The man who owns the secret of this device could control the whole world.

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,520


125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,520


126
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,620
The world, Simp?

127
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,120
The universe?

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh, my.

129
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,080
That's right. Just plug him!

130
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,080
Simp's solo's right down in that hangar.

131
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,820
And he'll love it in there.

132
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
Okay, slam the door and quit!

133
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,700
Turn on the gas.

134
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,260
Get on the beach with your shoes.

135
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,600
Bob.

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,680
Bob.

137
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,940
Bob.

138
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,280
Bob.

139
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,200
Bob.

140
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,160
Bob.

141
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,000
Bob.

142
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,480
Bob.

143
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,440
Bob.

144
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,280
Bob.

145
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,280
The new sexual device, dear friends,

146
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
the crudely rendered, hideously ugly,

147
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,020
but officially beep-piped head

148
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,780
of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

149
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,300
PiÃ±ata style.

150
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,460
Now, we're gonna have to

151
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,200
The sexual act we're talking about

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,160
in this particular case is, uh,

153
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,740
is banging the cat out of his face

154
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,800
because we love him so much

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
and the only way

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,160
The only way to know it's really Bob is to kill him!

157
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,040
Whack off on Bob!

158
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,820
And if he comes back, then it was the real Bob.

159
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,860
And if he doesn't, then it serves him right.

160
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,080
So we know whoever laughed was a guest at Stang's party,

161
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
and that's about all we know.

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Now, the question that arises as this foul and crude representation

163
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,460
of our high epoch, our own...

164
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,480
I mean, this is our savior,

165
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,460
or at least our short-duration personal savior, number one.

166
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,820
Okay, I think that's a good height.

167
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,100
That's about where he'd be if he was standing there alive.

168
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,000
That's where his head would be.

169
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,780
Okay, now, the question is,

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,380
who will be lucky enough to strike the first blow?

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,140
I'm going to open the bidding right now.

172
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,260
This young lady has the right idea.

173
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,960
She said we should pay her because that's true slack.

174
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,460
However, that would be true slack for Reverend Anita Spanking,

175
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,340
but we need true slack for the church.

176
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
So far, $8?

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,260
Let me show you.

178
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,040
I need the $8 in my hand, and where's the sacred nine iron?

179
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,220
The nine iron?

180
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:42,940
Yeah.

181
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,460
Wasn't there a sacred nine iron that was going to be used

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,180
to break the god's head into pieces?

183
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,180
I mean, I can't believe.

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,180
Here I am just trying to raise money to hurt,

185
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,420
to dreadfully injure J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

186
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,260
My God, if you can imagine how much this man hates you.

187
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
He's getting the nine iron.

188
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,980
I was just telling that he depended on your knowledge.

189
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,000
That's true.

190
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,620
I mean, yes.

191
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm going to hit that head.

192
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,240
Wait a minute.

193
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,360
I just figured it out.

194
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,100
I'm going to hit that head.

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,440
No, pardon my language.

196
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,660
I've spent more money on this damn church

197
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,240
than everybody in this room put together.

198
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,140
That may have been the way it happened, Mr. Stang,

199
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,780
but I suppose it wasn't.

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,040
All right.

201
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,220
Who's going to get a good close-up here?

202
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,560
I love you both.

203
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,360
I love you both.

204
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,140
We're going to have fun.

205
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Partake of the gifts inside Bob's brain.

206
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,440
All right.

207
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,380
Now, these are truly gifts in keeping.

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
Inside Bob's brain.

209
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,100
Plastic pipes.

210
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,560
These are the kind of pipes.

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,840
You don't even need anything in these pipes.

212
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,520
Light them up and smoke them and inhale the little furry black things that fly on.

213
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,880
Here is a penis, a toy penis.

214
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,240
They're candy nerds.

215
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,140
Gee, I wonder what that's supposed to mean.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,460
And lighters, especially premier design by Dr. Toast Wilder, I'm sure.

217
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Money.

218
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,780
Oh, I'll keep these.

219
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,220
The contents of Bob's head.

220
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Candy bars.

221
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,820
Love gel.

222
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
Ever hard candy.

223
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,740
Man.

224
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,920
All right.

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,700
We're going to empty out the cranium of our savior and high E-pop.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,520
Further.

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
And glitter.

228
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,940
Tiny.

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,040
More pipes.

230
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,120
There's the bloody remnants of J.R. Bob Dobbs' head laying on the floor of the church.

231
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,620
Unbelievable.

232
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,640
Some of the sights and sounds I've seen at these subgenius revivals.

233
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,520
Notice there was no blood, no brain.

234
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,020
You know, as you know, following the autopsy after Bob's first killing,

235
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,460
first assassination,

236
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,360
Bob's brain was found to be filled with a clear fluid, no tissue at all,

237
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:18,000
and a spongy network of fibers running, which appeared to be running down to the pipe itself.

238
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,260
Perhaps, Mr. Stang, but suppose he obscured his operation by mixing such reproductions with a legitimate inventory.

239
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,460
But you did call it.

240
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,280
Simply to explain.

241
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,060
Today, Stang, the jury has already heard the testimony about the phone call.

242
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,260
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

243
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,080
A witness who can prove you are lying, Mr. Stang.

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,500
Now there's our third witness.

245
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:52,260
Um, I, uh, am very, I'm sorry and, and, uh, deeply apologetic to have to present to you, uh, the disgusting Dr. Katahdin, or Katayden, Legume,

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:05,240
who, uh, forced his attentions upon, uh, the Sweet Church, this wonderful, lovely religion, but, uh, he paid us so much that I will get out of the way and let this, this minister of God's name, uh,

247
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,240


248
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,300
Bob, speak. Thank you.

249
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,240
Yeah!

250
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,740
Yeah!

251
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,480
You'll have to excuse me for a minute. There's something I have to take care of.

252
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Police frog!

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,220
The psychic frog!

255
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,960
Thanks for packing that for me, pal.

256
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,740
Yeah!

257
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,900
Well, brothers and sisters, I'd like to start off.

258
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,240
Uh-huh.

259
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,180
With something that has been probably affecting all of you at some point or another.

260
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,620
Something that just, just nags at you. Something that, something that, that crawls up your back and makes all the hairs stand up.

261
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,560
And what it is?

262
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,800
Know you're a real enemy!

263
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,220
Yeah!

264
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Yeah!

265
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,160
Yeah!

266
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,540
Yeah!

267
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,500
Yeah!

268
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah!

269
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,260


270
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,620
Yeah!

271
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, my.

272
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,920
That's it.

273
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:11,920


274
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:11,920


275
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,700
Brothers and sisters.

276
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:12,900
That's it.

277
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,200
You need me tomorrow!

278
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,560
Brothers and sisters, I stand here before you tonight, the conduit of Bob's word, the bearer of Bob's word, but it was not always so.

279
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,040
Right, Bob.

280
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
It was not always so.

281
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,300
No?

282
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,420
No, it is not always so.

283
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,000
There was a time when I toiled.

284
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,100
I toiled my clothes gray up there on that garbage heap.

285
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,680
Yeah?

286
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,580
And I had no pulpit. I had a shovel.

287
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,820
Then one day I was out there on the garbage heap digging.

288
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,120
I looked down at my feet and I seen this little glint of light off something that was in my feet.

289
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,180
And I bent down and picked it up.

290
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
And it was a gold coin.

291
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,420
It was a gold coin.

292
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,760
And I picked it up.

293
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,380
And I could feel its beveled edges in my hand.

294
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
There was a face on the coin.

295
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,300
I knew instinctively it was of great value.

296
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,200
It was of great value.

297
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,620
And there was a face on the coin.

298
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,560
It kind of filled me with a feeling of comfort.

299
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,620
I didn't know who it was.

300
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,780
But it just filled me with great comfort.

301
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,540
Well, I saw it there.

302
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,520
And I took my shovel and I kept digging.

303
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,340
And I found another one.

304
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,940
And then another.

305
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,740
And then another.

306
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,480
And I looked at them.

307
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,440
And I looked at my hand and I said,

308
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,620
Well, I got four gold coins.

309
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,140
So tonight I'm going to party like it's 1999.

310
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,140
Brother, I'm right there.

311
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,240
Yeah.

312
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,740
Yeah!

313
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,200
And I looked at my shovel.

314
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,500
And I cast aside my shovel.

315
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,800
I cast aside my shovel.

316
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,700
And I went down into town.

317
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,420
And I stopped by the local coin shop.

318
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,420
And I walked in.

319
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,960
Rang a little bell.

320
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,480
Up on the counter.

321
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,140
And a man come out of the back.

322
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,880
And he bellied up to the bulletproof glass.

323
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,740
And with a smile on my face, I handed him them four gold coins.

324
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,740
And he looked back at me and he said,

325
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,840
These are fool's gold, my friend.

326
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
And I thought to myself,

327
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,960
Fool's gold?

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,240
I quit my job for fool's gold?

329
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,820
What can I buy with fool's gold?

330
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,860
And the man behind the counter smiled at me.

331
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,460
And he took out a pipe.

332
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,320
And he put it in his teeth.

333
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,020
Then he sat there.

334
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,460
He took a couple of puffs off of it.

335
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,440
And pungent smoke kind of swirled around him.

336
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,260
And I realized, hey, I didn't see him late this pipe.

337
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
Well, I said, well, what do you mean?

338
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,200
I can get everything for these four fool's gold coins.

339
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,340
And he said, well, you were a fool to quit your job for fool's gold.

340
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,440
But I'm willing to sell you four visions of the future.

341
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,120
Four visions of the future, my friends.

342
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,820
And I said, well, it ain't worth anything else.

343
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,860
Why the hell not?

344
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,460
So I gave him my four gold coins.

345
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,180
And suddenly the whole shop began shaking like it had been ripped free of the ground.

346
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,920
And I ran over to the window and looked out and found that it had indeed been ripped out of the ground.

347
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,140
And it was traveling at an amazing speed through the sky.

348
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,440
And then we landed.

349
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,100
It just crashed to the ground.

350
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,760
And the coin dealer came out of the back.

351
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,180
And he put his arm around my shoulders.

352
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,540
And he said, come with me, boy.

353
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,840
And I walked out the door.

354
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,420
And I could see nothing but a grassy plain.

355
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,420
Nothing for a million miles but a grassy plain.

356
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,960
And one building, a movie theater.

357
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,500
And I walked up to the front window of the movie theater.

358
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,580
And the ticket taker was there.

359
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,360
And the coin dealer handed the four gold coins to the ticket taker.

360
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,580
He handed him back a ticket.

361
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,300
And I said, well, aren't you coming in with me?

362
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,840
He said, no.

363
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,840
Sorry, my friend.

364
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,060
I've already seen this movie.

365
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,380
And I've got to be on my way.

366
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,160
And he turned around and he walked back into the store.

367
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,480
And the store lifted off of the ground and soared away very quickly.

368
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,480
And as it was soaring away, the last thing I could see was the neon sign as it blinked out of my line of sight.

369
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Bob's Coin Shop.

370
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,980
Yeah.

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Well, I went into that theater.

372
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,620
And I sat down in the lone chair that the theater offered.

373
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,980
And the screen lit up as the lights went down.

374
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,380
And on the screen was projected an image.

375
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
It was an image of four doors.

376
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,980
And the first door opened.

377
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,680
And a beast emerged.

378
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
A beast with seven heads.

379
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,740
And on those seven heads were the seven faces of Tipper Gore.

380
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,020
Yeah.

381
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,720
And in her claws, and in her claws were rock and roll albums.

382
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,440
And she was ripping them to shreds.

383
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,720
And she had on her back a hundred leeches.

384
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,780
And each of these leeches had the face of a TV evangelist.

385
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,060
Ernest Angley.

386
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,340
Jimmy Swagger.

387
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,480
Jerry Falwell.

388
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,480
And they all screamed at me.

389
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,300
And they screamed, unclean, unclean.

390
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,400
And then the second door opened.

391
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,000
And out rode a dark horse.

392
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,720
And on the back of that dark horse was a cowboy.

393
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,100
And in that cowboy's hand was an atomic bomb.

394
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,540
And on the side of that atomic bomb was written a single word.

395
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,120
Peace.

396
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:09,440
And then I realized that Jehovah One, the cosmic space alien responsible for the creation of this world, had to have a pretty thick sense of humor that could create a race that's smart enough to build nuclear weapons but not smart enough not to.

397
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,420
And the third door opened.

398
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,660
And out strode a giant, its left hand filled with gold, its right hand filled with dead brains.

399
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,940
It left a trail of slime wherever it went.

400
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,400
And the stench was horrible.

401
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,760
He had a huge square head.

402
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,080
And a blue glow came from his face.

403
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,440
And on that face was the number of the beast.

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,980
90210.

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
And then I saw the wisdom of nuclear weapons.

406
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,980
And the fourth door opened.

407
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
And from that door came a golden light.

408
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,620
And that golden light surrounded me.

409
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,320
And it lifted me from my seat.

410
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,040
And it drew me through the fourth door.

411
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,140
And that's when I realized that that fourth door was not a door from someplace.

412
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,160
It was an entryway to the pleasure craft of the sex goddesses.

413
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Its crew was not comprised of slimy, tentacled aliens.

414
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,820
But it was filled with hot-naked sex kittens.

415
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,660
All of them fighting for the right to my...

416
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,700
I tried to resist them for oh, maybe two or three seconds.

417
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,760
But hey, I'm only a man.

418
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,200
What could I do?

419
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,340
Well, finally, exhausted, they took me to see their captain.

420
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,240
He was a large man with a large golden helmet with huge golden wings on the side of the head.

421
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,700
And brothers, it was the most impressive man I'd ever seen.

422
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,600
And sisters, although I've never had the slightest tendency toward homosexuality,

423
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,580
I must admit I felt a certain electric tingle in my groin in his presence.

424
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,120
And he turned to me.

425
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
And he took off that golden helmet.

426
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,980
And I said,

427
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,340
It's Bob!

428
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,000
It's Bob the Coin Dealer!

429
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,920
And he said,

430
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,340
Yes, I am Bob the Coin Dealer.

431
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,020
But I am also Bob the Traveling Salesman.

432
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,460
Bob the Prophet.

433
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,000
Bob the Final Hope for Mutant Kind.

434
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,100
And he said,

435
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,140
This is your reward, my brother.

436
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,000
This is your reward.

437
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,560
This silver disk filled with hot naked space babes is yours.

438
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:37,360
And the reason that it was mine was because I refused to accept my normalcy.

439
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,820
My normalcy.

440
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,820
And I rejoiced in my abnormality.

441
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,680
And I realized that, yes, this is my normality.

442
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:45,680


443
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:45,680


444
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,800
This is what awaits those who rejoice in their abnormality.

445
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,420
Is everybody here rejoicing in their abnormality today?

446
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,920
Oh, yeah.

447
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,520
That's right, brothers.

448
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,860
That's right, sisters.

449
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Exploit your abnormality for potential.

450
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
Repent.

451
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,260
Quit your job and slack off.

452
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,920
Join my mighty church.

453
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,020
This subgenius membership card that a lot of you brothers and sisters have in your possession tonight

454
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,660
is your ticket to an eternity of rampant sin.

455
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,840
Sex, slack, and salvation.

456
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,240
Oh, yeah.

457
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,220
So I gave Bob my $20.

458
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,620
And I got me a ticket on X Day, the day of the great judgment and a license to sin.

459
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh, yeah.

460
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,260
And Bob said to me,

461
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,440
You are who you are.

462
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,740
And don't be ashamed of it.

463
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't let those born-again uptight stop you from rocking and rolling in the land of milk and honey

464
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,300
and kick ass good times.

465
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,420
You are who you are.

466
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, yeah.

467
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,720
Praise Bob.

468
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,200
Can I get a praise Bob?

469
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,060
Can I get a praise Bob?

470
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,300
Praise Bob.

471
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,480
Praise Bob.

472
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,620
Praise Bob.

473
00:21:59,620 --> 00:21:59,700
Oh!

474
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,120
Yeah, I am who I am in the words of Saint Papa.

475
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,440
I am who I am in the words of Yahweh.

476
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
I am who I am.

477
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,520
Yes, sir.

478
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,380
Every time I say that,

479
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,360
I get filled up with boldness.

480
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,700
I am Dr. Le Guillaume.

481
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,380
I am a ass-whipping, spirit-filled, king-talking, prophesying, laying on a hand's healing preacher.

482
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I am who I am.

483
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,860
Praise Bob.

484
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,420
Come on, brother, say it.

485
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,620
I am who I am.

486
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,740
I am who I am.

487
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,560
I am who I am.

488
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,940
I am who I am.

489
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,140
I am who I am.

490
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,860
I am who I am.

491
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,420
Praise Bob.

492
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,040
I am who I am.

493
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,200
Praise Bob.

494
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,820
I am who I am.

495
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,220
I am who I am.

496
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,700
And now, once again, it's time to read from the unpublished volume, The Great Opus.

497
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,780
Revelation, the Babacar-pacraphon.

498
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,300
I wanted to show this off to the radio listeners.

499
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,800
Wow, look.

500
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,280
Shiny.

501
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,540
And Reverend Cole, this, yes, this is the new Bible.

502
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,240
Well, it looks good.

503
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,480
It's a new Bible, and see how the spruits and the blood drips out of it when you squeeze it.

504
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,440
That's amazing.

505
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,360
May I touch it?

506
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,360
Oh, can I touch it too?

507
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,400
I want to touch it too.

508
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,340
Bless me with it.

509
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,960
Bless me with it.

510
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,620
You may touch it.

511
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,440
Oh, I can't.

512
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,580
It oozed on me.

513
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,540
I won't wash his hands all week.

514
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,720
Five hundred pages of hell itself.

515
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:03,060
Hell and damnation that no one will ever be able to see until next year sometime when they get around and finally stop screwing around and publishing.

516
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, actually, I took two years just to put it.

517
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,060
But.

518
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,060
You know, there's so many that Bob must speak through.

519
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,060
You know, we had to channel this book through.

520
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
Yeah, but if you just let some of that ooze out.

521
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,340
We ask each the there's even a little section on the slack chapters like this down here on Chapter 12.

522
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,380
It says verse make the spot.

523
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,560
Wait two hours.

524
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Then read.

525
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,840
Here, I'll do it.

526
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,140
I'll do it.

527
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,220
Okay.

528
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,160
Well, the damage.

529
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,940
You know, I have to wait.

530
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,280
Hours.

531
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,620
Yeah.

532
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,820
Oh, why did I do that?

533
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,520
Yes, it's it's something.

534
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,280
It is something.

535
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,240
The New Testament.

536
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,740
It is.

537
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,620
It is the New Testament.

538
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,400
The Book of the Subgenius available at better bookstores everywhere.

539
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,620
So is there any on Connie?

540
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,200
There's an entire chapter on Connie Dobbs.

541
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,860
She has her own disgusting chapter.

542
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,500
And of course, within that evil chapter are will be pictures of time.

543
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:54,740
Men.

544
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,180
I found.

545
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Oh, I.

546
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,780
Yes.

547
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,100
I'm sure.

548
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,860
Where is.

549
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,480
I think that for two hours.

550
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,040
I'm sorry.

551
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,400
Speaking of pictures, look at this nifty catalog from this great place called Dream Dresser Boat.

552
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,700
See.

553
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,000
The.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,000


555
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,500
The.

556
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,960
The.

557
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


558
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


559
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


560
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


561
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


562
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


563
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


564
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


565
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


566
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


567
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,600
Mike, like.

568
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,460
Yeah, I knew Michael.

569
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,780
I'll have to review that.

570
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,000
Check that out.

571
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,160
This is an interesting catalog.

572
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,200
Folks were looking at a catalog of what looks like bondage.

573
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
And well, let's see.

574
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,340
Why.

575
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:20,600


576
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,080
It's a.

577
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,380
Oh, it's fashion, fetish fantasy.

578
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,180
We quickly.

579
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,980
That's not politically correct.

580
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,240
No.

581
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,320
That makes that.

582
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,280
That's very Catholic.

583
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,180
That woman's probably a demure, intelligent girl next door.

584
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,740
And they've made her look like some.

585
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,280
Some.

586
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,660
submissive

587
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,560
They don't look very submissive to me.

588
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,360
A craven strumpet.

589
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,360
Holy mother of Pearl Bailey!

590
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,320
How do they attach

591
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,340
those chains to those little red spots

592
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,180
on those hemispheres?

593
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,840
Those are not the actual nipple chains.

594
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,820
The actual nipple chains are suspended

595
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,240
from a zirconium piece of wiring.

596
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,100
This place is in Washington, D.C.

597
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,940
You can go shop here.

598
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,320
It not only hangs, but it actually suspends.

599
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,980
It reminds me of my favorite candy, S&M's.

600
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
Wait, I'll show you the one Michelle has.

601
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,160
They would be kind of hot in the summertime.

602
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,460
And there's a cow.

603
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,660
They might be hot in the wintertime.

604
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,620
I like the chain mail.

605
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,880
Have you guys noticed that this catalog reminds me

606
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,300
some of these humans have these

607
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,860
hemispheric globes

608
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,200
attached to them.

609
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,200
They call them women, pal.

610
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,920
The ones that have globes attached to them

611
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,580
they call them girls.

612
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,760
Oh, right.

613
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,440
Yeah.

614
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,900
They have two in the front

615
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,680
and two in the back.

616
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,140
That's interesting.

617
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,040
I wonder why it's set up that way.

618
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,000
I bet that's so that the human can know what to do.

619
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,520
The human males, no matter what direction they come from

620
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,860
I wonder why they weren't given just an owner's manual.

621
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,680
When they bump into them, they always know what to do.

622
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,540
A boner's manual?

623
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,160
That is an owner's manual.

624
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

625
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,100
That reminds me of my favorite Onan canopies.

626
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,460
Do I have a pen?

627
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,300
Yeah, it's somewhere here.

628
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,240
Yeah, there's one.

629
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,380
Onan.

630
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
Yeah, Dream Dresser.

631
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,260
Who took things in hand?

632
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,260


633
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,400
We basically had sex in the dressing room.

634
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:09,560
Delivered it to the shelf.

635
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,560
It was a really poor place to go shop.

636
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,940
Abortion is, you're killing a soul.

637
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,300
It's quick and easy.

638
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Yeah, you gotta go there in person.

639
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,480
When thousands, when millions of potential human lives

640
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,960
meet a cold death on a tile bathroom floor.

641
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,220
Well, in my case, it sticks to the ceiling.

642
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,340
Yeah, they charge like ten bucks.

643
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,600
Or maybe somewhere in some dank basement.

644
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,880
What is this stuff that's dripping on my head in the studio?

645
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Disgusting!

646
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,540
It's a very low count.

647
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,240
You heard, remember the old band, Ten Sheet?

648
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,640
I think it was a .2 ten shee-shee.

649
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,880
Take the order form out of it.

650
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,320
Well, I've got 12 kids.

651
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
I must have hit the mark 12 times anyway.

652
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,120
Let's not talk about sperm counts.

653
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,000
Now, let's move this up.

654
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,120
You have to eat the cookie.

655
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,880
I heard about that game.

656
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,460
My brother said, when I was a little kid, 12 years old,

657
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,220
my brother said that people played that game.

658
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,600
Eat the cookie.

659
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,900
What do you mean people played that game?

660
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,600
That's what you have to do to get into the trilateral.

661
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,240
You have to play eat the cookie to get into the trilateral.

662
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,460
Hey, hey, hey, we can't let that out.

663
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,680
We can't let that out.

664
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,540
Oh, we say it here to ensure disbelief.

665
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:11,880
That's true.

666
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,320
Let me keep up my front.

667
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,260
You can't say that.

668
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,200
How's that?

669
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,080
That's good.

670
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,500
Concerted misinformation.

671
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,940
Stop it.

672
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,080
You know, it's gotten to the point now where you have to,

673
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,780
I mean, there's so much disinformation around that the truth itself becomes disinformation.

674
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,960
That's true, and the truth itself is disinformation.

675
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
I don't see any double entendre there.

676
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920
I think that truth is disinformation.

677
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,140
I bet if you do it good enough, the conspiracy will pay you good money.

678
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,080
Yes, if you're infiel, you'll get paid buckets, but I don't see the point of it.

679
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,300
After all, where does it get you in the long run?

680
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,500
The same shallow grave and the same, you know, police homes.

681
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,200
Oh, you know, we make silly jokes about the crashed UFO saucers underneath the air bases

682
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,240
and the Kennedy assassination and things like that.

683
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,980
That makes up for it.

684
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,340
I love them jokes.

685
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,160
Yeah, they cry us for that.

686
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,700
You know, we trivialize these serious issues.

687
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,040
It's a living.

688
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,760
What can I say?

689
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,060
Doug, I hate to broach the subject, but we don't get paid for it.

690
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,640
You see, we haven't been contacted yet.

691
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,760
We've been threatened two times, but we haven't really been contacted,

692
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,820
and we don't get any checks in the mail yet.

693
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,980
And what you've been listening to, dear friends, on this side of show,

694
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,040
the general media barrage, little clips and things all came from puzzling evidence

695
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,100
of the KPFA-Merkley show.

696
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,700
Wonderful.

697
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:39,540
Little bits and pieces interspersed with live recordings from preaching from the Akron

698
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,580
D. Bible last couple of weeks ago in Kavanaugh's.

699
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,200
You heard Reverend Janina Grinder and a long rant by the disgusting Dr. Lake Hume.

700
00:30:51,340 --> 00:31:00,580
And then, of course, some clips from a recent brain rot theater radio broadcast from WCSB

701
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,160
in Cleveland.

702
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:10,000
In this case, with Reverend Mike Cole, a lonesome cowboy day, the good psychopath finder,

703
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,280
the bad scampi days, with, oh, who else?

704
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,380
What other guests, perhaps?

705
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,920
Princess Viardo and Jimi Hendrix here until we get the tapes open.

706
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,580
Thank you.

707
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Thank you, indeed.

708
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,620
Thank you.

709
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,620
Thank you.

710
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,160
Thank you.

711
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,340
Thanks.

712
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,580
Thanks.

713
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,400
Thanks.

714
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,920
Hey, Captain!

715
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,560
Hey!

716
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,380
Hey there, you better wake up!

717
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
There's a train coming!

718
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,140
Wake up!

719
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,240
Hey!

720
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,100
Hey, wake up!

721
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,800
Come on!

722
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,320
Come on, now, wake up, will you?

723
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,640
What goes on inside the head of a crazy man?

724
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,500
Are there explosions?

725
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,240
Color flashes?

726
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,860
Or is it just a slow, paralyzing blackness?

727
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,300
It creeps over your mind like an eclipse of the sun.

728
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,300
What goes on inside the head of a crazy man?

729
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,380
It creeps...

730
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,520
It creeps over your mind like an eclipse of the sun.

731
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,040
I think when you get into this deep psychological thinking,

732
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,420
it's an activity that can cause a lot of trouble.

733
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,540
It's like walking on a platform.

734
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,380
You make one last step and you've had it.

735
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,180
But if you succeed,

736
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,660
so you've defied the very law of gravity,

737
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,700
I'm going to succeed.

738
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,420
I'm going to beat it,

739
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,360
because I'm going to plead guilty and imply insanity.

740
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,900
Oh, yeah!

741
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,980
Brothers,

742
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,200
Bob is reported to be the power to cast out false prophets.

743
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,280
The power to cast out demons.

744
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,700
The power to lay my hands on you and heal you.

745
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,220
Amen.

746
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,860
Is there anybody here that needs to be healed?

747
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
Come up to me, brother.

748
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,720
Come up to me, brother, and be healed.

749
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,080
Come up here, brother.

750
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,820
Come on up, brother.

751
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,940
Oh, yeah.

752
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,080
What is your problem, my brother?

753
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,080
From what do you need to be healed?

754
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,660
I need no job.

755
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,580
You need no job.

756
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,460
Well, I'm going to suck that demon out of you

757
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,120
that makes you go to work every day.

758
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,580
Yeah!

759
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm going to draw him out,

760
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,260
and I'm going to take him into my own body,

761
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,180
and later I will excremeditate him and flush him.

762
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,720
Go back to the nether regions from whence he came.

763
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,020
Brother, let me put my hands on you and heal you.

764
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,340
Brother, let me put my hands on you and heal you.

765
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,440
Come on up here.

766
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,740
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.

767
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,180
He's drunk in the spirit, my brothers and sisters.

768
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,160
Oh, yeah.

769
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,080
Praise Bob.

770
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,040
Come on, brother.

771
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,500
Come on back to your feet, brother.

772
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,500
Yeah, brother!

773
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,280
Can I get an amen?

774
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,340
Praise Bob!

775
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,840
Can I get an amen?

776
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,500
Amen!

777
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,920
Can I get an amen, Bob?

778
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,340
Amen!

779
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,820
Can I get an amen, Bob?

780
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,360
Amen!

781
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,040
Praise Bob.

782
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,680
Thank you, brother.

783
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,440
Oh, yeah.

784
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,640
Yeah.

785
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,700
We're not here to save the world,

786
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,260
but it just might work out that way.

787
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,400
Whoo, brothers.

788
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,120
You have seen the miracles.

789
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,780
You have seen the power.

790
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,800
Now, what's stopping anyone out here

791
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,940
from getting that $20 membership card

792
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,240
in the Church of the Subgenius?

793
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,720
Oh, yeah.

794
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,620
Well, you've seen the miracles,

795
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,220
but if you've seen the light,

796
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,000
you'll go over and talk to Reverend Stang over here

797
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,480
and get that Subgenius membership card.

798
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,940
You'll get that ticket on the pleasure craft

799
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,180
to the sex goddesses.

800
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,660
You'll get to ride that train, brothers,

801
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,880
because you either got to ride the train

802
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,860
or get tied to the tracks.

803
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,380
Whoo!

804
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah!

805
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,420
Yeah!

806
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,480
So you get that train ticket.

807
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,760
Oh, yeah, brothers.

808
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,000
You get that train ticket.

809
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,880
Oh, yeah, sisters.

810
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,180
You get that train ticket.

811
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,700
And if you do, I'll see you on the train.

812
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,760
But if not, I'll see you on the tracks.

813
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,860
So get that ticket.

814
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,060
Oh, yeah, and keep it with you.

815
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,540
And don't leave home without it.

816
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,720
Don't be caught dead without it.

817
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,420
Thank you, brothers and sisters,

818
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,940
and praise God.

819
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,300
Praise God!

820
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,360
Praise God!

821
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:47,660


822
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,800
Praise God!

823
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,580
Praise God!

824
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,100
Praise God!

825
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,960
Praise God!

826
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,440
Please!

827
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,580
do Ace, and I am gide who have missed with the

828
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:17,580


829
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,700
Now goï¿½ad it, and I'm in hemm êµì¥í

830
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,800
uns, one hundred and twenty, and there was

831
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:22,840
just a single one who had studied

832
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,500
the

833
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,380
set in case of this kind of do it attitude

834
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,520
on mom like after the premise working around

835
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,680
out

836
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,460
around, or in most cases, even thinking they're pushing us around. We don't want to give them

837
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,020
the satisfaction of assuming they might ever push us around. Just because we're outnumbered

838
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,160
10 billion to one, just because they have 100,000 nuclear weapons and we only have three,

839
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,540
we will fight them anyway. We will fight them in the streets. We will fight them on the

840
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,740
airwaves. We will fight them in our bedrooms, in our rumpus rooms, in our bathrooms. We

841
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,040
shall persevere. Because as long as slack is free, if not a membership in the church,

842
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,160
as long as slack is free, they cannot win. They cannot win. As long as slack cannot be

843
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,020
bottled and sold, as long as the fat spirit of Dr. Legume cannot be bottled nor sold,

844
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,540
the church cannot be co-opted. As long as we can keep killing Bob and he can keep bouncing

845
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,640
back, they cannot kill us. Well, they can kill us, but we've got two different paradises.

846
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:35,160
They've got two. Holy water. Holy water. It says holy water right on it. Did you get

847
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,880
this from Pastor Tilton? Straight from Pastor Robert Tilton. This is water that God blessed.

848
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,440
It is holy water.

849
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,340
God touched this water. It's like God.

850
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,780
It's like making water on you, friends. God can wreck the microphones. God can wreck the

851
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,100
video cameras. You'll all be pregnant with the new Jesus when this is over with.

852
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,240
Just stick to the straight and narrow and you're a winner.

853
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,380
Let me lose this neck.

854
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,120
Now, look, are you sure you can? Maybe you imagine.

855
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,060
Oh, yeah, a lot of tension. Your imagination.

856
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,920
I know, but it's not the case.

857
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:33,320
People can imagine things that aren't necessarily true.

858
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,820
They're not real, you know. They think I think they're real.

859
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:48,960
But I like them anyway. They're nice. I like nice things.

860
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,220
They're still looking at the globes.

861
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,420
Yeah, they're still looking at those.

862
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,660
That reminds me of my favorite candy, S&M.

863
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,800
It's got a hurt that tastes good.

864
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,160
Why can't we have mammalian glands like that?

865
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,320
I wonder if that has to do with the Yeti thing.

866
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,880
It's because you're old then now.

867
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,560
When you get a little older, you'll have glands just like that, Dave.

868
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,720
Plus, you have children. Don't all three of you have children?

869
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,180
Someday you'll have deep feelings like I do.

870
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mike does, too.

871
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,140
I'm still nursing.

872
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,160
You have three children?

873
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,080
He's got three, but not all yours, right?

874
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,340
Some of them are mine.

875
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,100
I can only ask.

876
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,540
Some of them were just lost and hanging around.

877
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,300
He brought them in, didn't you, Michael?

878
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,120
Sure.

879
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,380
But that's not a subgenius thing to do.

880
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,160
I think the Reverend would probably say that if a lonely wave appeared on his doorstep,

881
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,740
he'd probably kick it in the groin edge and send it on its way.

882
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,580
No, not at all.

883
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,620
We take them to Malaysia for the homes of cyclist children.

884
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
Malaysia. That's where I found that catalog.

885
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,200
All those kids on those milk cartons, those kids aren't missing.

886
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,940
They're being trained to be good subgeniuses.

887
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,800
They'll be working in low Earth orbit on our space station.

888
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,340
They're not real desconocedos.

889
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,380
You're putting them to work?

890
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,680
They're perfectly useful like human worker bees.

891
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,840
What do you think?

892
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
We farm them out to NASA when we're through with them.

893
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,740
You'd think you'd get praise for this.

894
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,920
There are so many humans who lead perfectly useless lives.

895
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,860
No, I can't hear you, Mike.

896
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,940
You're too far from the microphone.

897
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,180
You'd think the subgenius church would be praised for this action, but typical or not.

898
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,580
We could let some human raise them and just turn them into little factory workers.

899
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:18,980


900
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,100
But these children are finally living perfectly useful lives in the church.

901
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,660
The church be praised.

902
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,140
Will the church believe in work they're not taking?

903
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,560
Slack work, yes.

904
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,180
Sometimes they must be worked out in the fields in order to learn how much slack they once had.

905
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,700
In order then to find out what slack was.

906
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,960
And this leads to the true spirituality of it, I imagine.

907
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
Opening that triangle.

908
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,260
That's how you know there's wool.

909
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,720
Well, it doesn't matter what it does as long as the fields are planted and they do what we say.

910
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,820
They keep little tape nets hanging around their necks as they work.

911
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,620
Listening to the...

912
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,620
The tapes.

913
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,180
The tapes.

914
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,580
The tapes.

915
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,080
Well, tapes.

916
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:09,420
You know, with this music playing, Reverend, I wonder if maybe you could give our very diminutive audience a brief taste of what it's like to work in the fields of Malaysia and how you help in the home for slack, Malik Women's.

917
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,060
Perhaps you could describe...

918
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,840
Well, that's the home for wayward girls.

919
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
The Dr. Drummond runs that...

920
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,820
In Malaysia, providing them with work.

921
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,620
Yes, and his friend...

922
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,840
Do they work in the rice paddies?

923
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,360
Yeah.

924
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,320
Oh, they work everywhere.

925
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,420
They have to work.

926
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,320
But you see, it's not so much where they are or what they're doing.

927
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:36,500
Some of them are just staying inside chambers hooked up to little tubes feeding them the experience of working 20 hours a day in the rice paddies.

928
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,340
That's so much more efficient.

929
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,280
Yes, yes.

930
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,080
And they get...

931
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,100
They learn the same lessons attached to those tubes.

932
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,080
And their lessons are...

933
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,720
Their heads are filled with these lessons of simple toil.

934
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,240
Do they reach out to you as...

935
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,300
In a ministerial way, do they send you cards and letters saying that they...

936
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,240
They appreciate what you've done?

937
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,960
Oh, they'll reach out to anyone who is...

938
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,760
When we program that person into their pleasure center, you see.

939
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,520
That's the whole idea is we have a direct input to the pleasure...

940
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,860
The desire gland can be rewired and expanded.

941
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,920
We pump it up way, way, way too big so it can never be filled up and satisfied.

942
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:18,180
So they'll always be looking for something more meaning than there is in, say, just an average squirt or ooze or whatever.

943
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,940
And that keeps them...

944
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,920
That keeps their anguish level up.

945
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,860
We're able to bottle up quite a bit of...

946
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,020
Of anguish and soul that goes into the...

947
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,220
The soul will rather well these days, too, that bottle.

948
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,580
Bottled anguish is the only thing the Elder Gods will take in trade for this planet.

949
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,460
What do you think Bob's trying to sell?

950
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,480
What do you think this whole X-Day scam is about?

951
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,540
Yeah, really, what is he trying to sell, though?

952
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,780
We need to have...

953
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,520
Okay, the Elder Gods live...

954
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,740
They get high, basically, off of human anguish.

955
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,420
That's why we have wars and traffic lights and things like, you know, bad drivers and so forth.

956
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,760
To build up a certain...

957
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,800
A certain savory anguish for these space creatures.

958
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,060
A savory anguish?

959
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,020
Who... Who will...

960
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,700
A flavorful pain, as it were.

961
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:07,500
It's like, when they get here in 1998, if they find a planet full of low-level kink, human anguish, they'll just...

962
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,740
They'll... They'll, uh...

963
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,880
Call it a loss.

964
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,700
They'll sell it off.

965
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,680
They'll just scrape, scour the planet clean.

966
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,000
And, uh...

967
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,040
That'll be it.

968
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,840
That'll be the end of it.

969
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,420
What Bob's trying to do is sell them on the proposition that this...

970
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,420
The silence fazes me.

971
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,560
They will consider any excuse unacceptable.

972
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,200
It's kind of hard.

973
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,080
You have to constantly give pep...

974
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,960
People pep talks.

975
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:42,900
You know, it's like they know better, but they're being bombarded with false slack so much more than they're being bombarded with our particular brand of...

976
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,780
Well, real slack.

977
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah.

978
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,100
You know, it's detailed theological discussions and so forth.

979
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,740
There'll be a lot of yelling and screaming and, uh, cussing.

980
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,380
Cussing, probably.

981
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,600
You know, we cuss more than most preachers.

982
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:55,820
Mm.

983
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,120
Will there be a lot of bull there, too?

984
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,980
A lot of what?

985
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,240
Bull.

986
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,500
Or...

987
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,180
Well, we'll be expelling...

988
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,480
We'll...

989
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,860
We'll probably do the ritual whereby people expel their bull.

990
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,520
Oh, no.

991
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,420
The bull that is pent up in them all week or all month.

992
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,780
We try to encourage him to, uh, scream it out.

993
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,620
Uh, uh, squeeze it out.

994
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,540
We try to squeeze...

995
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,960
Squeeze?

996
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,180
Squeeze the bull out of them.

997
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,440
Ring them real good.

998
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,720
And we collect the bull in these little metal canisters and then sell that to the Bob's.

999
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,720


1000
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,480
And, uh, they, uh, drink it and smoke it and breathe it and stuff like that.

1001
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,620
That's the best words you've ever heard?

1002
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,760
The aliens have, uh, use for certain parts of what we squeeze out of our audiences.

1003
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:34,980
Yeah.

1004
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,020


1005
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,000
Wait a minute.

1006
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,100
What?

1007
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,780
There's all these people around here.

1008
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,860
How come they're on my...

1009
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,720
But I know they're people.

1010
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,820
I don't know, but they're on my side and not on yours.

1011
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,280
I don't...

1012
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,680
You ever see Terminator 2?

1013
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,200
No.

1014
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,960
You know, it's funny how the whole world's starting to look like those rough mechs and

1015
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,500
thick mechs that appeared human but weren't really.

1016
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:52,720
Oh, yeah.

1017
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,720


1018
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,100
That's true.

1019
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,420
Put on those glasses.

1020
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,580
Oh, man.

1021
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,780
I'm sorry.

1022
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,540
I have to...

1023
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,080
No fake.

1024
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,200
Sorry.

1025
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,860
You have to brush your teeth and...

1026
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,320
You guys are really insecure.

1027
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,120
Well, you know, I forgot to do it before I came over here.

1028
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,500
No.

1029
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,480
And when you're in the presence of holiness, you, uh...

1030
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,220
It's We Are Doe.

1031
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,280
Oh, that...

1032
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,260
Oh, Princess We Are Doe is here.

1033
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,840
Bow down before the princess, boy.

1034
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,300
Yes.

1035
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,100
Yes.

1036
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,060
Hi, Princess.

1037
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,180
Hi, John.

1038
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,720
Thank you.

1039
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1040
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1041
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1042
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1043
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1044
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1045
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1046
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1047
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1048
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,860
Can I get my pictures taken with you tonight?

1049
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,440
Yes.

1050
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,700
Lisa...

1051
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,060
I mean, Weesa...

1052
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:32,700
I mean, Princess We Are Doe's cheesy wedding shots will be available.

1053
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,800
And sold.

1054
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,360
Oh, is there a honeymoon afterwards?

1055
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,260
Pardon?

1056
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,540
Is there a honeymoon afterwards?

1057
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,620
Most of the show is the honeymoon.

1058
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,180
Oh, okay.

1059
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,480
In this particular revival, we're gonna perform the marriage ceremony first, so the whole

1060
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,920
rest of the party will be the honeymoon.

1061
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,900
Oh, okay.

1062
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,140
Cool.

1063
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,140
And since we're marrying everybody to everybody else and their pets, their car keys, whatever,

1064
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:52,720
we're gonna...

1065
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:52,720


1066
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,480
Oh, it ought to be...

1067
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,540
One big mass...

1068
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,160
Something.

1069
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,600
...melding of fun.

1070
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,800
Yes.

1071
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:09,020
And Princess We has brought her special magic Polaroids so she can snap wedding photos and

1072
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,800
sell them.

1073
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,320
Oh, cool.

1074
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,740
At a very reasonable rate.

1075
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,500
We can't do that all...

1076
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,740
Oh, no.

1077
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,260
No, no.

1078
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,740
But she just left me...

1079
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,600
Gave me this note to remember that there will be a Dobbs Head pinata.

1080
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,320
Oh.

1081
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,700
So that those who have become religious figures...

1082
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:22,700


1083
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:22,700


1084
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:22,700


1085
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:22,880
Yes.

1086
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,440
...and are fanatics for Bob can take a stick and can whack Bob on the head as hard as they

1087
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,640
want.

1088
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,280
They can beat the face of their savior.

1089
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,440
I've been really one of the whacking ahead of... for a long time.

1090
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,280
For a price.

1091
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,580
Yeah.

1092
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,400
Well...

1093
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:35,840
Modest.

1094
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,000
Everything comes with one hand in hand.

1095
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,880
That's right.

1096
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,360
But of course.

1097
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,500
Hey, I think someone's already started.

1098
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,560
Yeah, yeah.

1099
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,020
Well, just...

1100
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,800
It hasn't been consummated yet and they're already started.

1101
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,500
Hey, half...

1102
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,820
With the subgeniuses, all they need is the concept.

1103
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah, that's right.

1104
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,700
It's almost better to just to know that they could...

1105
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,700


1106
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,700


1107
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,700


1108
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,700


1109
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,440
Could do it than to actually do it.

1110
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,440
That sometimes that's just a let down after the...

1111
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,100
Oh.

1112
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,120
You know, the conceptualization.

1113
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,740
It's virtual fun.

1114
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,880
Cheaper for us.

1115
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,220
Oh.

1116
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,160
I want to...

1117
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,760
I want to take Howard Cern's place and make Princess Wee the Robin Quivers because her

1118
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,460
laugh is even more infectious.

1119
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,480
Oh.

1120
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,480
Oh.

1121
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,160
Oh, thank you.

1122
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,040
It's like no matter what I say, everybody will think it's funny because she's...

1123
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,400
Because her laugh is so funny.

1124
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,900
It's got to be true.

1125
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,340
Oh.

1126
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,380
Sigh.

1127
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:36,980
Oh.

1128
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,560
I'm fine.

1129
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,100
I'm fine.

1130
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,240
Oh, no.

1131
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,840
Oh, no.

1132
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,500
Give me a towel.

1133
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,160
Give me a towel.

1134
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,380
I'll help somebody.

1135
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:46,820
So, yeah.

1136
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,280
They'll be...

1137
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,580
They'll be preaching and...

1138
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,460
And of course, they're screeching, selling and...

1139
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1140
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1141
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1142
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1143
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1144
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1145
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1146
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1147
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,460


1148
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,900
And killing Bob.

1149
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,140
You know, it's like we praise him and then we hurt him and then we praise him some more

1150
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,760
and hurt him some more.

1151
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,620
It's a lot more freedom.

1152
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,380
Maybe more repetition too, I don't know, than in most religions.

1153
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,120
Bob.

1154
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:05,880
Bob.

1155
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:06,960
Bob.

1156
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,280
Bob.

1157
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:08,780
Bob.

1158
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,600
Bob.

1159
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:10,560
Bob.

1160
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:10,840
Bob.

1161
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,680
Bob.

1162
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,280
Bob.

1163
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:12,560
Bob.

1164
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:12,860
Bob.

1165
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,160
Bob.

1166
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,620
Bob.

1167
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,640
Bob.

1168
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:15,780
Bob.

1169
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,920
What the hell is going on?

1170
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,900
It's the operator for three, unit three.

1171
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,680
Emergency.

1172
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,500
Unit three.

1173
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,140
Emergency.

1174
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,300
Unit three.

1175
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,060
Emergency.

1176
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,260
I need a trace incoming.

1177
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,700
We are not willing to kill in the name of good.

1178
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,680
We have the choice of remaining and killing or leaving.

1179
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,920
No, I don't laugh, weep or get drunk and I only serve.

1180
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I can't believe the Archons are literally shooting our souls up as a form of drug

1181
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,760
extraordinary.

1182
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,300
static. They don't shoot.

1183
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,780
Of course they don't shoot it up. They don't have bodies.

1184
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,780
They just kind of huff it.

1185
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,720
Huff it? Yeah, they dump

1186
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,660
them into a bag. They dump a bunch of soul into

1187
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,720
a bag and kind of...

1188
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
Like that. Metaphysically, of course.

1189
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,600
We're talking about on a metaphysical level.

1190
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,140
Horrifying.

1191
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,300
It's one of those metaphysical glands.

1192
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,920
It's kind of like the same process when you hack up a really

1193
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,060
good spitball loogie.

1194
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,880
Do we feel it? I mean, will we

1195
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,880
feel it when we're kind of like huffed

1196
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,720
up, so to speak? Oh, it'll feel good

1197
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,380
to you, but it'll be the last thing you feel.

1198
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,160
You'll be dead. I mean, this is...

1199
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,720
Oh, I don't have to worry about that. I'm dead already.

1200
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,240
No, no. It'll be different.

1201
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,000
You'll be dead, and

1202
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,420
the soul will be somewhere else.

1203
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,520
It won't exactly be you, Dave.

1204
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,840
Don't worry. And it won't hurt

1205
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,120
for long.

1206
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,560
It'll...

1207
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,880
Even though your otherwise

1208
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,120
immortal soul will have been consumed,

1209
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,360
and this is the only way, besides a nuclear explosion,

1210
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,740
that the soul can be consumed.

1211
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,860
Despite that...

1212
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,460
Bob will think of you more

1213
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,400
fondly than he would have

1214
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,260
otherwise, and there'll be a special

1215
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,840
plaque in your name

1216
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,480
in the Book of Humans.

1217
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,160
Well, I have plaque and stuff,

1218
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,120
but I can't believe that Blue would try

1219
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,960
and fondle me after doing something like that

1220
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,380
if I'm discarnate to begin with.

1221
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,060
Don't I have to have a body?

1222
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,180
I mean, you know, metaphor... I mean, not metaphor.

1223
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,720
Yeah, well, you have one, but

1224
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,080
it's inhabited by an eternal soul,

1225
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,020
don't you see? Actually, there's two different...

1226
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,740
There's the lower soul and the higher soul.

1227
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,780
I don't know if the listeners...

1228
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,260
The vegetable kingdom soul,

1229
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,340
and the animus kingdom soul.

1230
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,760
That's right. Yes, one of them

1231
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,840
is very badly behaved, and the other one

1232
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,080
is an idiot.

1233
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,140
So there's

1234
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,600
two great souls...

1235
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,300
No, no, no, go ahead.

1236
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,900
I dreamed of being an animated vegetable,

1237
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,100
and a lot of times I dreamed of being a candy bar

1238
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,880
and stuff, but I never thought that there would be an illusion

1239
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,900
that would allow me to be all these things

1240
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,800
and still stop...

1241
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,120
Well, now, keep in mind...

1242
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,120
It's still stuck to the roof of your mouth.

1243
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,440
The souls are...

1244
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,160
are devoured.

1245
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,580
Only those souls of those who never

1246
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,640
bought their $30 membership

1247
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,580
in the Church of the Subgenius.

1248
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,460
Oh, it's $30 now?

1249
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,440
Well, it will be $30 when the new book comes out.

1250
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,700
It's still $20 for the next year.

1251
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,620
For one more year, it's still $20.

1252
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,880
Or eternal salvation or triple your money back,

1253
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,580
and we get...

1254
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,180
You get not one paradise, but two.

1255
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,440
One while you're still alive, if you can live

1256
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,520
up to X day.

1257
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,440
And one to hang on the window, on the rearview mirror.

1258
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,900
That's right.

1259
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,220
God, two paradises.

1260
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,500
One as long as you live, which is as long as you want.

1261
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,460
And then one whenever you choose to die.

1262
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,620
Then you go to Christian heaven or Christian hell.

1263
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,440
At the same time.

1264
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,040
And if you can make it through those,

1265
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,780
then you graduate to subgenius hell or Asgard.

1266
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,280
And after Asgard, you graduate to the subgenius heaven,

1267
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,600
which is called hell.

1268
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,260
And after that, the heaven of the subgenius heaven.

1269
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,780
And so if it just goes on, it gets better and better from there on.

1270
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,620
You weren't talking...

1271
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,060
I'm kidding about getting in on a ground floor while you...

1272
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
It's the ground...

1273
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,680
Yes, this is...

1274
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,160
We are in hell now.

1275
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,940
This is the actual hell that they talk about.

1276
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,180
The plane of eternal damnation and torture.

1277
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,500
If you ever wondered why life didn't seem fair,

1278
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,160
why there's pain and so forth,

1279
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,780
you're in hell now.

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,920
And yes, and when we try to tell people they're in hell,

1281
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,160
they think the demons are just satirists

1282
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,600
and it's all just a stupid comedy thing.

1283
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,360
It's in hell.

1284
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,700
It's like you have to work.

1285
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,040
It's like you have to work.

1286
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,040


1287
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,600
It's endless toil for no more reason

1288
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,640
than to earn just a few minutes of slack on the weekend or something.

1289
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,400
You age, for instance, in hell.

1290
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,300
You, you know, people aren't as attracted to you.

1291
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,260
You have to wear a lot of makeup or...

1292
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,420
Put a sock on yourself.

1293
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,520
Yes, it's, it's, uh...

1294
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,740
And that's the easy.

1295
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,480
Of course, this is the ground floor of hell.

1296
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,900
After this, you'll graduate to the one with the flames and pitchforks.

1297
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,020
That's actually quite a bit more interesting.

1298
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,820
Like I say, it gets better from here on.

1299
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,540
The sheep help you sleep.

1300
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,700
Talking about the...

1301
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,800
Here, listen to this.

1302
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,120
They didn't realize the stages of hell they had to go through.

1303
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,120
But when, uh...

1304
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,820
Listen to the words here for a second.

1305
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,540
When you must snooze, it's wonderful to use.

1306
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,400
Sleep.

1307
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,140
Sheep.

1308
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,800
Sheep to help you sleep.

1309
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,500
Now listen here.

1310
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,220
Number one help plays accordion.

1311
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,660
That worked.

1312
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,300
That worked.

1313
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,660
This is the music they play in heaven.

1314
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,460
Yeah.

1315
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:11,620
Eternal.

1316
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,600
Number three says we.

1317
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,640
Oh, I want number three.

1318
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,400
Oh, blast.

1319
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,980
I'm still conformed as ever.

1320
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,520
I try to grasp metaphysics and apologetics,

1321
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,140
and I just don't seem to get the gist of it.

1322
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,740
Number six is doing tricks, Dave.

1323
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,140
Number six.

1324
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,780
That means we have six incandescent, individual, highly evolved souls.

1325
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,160
And each one is lower than the next one.

1326
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,760
No?

1327
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,660
No.

1328
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,600
That's just our shedding our shells.

1329
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,980
Get the best deal on all of those souls.

1330
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,140
And number ten says do it again.

1331
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,600
That's being reincarnated into hell.

1332
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,160
Yeah, okay.

1333
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,800
Now number two.

1334
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,200
Number two?

1335
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,820
Being reincarnated back into hell.

1336
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,600
Okay, number three?

1337
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,700
Not carnated, but being cremated in halcyon.

1338
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,640
Okay, number four?

1339
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,260
And that's when you escape.

1340
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,540
Okay, but rhyme with the number now.

1341
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,460
Number five?

1342
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,100
That's when you're still alive.

1343
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,340
Okay, number six?

1344
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,280
Number six.

1345
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,780
Uh, we crossed the river Styx.

1346
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,080
Oh, there we are.

1347
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,140
On the other side, there's Charon, or Charon, or whatever his name is,

1348
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,320
with his giant beezerball black belly and his huge, rancid nose.

1349
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:30,140
He, uh, pronouncing epithets to the wind and guiding the little Saracens off over there.

1350
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,320
Where were we?

1351
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:31,980
Here's number five.

1352
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,380
Okay, and then we got into number six.

1353
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,520
Cross the river Styx.

1354
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, now number seven?

1355
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,240
Number seven.

1356
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,220
Seven times seven.

1357
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,240
Seven times seven.

1358
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,420
Seven, seven, seven.

1359
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,040
Number eight?

1360
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,240
Uh, oh, oh, Bob hates.

1361
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,140
No, he hates.

1362
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,500
Number eight?

1363
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,760
Bob says he hates.

1364
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,660
Number nine?

1365
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:52,960
Hate, hate, hate, hate.

1366
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,160
Number nine?

1367
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,580
He turns a man to swine like sure she did.

1368
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,740
And water into wine.

1369
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,220
And ten?

1370
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,940
And water into wine.

1371
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,300
No, that's a whole.

1372
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,200
A big fat hen.

1373
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,780
And number eleven?

1374
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,320
Bob is a slave to Mercury.

1375
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,800
Bob burned down heaven.

1376
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,880
This is getting a little bit tough.

1377
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,460
Okay, number twelve?

1378
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,380
Uh, let's not dwell.

1379
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,520
Let's stop.

1380
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:11,600
Let's stop.

1381
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,600


1382
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,600


1383
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,600


1384
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,600


1385
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,600


1386
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,140
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1387
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,540
This is a stupid religion.

1388
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,560
Cut it.

1389
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,400
But that's okay.

1390
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,460
Since when was it ever a sin in the Church of the Sub-Gene to have a stupid religion?

1391
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,400
Let's have a stupid religion.

1392
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,980
That's nine-tenths its appeal.

1393
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,340
That is, that is, it's the only real, it's, it's entertainment is what it is, and we happen

1394
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,340
to offer more gods and devils to pick from than most other religions.

1395
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,040
Speaking of entertainment.

1396
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,840
I know, I, I was, you know, fond of your Roman Catholic and Orthodox tradition because

1397
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,940
there were so many fine saints and little things.

1398
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,600
Then I was attracted to the vast majority of the Catholic Church.

1399
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:41,600


1400
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:41,600


1401
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:41,600


1402
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,980
I was attracted to the Ladois because, you know, there were so many Loas and stuff,

1403
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,800
but there's nothing like the Church of the Sub-Genius for lots and lots of deities.

1404
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,620
That's right, dear friends.

1405
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,820
We've got deities galore here in the Church of the Sub-Genius, including Lonesome Cowboy

1406
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,140
Dave.

1407
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:06,580
Heard just that on his beautiful show with, uh, the Reverend Chaz, Reverend Dan, and,

1408
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,580
uh, WCSB, and, and in this case, uh, with, uh, your, uh, friend, uh, Reverend David.

1409
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:11,580


1410
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,280
Good friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang as a guest.

1411
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,820
A guest.

1412
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:24,080
And, uh, before that, a little bit of, uh, uh, Akron Radio, uh, John, uh, Reverend John

1413
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,140
Devine's show.

1414
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,760
And before that, Brain Rot and KPFA, uh, uh, Puzzling Evidence and its end, uh, revival,

1415
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,520
blah, blah, blah.

1416
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:39,760
And, uh, yeah, I know you need to know, uh, the sacred post office box.

1417
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
And because you need to know.

1418
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:41,560


1419
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,760
You do have your pen or pencil ready.

1420
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,620
And you can get the free information from, uh, uh, uh, Bob.

1421
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,580
Yeah, just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1422
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,300
That's, once again, that's box, P.O.

1423
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:08,960
Box, 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1424
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,560
And, uh, that zip code is P.O.

1425
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:11,560


1426
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:16,160
Box, of course, 75214.

1427
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,480
Right.

1428
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,260
P.O.

1429
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:27,200
Box, 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214 for all you need to know and a lot that you won't

1430
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,400
really want to know.

1431
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,180
You'll be sorry having known it.

1432
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,440
You must know even if the knowing must get you.

1433
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,620
Praise Bob.

1434
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,420
Thank you.

1435
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,580
Thank you.

1436
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:39,160
Thank you.

1437
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,560
Thank you.

1438
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:41,560


1439
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,820
Thank you.

1440
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,740
Thank you.

1441
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,160
Thank you.

1442
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,220
Thank you.

1443
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:00,480


1444
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,000
You sure got some trouble setting up in your home.

1445
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1446
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1447
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1448
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1449
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1450
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1451
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1452
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000


1453
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,020


1454
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,020


1455
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,840
Bye-bye.

1456
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,060
Come with me.

1457
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,020
Uh.

1458
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,520
Praise Bob.

1459
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:10,520


1460
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:10,600
Praise Bob.

1461
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:10,600


1462
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,540
Say something.

1463
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:36,880
But there's nothing like the church of the sub-genius for a lot and lot of deities.

1464
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,160
Alvin and the chipmunk?

1465
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I heard Alvin and the chipmunk.

1466
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,060
I think this is a Barney record.

1467
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,000
Let's hear it for America.

1468
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,160
It's Barney in the red, white, and blue, you know.

1469
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,300
God, these are the end times.

1470
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,440
I would like to see Barney ripped asunder and his bowels sprayed all over the desert.

1471
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,020
It's Barney and laughing and now crying children because I don't like him.

1472
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,440
But you're wearing a purple shirt.

1473
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,000
It suggested that there's an unholy connection between...

1474
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,140
Barney!

1475
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,840
Barney and Rush Limbaugh.

1476
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,120
No, who's the little blonde kid?

1477
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,260
That Rush Limbaugh is in fact Barney in a Rush Limbaugh suit.

1478
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,040
Oh yeah, I've heard that before already.

1479
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,860
Now I've heard it.

1480
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,160
Identical soma types?

1481
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,140
I heard Barney...

1482
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,440
Identical soma types.

1483
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,360
Barney is a Rush Limbaugh impersonator.

1484
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Barney is Rush Limbaugh.

1485
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:25,780
Rush Limbaugh.

1486
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,520
Is Rush Limbaugh.

1487
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,360
In a Barney...

1488
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,960
In a Barney...

1489
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,540
Rush Limbaugh suit.

1490
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,420
Oh, I heard it was in a Barney suit.

1491
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:30,520
A fake brother.

1492
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,820
And you can see the zippers and stuff too.

1493
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,220
I mean, it's kind of...

1494
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,620
It seemed like they...

1495
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,040
I mean, it's top show.

1496
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,580
It's a big hit.

1497
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,120
That's a last...

1498
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,220
The last thing I'd want to see is Rush Limbaugh's zipper.

1499
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,520
I'm sorry.

1500
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,200
You have seen it, I know.

1501
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:43,860
No, no.

1502
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,400
That's...

1503
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,100
I just...

1504
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,600
That's why he wants everybody to go back in the closet, you know?

1505
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,440
So he can go hang out at the Y down by the Capitol and...

1506
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:51,920
That's right.

1507
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,960
And you can sit in a steam bath and wait for a hot trick to come by.

1508
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,500
Yeah, guys with triple rings in the head of their...

1509
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,660
And don't be alone with them.

1510
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,440
And after they kill the head choppers,

1511
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,940
then we kill them.

1512
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:36,260
And now we're going to talk about a really exciting show this time.

1513
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,520
You're called.

1514
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,100
Very well.

1515
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,620
Well, I do.

1516
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,080
The question now...

1517
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,920
How do you spend your gleaming hour?

1518
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Dreaming of the show.

1519
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,900
Oh, come on.

1520
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,980
She's reading that answer.

1521
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,600
Yeah, you can...

1522
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,140
That's too pat and perfect.

1523
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,800
Too plumped up and pretty.

1524
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,200
It's right off of that card.

1525
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,380
Well, it's the answer to what I was talking about.

1526
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,180
Forget the cue cards, my dear, and go with the flow.

1527
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,320
The National Show.

1528
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,320
The guest and music...

1529
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,440
Dreaming of the show.

1530
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,840
And then learning about the show.

1531
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,360
All participants...

1532
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,820
Reading the little show biography...

1533
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:09,860
Yes.

1534
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,820
We're learning about life from our friends on the show.

1535
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,800
Nobody on the show is awake.

1536
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,260
But we're not learning too much.

1537
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:16,360
Simultaneously.

1538
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,540
Well, if you listened carefully,

1539
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,020
you would have heard my earlier lecture about the Electoral College.

1540
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,200
And how about in the year 1800...

1541
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,440
You really see people.

1542
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,780
No, I don't go to the Electoral College.

1543
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,540
I go to the other...

1544
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:35,220
Well, that's because we're all connected by the electroencephalogram,

1545
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,780
which registers our thoughts on the dream.

1546
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,100
It feels like you're on the water when you're on the tree.

1547
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,620
One can see the undisturbed waves of sleep.

1548
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:47,180
Well, if you plug that thing in there and plug that other thing in there...

1549
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,960
The music goes round and round and it comes back here.

1550
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,320
You don't want to know what you end up with.

1551
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,480
Well, you might end up with the bottoms up below the belt review.

1552
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,600
Something resembling the show, I suppose.

1553
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:03,500
Something resembling an eel, but it might also be a stonefish,

1554
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,900
that primitive, poisonous creature.

1555
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,340
You can't be fat, thanks.

1556
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,980
That thing?

1557
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,540
Yes, natives refer to it as a one-, two-, or three-foot stonefish,

1558
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,380
which puzzled archaeologists for many years.

1559
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,960
Stung by a seal.

1560
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,780
You can't be a stonefish and you can't eat the shell.

1561
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,260
You're supposed to...
