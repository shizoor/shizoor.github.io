No, not without

31
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm lost in the desert and I'm dying of thirst

32
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm grasping at straws, chasing a mirage

33
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm sure to expire unless you get here first

34
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,620

Please give me some, whatever's something greater

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm lost in space, floating up in space

46
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,140
I'm upside down

47
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,220
It's cold and dark, dark as no bar

48
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm surely drift away unless you bring me down

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Drawed up

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,880
Lo thorough

63
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:12,960
So judgmental

64
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:12,960


65
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,280
impossible

66
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,800
Uh, um, different

Absolutely nothing

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Bye.

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Bye.

78
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:48,380
This is Mark Mothersbaugh showing off his Fairlight synthesizer, early sampler that he had just got in 1984. To me, I was helping with their music video of Are You Experienced? And, well, this kind of thing happened.

79
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,120
Fairlight, Fairlight, Fairlight.

80
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
Fairlight, Fairlight.

81
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,600
Fairlight, Fairlight.

82
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,020
Fairlight, Fairlight.

83
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,060
There. Speak to him, boogie.

84
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,960
Hi there, Long Beach.

85
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,260
You know, we used to do devil music like that band Devo.

86
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,800
But then, Jerry over here, he sat down on a Bobby Dylan record, and the Lord came into him.

87
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,220
And now we do music you love.

88
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,380
I got something here I wrote for you people.

89
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,300
I just want everybody to read this, okay?

90
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,860
Make sure you all read it.

91
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,160
Yeah, let's do it.

92
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,000
Here we go.

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,200
Hey!

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,260


98
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,000
You'll have us bury in your dick lies.

99
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,700
Oh boy.

100
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:20,700

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:20,720

Well, she looked great.

You gotta know she's on to it.

114
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,020
With a long string of pearls

115
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,540
But you gotta serve somebody

Yes, you've got to serve somebody

117
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,780

But you gotta serve somebody

120
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,180

Dancing on the stage

122
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,000
Money, drugs at your command

123

A high-colonic freak

126

You might be the president

138

Of some big TV network

139
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,920

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't go, oh.

176
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,740
Yosemite sound.

177
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,040

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,660
Dreamed I laid a toaster.

181
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,620
And he caught me in the air.

182
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,800
Still on base for Cali standards.

183
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:08,800


184
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,360
But it was all a talking ludship.

185
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,360

197
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,520
It's all I wanna do.

198
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,720
Whammo!

199
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,300
Itchy, itchy goo.

200
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,320
There's a pile next to you.

201
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,100
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

202
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
And it's turning blue.

203
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,520
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo.

204
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,740
It's all I wanna do.

205
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,800
Whammo!

206
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,400
You got me running in circles like a big, big baby.

207
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm so happy I just wanna die.

208
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,820
Cause it's baby love that comes from up above.

209
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Move on over.

210
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
I wanna get closer.

211
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,820
Move on over.

212
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,320
Wanna twaddle with you.

213
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
Move on over.

214
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,660
Satisfy my urges.

215
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,500
Please, please, hope I got the goo goo.

216
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,880
Itch, itchy, itchy goo.

217
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,880
There's a pile next to you.

218
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,720
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

219
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,440
And it's turning blue.

220
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,520
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

221
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,060
Itchy goo, itchy goo goo.

222
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,380
It's all I wanna do.

223
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,520
Whammo!

224
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,860
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

225
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,620
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

226
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:34,900
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

227
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:34,900


228
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:34,900


229
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:34,900


230
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:34,920
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

231
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,340
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

232
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,420
Itchy goo, itchy goo.

233
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,560
All right, itchy.

234
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,920
Itchy goo, itchy goo goo.

235
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Itchy goo, itchy goo!

236
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,320
It comes from up above

237
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,700
Move on over

238
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,620
I wanna get closer

239
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Move on over

240
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,220
I wanna twaddle with you

241
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,140
Move on over

242
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,520
Satisfy my urges

243
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Please, please

244
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,620
Hope I got the goo-goo

245
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,640
Itchy, itchy goo

246
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
Got me thinking of you

247
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
Itchy goo, itchy goo

248
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,200
Oh baby, I love you

249
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,320
Itchy goo, itchy goo

250
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,940
Itchy goo-goo-goo

251
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,180
It's all I wanna do

252
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,660
When I'm home

253
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,340
Amazing.

254
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,660
I'm not sure where that one's from.

255
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,280
And I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to get to Dave on.

256
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,940
He's trying to call in, but we seem to be having some sort of a strange, nasty...

257
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,000
If I go like this, hello?

258
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,820
Hello?

259
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,120
Oh, there is Dave.

260
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,660
Yay!

261
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,200
Oh, it worked.

262
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,160
Are you on the air?

263
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,920
Yeah.

264
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,300
We're...

265
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,860
We...

266
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,540
We seem to be.

267
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,140
Why you be draggled, young old Philistine?

268
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah, there's something funny about me.

269
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,460
You've been there a long while.

270
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,900
That's right, my man.

271
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Well, celebrating the passing of Bob.

272
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,960
Yeah.

273
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,740
Still, Casale, as we would normally say.

274
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,940
Another Bob.

275
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,240
Down the Bob trail, or down the old Bob tube, or out the old Bob window, or...

276
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,820
Well, we like to think that Bob Casale has joined the...

277
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,780
The men from Planet X ahead of us.

278
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,520
The end of the world has already come.

279
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,680
He's on his escape vessel for X-Day.

280
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,860
Bob's promise came true for Bob 2.

281
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:36,900
Well, it would not be in any way, I don't think, superstitious to talk about flatulence then.

282
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,760
Well...

283
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,560
Not that that, you know, is pertinent at this time.

284
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,840
Because I know it's not.

285
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,540
But...

286
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:55,040
Well, you know, it is sad when somebody croaks at the young, young age of 61.

287
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,600
Only 61 years young.

288
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,560
Actually, 61 is pretty old, if you're young.

289
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,480
And since I think young, I think that's pretty old.

290
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,220
And I'm 60, and I know it's old.

291
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,340
And you're even older.

292
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,740
Oh, I'm 25, 6, 7, 5, 30 years older now.

293
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,060
I was looking up the ages of the Devo's just before the show.

294
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,560
Because I...

295
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,840
Suddenly got a little curious.

296
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,960
Like, which is the older brother?

297
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,720
And Jerry, it seems, was born in 1948.

298
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,660
Oh.

299
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,980
And Mark was born in 50.

300
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,240
So, um...

301
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,740
And the Casale boys hail from Kent, Ohio.

302
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,600
Which brings us...

303
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Water Street Bums.

304
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,260
Which brings us to a little announcement, which is not so sad.

305
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Even though Bob Casale won't be playing bass.

306
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,660
Actually, who can replace Bob Casale?

307
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,320
I know.

308
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,220
Chaz.

309
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,740
Chaz Smith.

310
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,020
That's not funny.

311
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,660
I know.

312
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,740
It made Legume laugh.

313
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:10,420
Anyway, there's an art show at the art gallery run by the sister of Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

314
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,520
I bet it's on Water Street, too.

315
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,900
Um...

316
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,260
No, it's on Front Street.

317
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,160
Well, that's just a saying.

318
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,520
No, you're right.

319
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:27,840
It's at 2091 Front Street because it's called Studio 2091.

320
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:40,480
And it's an art gallery run by Amy Mothersbaugh Roos, the sister of Bob 1 and Mark 0.

321
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,320
That squid-loving woman.

322
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,220
Yeah, but the important thing is, on March 8th, there's a show...

323
00:25:47,220 --> 00:26:03,820
an art show opening of paintings and gigas by Apostasy Fenord, who some of us know as Reverend A.P. O'Stacey, and others know as Miss Torrey.

324
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:11,420
But she's been working on some crazy, I would say somewhat devolved paintings.

325
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,920
Oh, yes.

326
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,440
Greatly devolved.

327
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,780
Some samples of her art.

328
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,680
In fact, we've got a...

329
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,100
They're animals.

330
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,380
We're sick.

331
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,140
We're upset by her hanging over our business table.

332
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,440
I mean, our dinner table.

333
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,080
Yes, we do.

334
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,000
Where we do our business.

335
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,300
Bob is watching us.

336
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,320
Thanks to Apostasy.

337
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,600
Her business is all over the house, from what I've heard.

338
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,180
Well, yeah.

339
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,440
Yeah, but it's a pretty...

340
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,240
Because of the increasing decrepitude.

341
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,940
But that is an excuse from a lot of the other, you know, weird activities out of your attic window.

342
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:46,900
So, anyway, there's going to be a little subgenius gathering on March 8th at Mark Mothersbaugh's sister's art place to show off.

343
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,520
Reverend Apostasy Fennord's art.

344
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,880
And we'll be there.

345
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,320
And Dr. Legume and Reverend Pockets will be there.

346
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,400
And Susie the Flusie may even show up.

347
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:56,840
Might.

348
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,500
I hope so.

349
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:57,640
She might.

350
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,220
It's in the Akron area in Cuyahoga Falls.

351
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,340
Is that Bob's real name?

352
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh, that's right.

353
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,240
It's not in Kent.

354
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,640
It's in Cuyahoga Falls.

355
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
2091 Gallery.

356
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:16,120
Studio 2091 in Cuyahoga Falls, where you can fall all over yourself to look at the cool pictures.

357
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,040
Well, that sounds absolutely lovely.

358
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,860
And giggles.

359
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
Except for the fact that you said it was in Kent.

360
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,120
And now you've...

361
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,180
Now it's in Cuyahoga Falls.

362
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,680
Well, you're right.

363
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,060
Now that's what...

364
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,520
Yes.

365
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,680
Well, it's all kind of near Akron, right?

366
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,720
Mm-hmm.

367
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,160
And it's all kind of near Kent.

368
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,320
And everything's kind of interconnected.

369
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,800
But it's not all the same.

370
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Because you can go to the wrong town.

371
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,780
Right.

372
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,940
Jeez dang, I wish you'd stop doing that.

373
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,180
You sent me the wrong town last night.

374
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,000
I did?

375
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,040
Yeah.

376
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,100
I was in there in a dream.

377
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,560
I was almost asleep.

378
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,440
And I got the clans.

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,480
Got in the car and drove over there.

380
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,600
And nothing happened.

381
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,140
I'm kind of losing faith in a lot of this Bob stuff.

382
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,340
Not Bob.

383
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,020
That's good.

384
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,800
That's good.

385
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,240
That's stage two of your brainwashing.

386
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,300
First, we roll out the red carpet for you.

387
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,220
And then we pull the carpet out from under you.

388
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,400
So you fall flat on your face and hate Bob.

389
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,400
And then we kill everybody named Bob.

390
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,320
Except for J.R. Bob Dobbs, who you can't kill.

391
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,160
Because it's been done.

392
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
And that's...

393
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,140
Not enough times, if you ask me.

394
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,460
But do you have any treasured memories of the Devo's?

395
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,720
I mean, the Devo's are still around and everything.

396
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,420
But they were working on some projects.

397
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,920
The Casali brothers were.

398
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,500
And now there's only one.

399
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,480
And...

400
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,560
Actually, there's another Casali brother still in Akron that we've met.

401
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,080
We had dinner with him.

402
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,420
Remember?

403
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,240
Yes.

404
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,900
That one time.

405
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,140
After a devotional.

406
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,560
Yes.

407
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,760
He was the smart one who didn't get into the rock and roll business.

408
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,040
He seems to have more slack for that.

409
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,760
I don't know.

410
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,780
Yes.

411
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,100
It's a very difficult road to hoe.

412
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
It's tough.

413
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,920
It's rough.

414
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,740
Full of fluff.

415
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,980
Earlier, we played some material from...

416
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,480
From when Devo was briefly born again.

417
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,420
And they changed their name from Devo to Dove.

418
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,460
Which has the same number of letters.

419
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,900
They saved money on that.

420
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,200
It's an anagram.

421
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,120
It's the same business.

422
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,580
Anagram from, you know, Devoid and so forth.

423
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,100
Right.

424
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,180
And so that's why you heard Boogie Boy singing that Bob Dylan born again song,

425
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,400
You Gotta Serve Somebody.

426
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,140
But Boogie Boy is like a very weird looking person.

427
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,360
Or whatever it is.

428
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,000
He is.

429
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,560
Yeah, he is a weird looking person.

430
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,880
He's kind of rubbery looking.

431
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
He hasn't aged at all.

432
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,680
No.

433
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,140
In what's been like 40 years.

434
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,960
Right.

435
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,340
And he's still a baby.

436
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,460
He's still a great big fat baby in diapers.

437
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,500
With his finger in a toaster.

438
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,880
That's the colloidal masses in his ears.

439
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,960
All fat babies are the cutest.

440
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,400
There's too many in Boogie Boy's ears.

441
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,480
There's too many of that same kind of sound receptor stuff.

442
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,980
The same anachronistic noises.

443
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,140
Push in every night.

444
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,040
He goes right into your cerebral cortex.

445
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,520
Sometimes it does.

446
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,820
Well, we're all Devo.

447
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,480
Dr. Sinister is here.

448
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,160
He walked in.

449
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,360
Princess.

450
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,900
Princess has always been Devo.

451
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,260
We were all devoted.

452
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,780
Oh, and there's going to be another devotional this year.

453
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Yes.

454
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,500
They skipped one or two.

455
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,320
In August.

456
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:40,900
Right.

457
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,820
In August at the Beachland Ballroom.

458
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,120
Yes.

459
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,560
As they have been before.

460
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,140
I don't know if any of the band will be there.

461
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,000
Unfortunately, we're pretty sure we won't be there.

462
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,280
Because we have a prior commitment.

463
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,260
But we thought that last time.

464
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,020
Remember that one year we thought we were going to Jamaica for the drug conference?

465
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,680
Oh, that's right.

466
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,680
And it fell through.

467
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:07,920
An hour before we left for the airport, I called the guy around and it turned out the whole thing was a complete lie.

468
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,360
Well, it sounds like everything is a complete lie.

469
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,740
So we did get to go to the devotional that year.

470
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,220
Yes.

471
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,260
That was a hoax.

472
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,060
Look, there's no hip straddling in this business, Stangy, Wangy, Mangy.

473
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,400
No hip straddling?

474
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
There's no hip straddling.

475
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,480
There's no false microphone work with the tissue papers and the other accruedments.

476
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,000
Right.

477
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900
The accruedments.

478
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,420
To create this mind control flavor over vast numbers of human beings that don't deserve it.

479
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,980
Some of them certainly do, of course.

480
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,520
But I forgot what I was talking about, so I'll shut up.

481
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:43,880
No.

482
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm going to do this as well because I promised the listeners that I would play some Devo tunes that they probably haven't heard.

483
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,060
And the ones I've played, they might have heard.

484
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:00,100
But there's some stuff from a collection called DNA Recombo or Recombo DNA, something like that.

485
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:07,820
It's like songs that didn't make the album cut or early versions of songs that have changed.

486
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm going to play one of those right now, okay?

487
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,420
Woohoo!

488
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,180
Okay.

489
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,560
You can listen.

490
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,800
Listen, even if I pot you down.

491
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,620
Okay.

492
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,020
Oh my God.

493
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Please let me listen!

494
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,820
Are you listening?

495
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:49,820


496
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,140
Good that's no good.

497
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,600
Listen.

498
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:52,600


499
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:52,600


500
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:52,600


501
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:52,600


502
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,720
What's this?

503
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:53,860


504
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:53,860


505
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:53,860


506
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:53,860


507
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:03,200
Now that the world had badly gone to hell, I could hear more and more of this跳ing-standing

508
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,200


509
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,400
So we can see more so.

510
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,400


511
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,400


512
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,080
And two of myuellementpanel gelears get either produced as것 urgentLY??

513
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,400
They're coming in hiawat.

514
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,180
You say, what?

515
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,180


516
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,540
Listen, this is my incarnation of something.

517
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,540


518
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,540


519
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,260
Because if they could be, they probably would be

520
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,700
It's best not to wait until then

521
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,400
Life must be healed or at least bitten into

522
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,920
To get past the surface, a moment of truth

523
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,460
You know when it's right, it's sweet deep inside

524
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,380
It's real and it's better that some things don't change

525
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,980
For centuries, some could not be seen

526
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,280
And sat in the mind before MTV

527
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,880
It's the way of the world

528
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,120
It's the world, it's the way we live

529
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,620
Live, live

530
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,360
So things could be different or could be different

531
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,700
It seems pretty hard to believe

532
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,760
Because if they could be, they probably would be

533
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,420
It's best not to wait until then

534
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,360
Life must be healed or at least bitten into

535
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,080
To get past the surface, a moment of truth

536
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,600
You know when it's right, it's sweet deep inside

537
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,520
It's real and it's better that some things don't change

538
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,180
It's the way of the world

539
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,280
It's the world, it's the way we live

540
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,460
It's the way of the world

541
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,700
It's the world, it's the way we live

542
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,600
Live

543
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,280
Live

544
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,080
That's what this cast, this thing on this?

545
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,400
Yes, this thing is on.

546
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,520
This thing is on?

547
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Yeah, that was some kind of strange Devo song that I never heard before today.

548
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,780
It's the way of the world.

549
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,220
Well, tough.

550
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,800
I don't know which world they're talking about, though.

551
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,640
I hope it's not the same world you're talking about.

552
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,840
These corruptigated worlds full of fish and spineless creatures.

553
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,720
I don't know.

554
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,500
Let's see.

555
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,080
Here I got it right now.

556
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,640
Oh, yeah.

557
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Oh, yeah.

558
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,720
An obsidian.

559
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,540
Oh, no.

560
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,640
I guess another word.

561
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,960
And a bunch of dirty mule crap.

562
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,780
Jeez.

563
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,560
I keep losing my place here.

564
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,640
Oh, this one is directed right to you.

565
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,940
Dearest Reverend Ivan Stang,

566
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,580
I've noticed that during the past few weeks of your many broadcasts,

567
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,400
which seem to please no one but yourself,

568
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,200
which seem to please,

569
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
no one but yourself,

570
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
that you have omitted to remind your listening audience

571
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
that there are...

572
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,720
Oh, jeez.

573
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,960
Now I can't read the rest of this.

574
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,920
For no one's pleasure but your own.

575
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,920
At least you can say that your show pleases you.

576
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,060
I think it's just regular old drool that blurted out.

577
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,760
But sign Susie, not Susie.

578
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,100
Beckett, Slarton, then.

579
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,620
Beckett.

580
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
The suitcase or something.

581
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,840
David, are you feeling okay?

582
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,360
You sound kind of slowed down.

583
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,360


584
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,860
You sound like maybe you had a stroke or something.

585
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,440
No.

586
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,780
Dave can't have a stroke.

587
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,340
I've had three of them just today.

588
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:42,980
No.

589
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,620
But you had three strokes today.

590
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,940
Strokes are no laughing matter.

591
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,660
When you're marking your territory,

592
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,500
sometimes you'll have a little flash in the back of your head

593
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,840
and you'll start humping the wall.

594
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,820
Is that what you're talking about?

595
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,440
Well, no.

596
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,220
If you can stroke, you don't have to hump.

597
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,600
But let's not go any deeper into that.

598
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,720
Okay.

599
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,540
So to speak.

600
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,240
I don't want to be associated.

601
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,860
I don't want to be associated with people like that

602
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,980
or ideas like that.

603
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,800
In the background, we're playing a record or a CD

604
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,100
called Devo, Easy Listening Disc.

605
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,060
A classic.

606
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,820
Yeah.

607
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,840
Well, the easiest thing you could do with it

608
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,900
in a situation like that is create a vast slurry,

609
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,500
you know, in a huge vat of like six different chemicals.

610
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,160
And you put them all in there.

611
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,000
You put like a plug underneath them

612
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
and where it's the same place where you're lighting the fire.

613
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
And that's the way the Babylonians did those tricks

614
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,180
with the rocks and everything.

615
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,320
Well, if anybody wants to hear what that sounds like,

616
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,500
that's the net.

617
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,680
You just described the next show, Radio Synesthesia.

618
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,400
Oh, yes, certainly.

619
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,200
It's an odd combination of many different sources and resources.

620
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,660
And it seems the populist leader, what's his name?

621
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,380
Antonin Karnatsky.

622
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,160
What the hell?

623
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,740
One of those guys.

624
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
He's about ready to resume power.

625
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,440
What are you talking about?

626
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
You don't get it?

627
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,820
The earthquake crisis in Armenia, I think it is.

628
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,480
Or maybe Venezuela and Ukraine.

629
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,200
It's in all of those places.

630
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,360
I haven't heard anything about Armenia lately.

631
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
I hear a lot about Ukraine lately.

632
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,440
Oh, yeah.

633
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,920
Well, that's the perfect answer if you can't really hear it.

634
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,980
The Ukraine is at war with Venezuela

635
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,580
and they're both revolting against their...

636
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,520
They're promoting a mass...

637
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,960
They're promoting something.

638
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,060
The monkey kings, they used to call them.

639
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,420
They're at least like seven foot tall giant monkeys.

640
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,260
They look like Yeti, but they're...

641
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,860
It was a little different.

642
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,400
And they used to rule the world so that everybody would...

643
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,820
Like thousands of people have to line up and bring them pies

644
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,300
and like orchids and different kinds of sandwiches and stuff.

645
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,600
And they put it down at their feet and everything like that.

646
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,100
And they, you know, eat some and leave.

647
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,120
And, man, we've certainly come a long way.

648
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,980
I'm not so sure.

649
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,800
I'm not so sure about that.

650
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,260
Has been launched by a sandwich.

651
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,540
Well, take out the neck bolts, you know, and what do you got going, you know?

652
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,340
A boltless Frankenstein, that's what you got.

653
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,800
Well, yeah, sure.

654
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,520
We're all crafted in a certain way and we all need juice of some kind.

655
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,380
Could just be coconut oil.

656
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,120
But that's not pertinent.

657
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,480
That's not pertinent.

658
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,160
I don't think.

659
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,560
Pertinent.

660
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,100
And, yes, we need something pertinent.

661
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Pertinent to what?

662
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,720
Oh, that's right.

663
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,040
We were mourning the passing of our friend who we don't really,

664
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,760
didn't really know all that well, actually.

665
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,340
Although, you know, last, the last devotional, was it?

666
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,820
Bob Casale came to the devotional and he not only talked

667
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,640
and kind of jammed with the band, the Spud Boys,

668
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,880
but he cooked for everybody.

669
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,220
It was at the Beachland Ballroom.

670
00:39:59,460 --> 00:39:59,900
Yeah, that's cool.

671
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,960
Which has a big kitchen.

672
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,900
And it turns out Reverend Bob, too,

673
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,020
is a gourmet cook and he cooked chicken cacciatore, I think,

674
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,660
for everyone there, which was about 80 people,

675
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,780
about as big as an X-Day, and about half of the same people.

676
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,840
I never really understood the chicken cacciatore thing.

677
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
That's one, too, for a keyboard guy.

678
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,540
Right.

679
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,200
And he put in, I did notice he put a lot of echo

680
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,020
because he's an engineer, you know, an audio engineer.

681
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,840
He put an extra bit of reverb into his,

682
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:51,340
you know, careful annoying eventually deny at a big function scale.

683
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,100


684
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
It ended completely in my head,

685
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,980
like I said, at the Isney

686
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,760
Poor man.

687
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,960
That's�in is single man.

688
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,540
skinny in the picture.

689
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,440
And then it sunk in.

690
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,420
Oh yeah, we were all that skinny then.

691
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,300
Because

692
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,240
in more recent years,

693
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,180
Bob Casale got more prosperous

694
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,520
looking, not unlike myself.

695
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,400
So what is it about the Cacciatore that puzzles

696
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,780
you, Dr. Sinister?

697
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,240
Oh.

698
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,340
What catches in your brain, should I say?

699
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,200
The word

700
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,640
catch and the word Cacciatore have something in common.

701
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,680
They have the same root.

702
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,360
I see.

703
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,460
I can't hear them talking about Cacciatore at all.

704
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,020
You don't hunt chickens.

705
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,380
I mean, I can hear them.

706
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,840
Cacciatore is like hunter's chicken, but who hunts

707
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,240
for chickens?

708
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,920
Chicken hawks.

709
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,860
Chicken hawks.

710
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,340
I say a chicken hawk

711
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,940
hunts a chicken.

712
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,280
That is an insult to my honor.

713
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,860
Foghorn leghorn.

714
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,100
You're not a chicken.

715
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,820
My daddy

716
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,740
told me about chickens.

717
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,700
You're not a chicken.

718
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,420
I say I am a chicken.

719
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,180
We saw a cartoon just a couple of days ago.

720
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,000
Yes, we did.

721
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,700
And now you can also do the entire

722
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,100
college-traveling project in the background

723
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,720
while we're doing the words or vice versa

724
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,600
and stuff like that.

725
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,640
Going back between Daffy and the goofy gambling buddies

726
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,980
of Daffy when they're on the skating pond.

727
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,720
That's a lovely, lovely world

728
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,800
you've escaped into.

729
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,220
Bob?

730
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,640
The other day I was eating some pork.

731
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,060
Roast.

732
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,380
And when I was done eating it, I actually said,

733
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
that's all folks.

734
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,500
It just came right out.

735
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,740
I saw a porky pig cartoon in which Sylvester or Daffy

736
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,560
or somebody was trying to insult him and said,

737
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,780
I your sister wears army boots and porky goes.

738
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,780
My sister didn't wear army boots.

739
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,200
My sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.

740
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,860
That's easier than smoking cold turkey.

741
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,760
Pull that off.

742
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,740
Taggy waggy.

743
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,820
But that got the old funny bone going.

744
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,380
That was...

745
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,400
Another thing we noticed is that

746
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,140
although Porky wears a jacket,

747
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,980
he has no pants on.

748
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,940
And nobody ever notices that.

749
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,880
They never say anything.

750
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,100
That reminds me of the time I walked out this week

751
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,000
and I wasn't wearing any underwear

752
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,200
and I had a rip in the back of my pants

753
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,960
and didn't know it.

754
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,140
And I think I might have scared some people.

755
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,900
You may have, Daffy.

756
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,680
You may have.

757
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,040
I'll have.

758
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,140
Okay.

759
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,900
I'm going to play another Devo's tune here

760
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,640
called Love is Stronger Than Dirt.

761
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,820
Whoa.

762
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,620
Well, that's an ever-present sentiment.

763
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,460
Okay.

764
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,060
Is it true?

765
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,920
I have seen Dirt get between lovers.

766
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,120
Well, this is just a way to listen for Devo

767
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,340
from a tent area.

768
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,840
The Devo's.

769
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,880
The Devo's.

770
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,180
The Devo's.

771
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,320
The Devo's.

772
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh, my goodness.

773
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,120
Start to take off and start to fly,

774
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,460
in a Holder,

775
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,780
far, far away.

776
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,880
Be coming to top any fortress,

777
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:26,880


778
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,420
Oh, I can reach the screw that can make a lot of noise.

779
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,800
Open the Opportunity.

780
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,520
Try to let goவ

781
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,300
isn't well,

782
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,540
right now.

783
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:31,880
All of a sudden,

784
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,140
There's another plane.

785
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,200
Love is proper today

786
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,820
Love is proper today

787
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,240
Love is proper today

788
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,040
And that was that

789
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,660
And that was great

790
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,760
Well that was well spoken

791
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,900
I liked it

792
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,360
Love is stronger than dirt

793
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,920
You know the lyrics made a lot of sense

794
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,300
To me as a teenage dancer

795
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,940
In an exotic nightclub

796
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,140
When I was only 14

797
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,980
And I was

798
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,620
Stronger than dirt

799
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,420
Pardon?

800
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,740
Stronger than dirt

801
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,320
Love is stronger than dirt

802
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:29,860
It said

803
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,740
But bacteria is stronger than anything

804
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,000
No vinegar is stronger than dirt

805
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,440
Especially in my case

806
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,160
As I

807
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,560
Visit the places they hide every day

808
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,060
I'm trying to think what I should play

809
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,100
For the last song

810
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,220
There's one on here called

811
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,040
Time Bomb

812
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
Which I think is about

813
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,600
Sex

814
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,260
I think a lot of the songs we've been

815
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,240
In fact pretty much all rock and roll

816
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,240
If sex is

817
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,760
If Time Bomb is an allusion to sex

818
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,740
Then I am thankful

819
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,780
That my sexuality

820
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,880
Is not a time bomb

821
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,100
Because you want a time bomb

822
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,820
To be predictable

823
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,900
You want to be able to predict

824
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,760
When the bomb is going to go off

825
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,820
And does anyone really operate

826
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,820
On a timer that precise

827
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,280
You know

828
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,820
Would you trust your life?

829
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,120
I guess there are professionals

830
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,420
Who can do that

831
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,500
In the pornography industry

832
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,200
Oh sure I could

833
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,180
If I wanted to

834
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,640
It's still $100 an hour

835
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,800
But it's the same kind of

836
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,320
Release mechanism

837
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,160
Afterwards

838
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:30,920
No I mean

839
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,560
Can somebody

840
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,000
Can somebody

841
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,880
You know

842
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,600
Present the money shot on cue

843
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,960
That's like you know

844
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,800
When the director says

845
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,540
Okay

846
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,480
Three

847
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,440
Two

848
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:39,980
One

849
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:41,800
Spooge

850
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,240
Yeah

851
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,780
Can that be done?

852
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,800
Yes I mean

853
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,860
If they can buy your thought

854
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,340
A yogi

855
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,060
Bob could do that

856
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,500
He could do that on command

857
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,840
But he would refuse to

858
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,920
You know yogis are all

859
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,320
Well Bob's not that kind of

860
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,100
Commando anymore

861
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,960
He's more like a

862
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,560
Sedentary bean

863
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,000
Connie could make him do it

864
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,060
It'd be like talking to a dog

865
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,180
Bob come

866
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,500
There you go

867
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,180
Yep

868
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,380
We're here to go

869
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,260
Connie is kind of

870
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,620
The deus ex machina though

871
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,040
Of

872
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,760
See

873
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,480
That

874
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,540
I can't hear Dr. Sinister

875
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,060
Deus

876
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,420
Sex

877
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,240
Machina

878
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,720
Deus sex machina

879
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,980
Back in the ancient amphitheaters

880
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,420
When the

881
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,240
When the

882
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,760
All else fails

883
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,640
Just to vote Connie

884
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,580
And everyone gets a happy

885
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,120
Blistening silver tube

886
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,640
And then this guy

887
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Would be riding on top

888
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,280
He'd be Zeus

889
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,680
And it'd be like his babes

890
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,460
And stuff like that

891
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,900
That's where

892
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,060
We got to go back

893
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,640
To the days of mythology

894
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
And promise everything

895
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,040
Under a thin veneer of lies

896
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,560
Under a thick fat

897
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,300
Thin veneer of lies

898
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,480
Isn't that what we've been doing

899
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,140
All this time

900
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:46,780
Anyway

901
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,180
A veneer of lies

902
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,260
So your lies are only skin deep

903
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,340
What kind of liar are you

904
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,600
A tissue of lies

905
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:54,780
It's pathetic

906
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,500
It's only desperation

907
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,340
That makes you

908
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,220
A snotty tissue

909
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,800
Or a snotty used tissue of lies

910
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,980
Necrotized tissue

911
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:01,980


912
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,360
A disgusting

913
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,460
Grotty old

914
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,000
Handkerchief of lies

915
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,160
You've got to be alive

916
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,120
A beastly rag

917
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,480
A smut of

918
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,280
Indiscriminate size

919
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,400
Worn by everyone on Tuesday

920
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Especially with

921
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,840
The bands in town

922
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,660
Do you remember the band

923
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,420
The stangy

924
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,240
Old stangy boy

925
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,240
And that

926
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,880
We were in

927
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,720
Public school together

928
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,440
Band of Brothers

929
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:28,960
Sure

930
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,780
B.O.B.

931
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,220
That was a code name

932
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,700
For the

933
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,400
Assassins for Bob

934
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,180
Yep

935
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,860
And what a beautiful time

936
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,980
That was

937
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,180
You just said it on the radio

938
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,220
The sun was glistening outside

939
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,280
I'm not supposed to say

940
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,880
Assassins on the radio

941
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,080
You just said ass twice

942
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,220
You just said it on the phone

943
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,460
Four times

944
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,560
You could say it

945
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,340
Such asses for saying that

946
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,320
No you have to say asses

947
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,520
No

948
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,500
It's okay as long as you're referring

949
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,220
To a jackass or a butt

950
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,320
Well the one per radio

951
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,360
Personality who's now national

952
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,700
Who's show you were on and stuff

953
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,860
Likes to call everyone

954
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,740
He doesn't like ass clowns now

955
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,200
I was not really familiar

956
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,920
With that phrase

957
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,000
For a long period of time

958
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,460
I know that

959
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,100
Must have heard it somewhere

960
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,920
But is that common usage

961
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
You ass clown

962
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,460
Ass hat

963
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,500
It has been for quite a while

964
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,320
It came after ass hat

965
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,500
It sounds archaic yes

966
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,500
Maybe anti

967
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,640
Or pre-Diluvian

968
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,260
Well I mean the kids

969
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,480
Were probably saying it

970
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,380
A long time ago

971
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,060
Back in the

972
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,960
Back in the 80s

973
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,760
The Beastie Boys

974
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,060
Had a song called Ass Monkey

975
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,480
With anything that reminds you

976
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,280
Of the id

977
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,920
You know like

978
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,460
A forbidden planet or something

979
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,700
Getting ready to blow up the world

980
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,060
Cause you're so P.O'd

981
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,880
I know I can't say the real world

982
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,500
No you're right

983
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,680
Don't say real world

984
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,740
Oh I did it

985
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,660
Don't say anything real

986
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,840
On a subgenius show

987
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,180
Don't kick me off the air

988
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,280
You decide what's real

989
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,040
And what's not

990
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,220
Real real real real real real real

991
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,560
Leave it

992
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,580
Please

993
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,380
For mercy

994
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,160
That cry in the wilderness

995
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,320
Will affect anything

996
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,760
Will change the world

997
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,380
The way it is

998
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,560
Not like my friends

999
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,880
Now things are gonna continue

1000
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,140
To tumble for a while

1001
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,240
Before they start to

1002
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,220
Shake out just fine

1003
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,480
What he said

1004
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,460
Yeah what he said

1005
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,960
If he said it

1006
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,880
Then you better pick up on it

1007
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,820
Yeah man

1008
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,360
Man

1009
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,640
Can't be unsaid

1010
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,960
How many among us

1011
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,220
Could claim that title though

1012
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,740
The title of man

1013
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,040
No the title of

1014
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,580
Um

1015
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,100
Princely dupe

1016
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,060
Don't shoot

1017
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,120
I'm a man

1018
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,820
That was one of the new

1019
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,900
You know Devo put out a new album

1020
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,460
Like last year

1021
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,240
Or the year before

1022
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,620
Yes they did

1023
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,920
And we played some of them

1024
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,980
In fact I played that

1025
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,840
Please Baby Please

1026
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,260
Was on that new

1027
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,220
That was like two or three years ago now

1028
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,360
Yeah well you know

1029
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,280
When you're my age

1030
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,700
Time flies

1031
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,520
A year is like a week

1032
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:01,760
Yes

1033
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,740
I'm actually

1034
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,840
I just recently moved into that

1035
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,040
Yeah you're on

1036
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,880
Dinosaur time actually

1037
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,580
I am

1038
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,320
I am

1039
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,120
Well you know why that happens

1040
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,800
Not enough milestones

1041
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,420
A chronic mystery

1042
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,540
And a sad conclusion

1043
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,320
Not enough what

1044
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,580
Not enough milestones

1045
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,520
In your life

1046
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,440
Oh I'm sorry

1047
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,000
If you have more

1048
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,700
Milestone events in your life

1049
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,280
In old age

1050
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,920
Then a year

1051
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,220
Will seem longer

1052
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,620
Do kidney stones count

1053
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,100
Yeah

1054
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,340
Well your first one counts

1055
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,580
What only up to five

1056
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,840
What are you talking about

1057
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,420
My kidney stone

1058
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,400
Can sing

1059
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,860
The Star Spangled Banner

1060
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:31,980
Wow

1061
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,440
Yeah well

1062
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,020
My algorithm

1063
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,500
Is

1064
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,800
You sound like

1065
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,620
I'm having a stroke again

1066
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:37,940
I'm sorry

1067
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,260
When I passed my first stone

1068
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:39,760
I was singing

1069
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,800
The Star Spangled Banner

1070
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,880
To take my mind off the pain

1071
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,160
Actually I've never

1072
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,720
Passed a stone

1073
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,320
Well I dreamed

1074
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,240
Bob Casale

1075
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,360
Was actually singing

1076
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,200
The Canadian National Anthem

1077
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,480
At the

1078
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,980
I guess

1079
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,820
It was the

1080
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,680
You know why

1081
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,200
You know why

1082
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,260
The Canadians won

1083
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,160
The Golden Hockey

1084
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:57,760
It's a big hockey game

1085
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
And there's guys

1086
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,380
Talking with people

1087
00:52:59,380 --> 00:52:59,740
All day

1088
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,440
You know the

1089
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,760
The whole action stuff

1090
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,320
And everything

1091
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,040
And it was all like

1092
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,940
Oh it was great

1093
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,900
Well I'm gonna play

1094
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,260
Say what

1095
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:08,820
I was gonna say

1096
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,280
The real reason

1097
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,820
The Canadians

1098
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,360
Won so much gold

1099
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,320
In hockey this year

1100
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,300
Or any year

1101
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,940
For that matter

1102
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,700
The Olympic Fan Fair

1103
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,960
And O Canada

1104
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,380
Open with the same notes

1105
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,500
Da da da da

1106
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,140
And then what comes next

1107
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,780
Well it's either

1108
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,720
The Olympic Fan Fair

1109
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Or it's O Canada

1110
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,080
I don't know

1111
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,480
Well I know

1112
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,160
That I've had

1113
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,800
Enough of this

1114
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,400
Bad singing by us

1115
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,200
And I'm gonna put

1116
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,000
This last unheard

1117
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,740
Devo song

1118
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,440
Time Bomb

1119
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,280
Which I think

1120
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,140
Is about sex

1121
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,460
This is the

1122
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,160
Hour of Slack

1123
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,700
From Church of the Subgenius

1124
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,460
We were talking about

1125
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,320
A different Bob

1126
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,440
Than usual tonight

1127
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,120
But

1128
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,740
What the hey

1129
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,020
As they say

1130
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,460
Still unusual

1131
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,660
