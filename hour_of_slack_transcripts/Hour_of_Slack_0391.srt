1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,940
Lately, the radio hasn't exactly been your friend, has it?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,280
Most of those stations are run by corporate cannibals you wouldn't even bother to grind into plant food

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,380
because the resulting slurry would probably turn the garden into a dust bowl.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,740
The pop drivel, the whining country trash, the rap crap, the screeching contests, the machine gun news reports.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,560
In a high-speed psycho world like this one, you need that kind of withering input like you need a tattoo of Hitler on your forehead.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,840
But where can you turn for programming that'll stimulate the mind and soothe the weary soul?

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,000
Where in the vast broadcast wasteland can you go for a cool drink of intellectual water that'll cut the psychic dust in your mind's throat?

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,800
Why, you turn to the almighty subgenius Hour of Slack every Sunday night at 9 on that electromagnetic powerhouse,

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,260
KNON, 89.3 FM in frantic yet beautiful Dallas, Texas.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,600
Put your fevered soul in the clawed yet loving hands of self-appointed soothsayer, Reverend Ivan Stang,

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,080
and slide into a world of comfort that puts the skids on your plunge into psychosis with a volley of morbid yet irresistible yucks and guffaws.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,000
Is your ears be playing tricks on you? No, it's merely the subgenius Hour of Slack, relief unbounded for a society on the verge.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,460
Praise Bob and do it now.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:26,380
Hello, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack, KNON needs your help.

15
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,060
Send in those pledges.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,020
And praise Bob.

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,360
Stop.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,880
All of you.

19
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,620
Be silent.

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:45,120
You people of this planet, you must not use force.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,340
Can somebody tell me what the Sam Hill is going on around here?

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,280
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebrief.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,940
A cascade of a...

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,560
astounding mystery.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,420
Supernatural bridges and a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,580
I don't want to go on.

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,060
It will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,020
Let's get the hell out of here.

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,860
We have such sights to show you.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Shit.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,700
Now I warn you.

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:39,800
There are powers in the universe beyond anything you know.

33
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,980
It's a dream.

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
It's a dream.

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,980
It's a dream.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,180
It's a dream.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
It's a dream.

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,760
It's a dream.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,580
It's a dream.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,140
It's a dream.

41
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,360
It's a dream.

42
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,380
It's a dream.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,960
It's a dream.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,180
This is just a mythical universe.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Why?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,520
Who are you, and who are you?

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,540
Why'd you focus your life in this dream?

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,940
You found yourself in this deep dolorous anthrop tireless pit.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Dis injustly on your own because of evil.

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,100
MeditatingJulienstheta need not contracted yours or your Mother's mind.

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,640
Don't murk your mind.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,000
Get a blow to you all.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Now,

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,120
Die for it.

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,200
Hush now. Everything's all right.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,980
Come to daddy.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,160
Bob?

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,100
Bob is sex.

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,080
That's your key phrase. It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,440
We are controlling transmission.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,140
Hey, what's going on here?

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,160
The subgenius.

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Our old swag.

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,840
Here's your host.

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,420
Who sits on the right-hand side of Bob?

66
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,920
None other than the Reverend.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,500
Reverend Ivan Stang.

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,700
It's me.

69
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,980
It's really me.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,240
It's dangerous.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,520
It opens doors.

72
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,880
What kind of doors?

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,180
Doors to the pleasures of heaven or hell.

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
I didn't care which.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,100
I thought I'd gone to the limits.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,800
I hadn't.

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,060
The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond the limits.

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,320
Pain and pleasure.

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,080
Indivisible.

80
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,200
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

81
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,560
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,760
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,860
Cometsuckers let Bob into your life.

84
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,100
Big bad Bob.

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm going to live and you're going to help me, yes?

86
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,940
Yes.

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,240
Perfect.

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,660
You're going to have to learn as much as you have to learn.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
You must explore.

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,900
You must reach out.

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,660
Go to your home.

92
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:46,420
Go and give thought to the mysteries of the universe.

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Man, do you know where you are?

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,220
No.

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,540
No.

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,160
No.

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,220


98
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:05,300
You aren't saying that because you're going to-

99
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,940
Where are you going?

100
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,420
You didn't, do you know what he said?

101
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,420


102
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,820
They say that there is no mercy when a man выйes because of his murder,

103
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


104
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


105
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:09,820


106
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,920
You are still not that much older than me, if you are brave enough now.

107
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,640
I'm a young man with who just started talking back at this point, freedom.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,560
Everybody has a soul.

109
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,340
We can use that.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
You can find something to take.

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,080
You'll find something.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,760
Hmm.

114
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,160
And really, whatever's in your purse would be helpful.

115
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,080
Do you have to be in good health for this?

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
No, not at all.

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,180
Not at all.

118
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,160
In fact, this is a church for people that are generally regarded as being in very poor mental health.

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,720
I see.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,760
I see.

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,560
And you're the leader, right?

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,500
No, I am merely a spokesperson for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,300
He is a reverend in the Church of the Sub-Genius.

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,500
I write a lot of Bob's PR and speeches.

125
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,200
I see.

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
I'll tell you what.

127
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,720
We've got to run.

128
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
We've got other calls.

129
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,780
Let's continue on.

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,360
We're going to know.

131
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,800
The horrible, perverse God is laughing at his truth.

132
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,300
It stays the same.

133
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,660
From what I've told you about Bob, you think he sounds okay to you?

134
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,380
Yeah, I guess.

135
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,960
You're not sure?

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,860
Only one thing I'm sure of.

137
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,840
What's that?

138
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,740
Lucky.

139
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, but incidentally, the question is, Reverend Jones, you know about that cult.

140
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,100
You didn't agree with...

141
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,600
Jim Jones?

142
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,380
Right.

143
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Yes, yes.

144
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,640
We used to deal with him.

145
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,920
Bob learned a lot from him.

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
But you're not with him.

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,120
You welcome other races in your church, right?

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,900
Well, are you talking about Jim Jones?

149
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Right, the one I killed.

150
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,940
He killed a lot of blacks, but, you know, anybody...

151
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,120
He didn't kill anybody.

152
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,620
He wasn't...

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,560
He wasn't really particular about that.

154
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,560
He wasn't all there.

155
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,320
No.

156
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,120
No, he definitely wasn't.

157
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,560
He used the wrong formula in that Kool-Aid, see?

158
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,760
Those people were supposed to get eternal slack, and then it didn't work out that way.

159
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Slack instead of slack.

160
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,760
Yeah.

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah, that was supposed to give them eternal slack, and it didn't.

162
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,280
Okay, when did your church start, Reverend?

163
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, Bob Dobbs was seized by...

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,620
seized up in the spirit and saw vision from Jehovah's...

165
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,120
Jehovah's Pandora.

166
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,120


167
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,700
Take that.

168
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,380
So he drag on...

169
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,080
He took Walter.

170
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,300
Huh?

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,360


172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,500
And started Ank accol moved around theило for HL known for?

173
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,540
Wow,

174
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,640
were you ''島''-like?

175
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah

176
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah.

177
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:41,840


178
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:50,660
Of course it's been, ever since then, we've, well it's been a tale of endless slack and horror.

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,820
...callers, they're all over the outside of the ship, they'll be frozen!

180
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,200
Well they won't get in, they're little fumbling hands.

181
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,080
Look there's a fuzzy little puff of collar down there on the right rocket motor.

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,760
Get him!

183
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,060
Thank you, thank you.

184
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
Oh boy.

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
I think the collar seal's broken.

186
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,180
Ah, who would have thought that there were...

187
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,180
The seal's on that facelift that blew up, no way to get it loaded.

188
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,400
Uh oh, navigational officer's killing the callers.

189
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,920
Yeah, he's smiting them and squashing them, one by one, like the insects they resemble from this altitude.

190
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Doug, listen, I don't have long to talk. I think they're coming for me.

191
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,720
So, all the plans have changed. I've gotta leave the country by Friday.

192
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:57,360
Uh, I'm gonna be in Europe somewhere, and uh, I don't know what you're supposed to do.

193
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,820
Uh, I think Dob said something about going to South America, but uh, who can say?

194
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,140
Um, oh god, I don't know, they already got Wellman and...

195
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,460
...the news. I think, I think Hal turned them in.

196
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,680
Uh, so, here they come.

197
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,640
Without that deadly talent for being in the right place at the right time, evil must suffer defeat.

198
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:45,360
Unlike its opposite good, evil has allowed no human healings, no miscalculations.

199
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,080
Evil must be perfect, or depend upon the imperfections of others.

200
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,880
I'd like to ask him a question or two.

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,600
You too? Yeah, go ahead.

202
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,240
How can I be saved in the year 1998?

203
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Uh, it's very, very simple. You just have a membership card identifying yourself as a minister in the church of the Lord.

204
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,160


205
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,520
You have the subgenius in your pocket.

206
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,300
Yeah?

207
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:24,720
So, we're not in any hurry to recruit people. We figure that around 1997 we'll start getting, as the earthquakes and volcanoes start happening in, in all over the country, in the world...

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,140
...we'll just automatically, people will understand that Bob is their last hope.

209
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
Yeah. I see.

210
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,540
Okay, and um...

211
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,300
It's only $20 for the, uh, ordination papers.

212
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,740
Yeah? So, so it's...

213
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,140
And a few other propaganda papers.

214
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,580
Yeah, propaganda, what's that?

215
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,860
So, $20 will buy you eternal salvation, then?

216
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,740
Eternal salvation or triple your money back, my friend.

217
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,180
I see.

218
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,100
No other church or cult makes that claim.

219
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,020
Well, I would certainly trust a cult that made that claim.

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,020
Dr. Howell, what's your question?

221
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,260
Well, I didn't have a question. I was just calling up to say, God love you, you crazy, beautiful bastard.

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
I just love your program.

223
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,120
Yeah.

224
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,140
And I love everything you do, you know? Your fun-loving monkey shines and eye pollutants...

225
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Is this a plant call?

226
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,160
Hygiene.

227
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,800
Yeah, I love you. Anything you do is okay in my book, but do I have to get a lawyer to make you stop harassing me?

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Hey, hey, hey, listen up, listen up.

229
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,600
...you're gonna pass it over to the guys at the right now for a lawyer's position.

230
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:34,100
Well, when you put it that way, it makes it seem all the more remarkable that you were so forbearing and thoughtful about our creature culture.

231
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,500
But I just wanted to say that, uh...

232
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,680
Oh, okay.

233
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
One of these days, I'll be there.

234
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,420
I'll be back on the show. By God, I tell you, you kids, you're wonderful, I love you, you're beautiful.

235
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,800
Can you describe to us what you can see from your orbit out there?

236
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,900
Well, it's, uh, kind of, looks kind of like a green mold from this high up. You'd think that it was a mighty civilization pulsating on holy life.

237
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,800
It looks more like the kind of green mold you might see on a cucumber that you leave out of the fridge too long.

238
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,140
But it's actually all that we hold dear and cherish in our heart.

239
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,520
That's certainly true.

240
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,620
And are you undergoing boy-yo-yoing and, uh, baby-ation tonight?

241
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,440
Yes, it's all over the place.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
But we have very, very many tonight listening. Thousands and thousands. Look at them, Hal!

243
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,820
Oh, my God, what a disgusting sight. What a mess of man.

244
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,540
This Hal spins around the Earth at higher and higher speeds. He sees you little listeners trying to call, trying to call in.

245
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,200
Hold on, Hal, we'll be right back. Good God, what's happening?

246
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,400
What are you doing?

247
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,460
We're trying to fix the show.

248
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
Why are you doing that to me?

249
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,280
Just a silly idea.

250
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,060
Because there's nothing else to do, Hal.

251
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
Here, would you like to look at some drawings, Hal?

252
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,300
Hey, you want to play some chess, Hal?

253
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,760
Hey, don't shut down the other guys, Hal.

254
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,480
Hey, okay, Mobius, let's go inside this, uh, life containment center.

255
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,660
I think Hal's gone crazy. I mean, I can't say that out here.

256
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,460
...simulated smattering of wisdom...

257
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh, no, look, look, look what happened to Hal.

258
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,060
...drugs...

259
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,040
Hi, uh, the fellow from Texas?

260
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,640
Yeah, Reverend Stang.

261
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:12,140
Reverend Stang, uh, you, you, you, uh, refer to your incubation period as 1953?

262
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,360
Well, I think it sort of started fermenting in Bob's brain about that time.

263
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,620
And how old was, was he when he, uh, fermented this, uh, this discovery?

264
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,460
The, the teachings of flack?

265
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,920
Yeah.

266
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,780
Oh, he was probably in his, uh, early 20s. It's really hard to say.

267
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,620
Bob is as old as the mountain in his youth.

268
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,740
He's as young as the streams, you might say.

269
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,160
He's sort of ageless. There have always been Bobs, all through history.

270
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,760
Uh-huh.

271
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,880
Not all of them were good Bobs, like the one we have now.

272
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
There have been evil Bobs.

273
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:59,320
So, so, Reverend, would it, would it be, um, would it be okay to say, or is it a good analogy to say that, uh, Bob is to slack as, uh, say, Lassie is to television?

274
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,320
As, as to, as Lassie is to television?

275
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,020
Well, I mean, there've, there've been a lot of different Lassies as well. Some better than others.

276
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,200
Right, right.

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,680
Oh, yeah, you can get, you don't have to have Bob to have Flack. You can, you can get Flack without Bob.

278
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,260
Okay.

279
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,780
But, Bob is the only one who can really teach you to think for yourself.

280
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,160
Okay.

281
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,680
Uh, uh, uh, Mr. Texas?

282
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Right.

283
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,180
Oh, Mr. Texas.

284
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,980
No, I'm not Mr. Texas.

285
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,280
Reverend Stang?

286
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,560
Yeah.

287
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,020
Reverend Stang.

288
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,260
Sifida here in Connecticut has some interesting guests.

289
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:46,720
Sometimes we wonder, how do you make your living and how do you account for the IRS?

290
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,640
Do you have tax returns?

291
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,420
Is the Church of the Subgenius a tax-exempt donation?

292
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,300
No, no.

293
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,520
The church is the world's first industrial church.

294
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,940
Bob does not believe that people should have to subsidize religions they might not believe in.

295
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,300
Besides that, the IRS wouldn't give us a tax-exempt status anyway.

296
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:23,320
But believe me, you more than make up in slack what you would continue to lose in your taxes.

297
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,840
So it is a monetarily-based, capitalistic church.

298
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Oh, absolutely.

299
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,440
Bob is all-American.

300
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,180
I mean, this is like capitalism taken to its furthest extreme,

301
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,900
and it's proof of just how free we are in this country to get away with just about anything.

302
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,440
Uh-huh. I see.

303
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,740
Praise Bob.

304
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,780
Praise Bob.

305
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,320
And the more you pay, the more salvation and the more slack you will have.

306
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,140
Well, the more years of eternity in the subgenius heaven or hell.

307
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,780
Uh-huh.

308
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,600
Uh-huh.

309
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,880
Uh, depending on what you want, you know.

310
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,320
I see.

311
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,940
Okay.

312
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,600
Uh, so Christ and Moses in heaven.

313
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,420
I don't know where it is.

314
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,140
I know it's not up there.

315
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,680
Because I believe that the earth revolves.

316
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,900
And sometimes you can go to heaven at 12.07.

317
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,800
You can go to hell at 6.30.

318
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,800
You're going in for a book, right?

319
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,840
Hell is to the left.

320
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:23,780
Yeah.

321
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,800
Maybe right now.

322
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,000
So, okay.

323
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,060
Christ and Moses.

324
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,620
Look at the earth.

325
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,440
And they say, well.

326
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,780
Obviously the book is bombing down there.

327
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Gideons are shoving it in motel drawers.

328
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,280
And that's it.

329
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,160
Through usage, yeah.

330
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,220
It's lost impact.

331
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,400
Give us this day out there.

332
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah, usage becomes trite then.

333
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,280
Like, good night.

334
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,340
It doesn't mean good night.

335
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
The guy said good night to me, isn't it?

336
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,380
No, it's really a contraction.

337
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:56,900
Good night.

338
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,280
Good night.

339
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,080
Good night.

340
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,300
Good night.

341
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,440
Good night.

342
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,020
Good night.

343
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,320
Good night.

344
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,600
Good night.

345
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,900
Good night.

346
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,300
Good night.

347
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,500


348
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Good night.

349
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:00,980
Good night.

350
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:00,980


351
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:00,980


352
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:00,980


353
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:00,980


354
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,740
Thank you?

355
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,700
Does thank you mean, oh, thank you.

356
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,680
If anyone here said thank you to you, really, you'd go, oh, thank you.

357
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,840
He'd talk us like a good old jank who'd thank you.

358
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,480
Yeah.

359
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,180
So you're going to Bible usage.

360
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,580
You see.

361
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,980
Do a rewrite on it, definitely.

362
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,260
It's about time for that.

363
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:17,960
Yeah.

364
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,040
Certain things are complete superstition.

365
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,360
Have no validity at all in the Bible.

366
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,280
Yeah.

367
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,540
They're just the antithesis of everything that is correct intellectually.

368
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,500
but some of the basic things heavy beautiful so they'll make the earth

369
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,400
that's it Christ was come down Saturday shul day synagogue day let's make all

370
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:45,200
the shoes are second-day have new shoes real shoes shoes that the gypsies took

371
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,220
over because it was storefront synagogues now the gypsies are cooking

372
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:58,240
there so now there we go the west coast see there's what kind of shoes like did

373
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,920
you see the Sullivan show that had um so I mean you want it what was he doing

374
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,240
let's say I mean you're reading the Bible Luther Adler and then he got

375
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,200
really it got even too heavy-handed for Sullivan because he copped out later

376
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,940
they got

377
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,200
oh my goodness

378
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,400
like Sal Meno is reading the Bible.

379
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm looking at this answer, strange.

380
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,740
Now Sullivan comes out and he goes,

381
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,460
I don't want people to think that this reflects the tenor of Exodus.

382
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,500
What he was telling the people is it's not that dull, boring crap in the Bible, you know.

383
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,300
Ben Hurst flips Esther a lot.

384
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
There's a lot of kids in the picture and it's really horny, but don't.

385
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,420
That's what he said.

386
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,120
He said, you know, people get the impression that it's really, that's what he said.

387
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,080
It's dull.

388
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,180
Songs of Esther really hasten.

389
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,400
That's a beautiful part of the Bible.

390
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay.

391
00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:00,040
West Coast, Christ and Moses will make reformed shuls, reformed rabbis.

392
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,680
So reformed, they're ashamed they're Jewish.

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,780
And they got a different sound.

394
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,800
It's a typical reformed rabbi sound.

395
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,500
Service, right?

396
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,900
1201 Saturday night.

397
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,780
When did you accept that the children of Israel?

398
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,040
Ha ha, Israel.

399
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,240
Where is Israel?

400
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,040
Is yonder Israel?

401
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,520
Out quench on flaming yurt-side candle Israel.

402
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,340
That is the Israel of Chabellion David and Ruth and Sherilam and Joy.

403
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,700
Oh, rabbi, that was a beautiful speech.

404
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,660
Dank shalom.

405
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,420
I like that with the tiff top my head.

406
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, yeah.

407
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,700
All right, now.

408
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,900
Sender.

409
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,280
Sender.

410
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,980
Christ the most.

411
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,860
This is fly to New York.

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,640
France, continental.

413
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,960
$88 to Chicago.

414
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,400
$35.

415
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,120
All right.

416
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,460
All right, now, let's see what they would make.

417
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,700
They'd probably make, is it what's playing in St. Pat's?

418
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,120
Good double bill, Spellman and Sheen.

420
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,680
That's okay.

421
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,240
That's okay.

422
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,840
That's okay.

423
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,620
Oh, Mr. Spellman.

424
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,460
Oh, Mr. Sheen.

425
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,780
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

426
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
Oh, okay.

427
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,980
Now, Christ and Moses are both possessed humility.

428
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,600
Why?

429
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,560
Wisdom.

430
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,220
That's it.

431
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:16,900
Anybody?

432
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,700
Anybody who is secure, there's never any hostility, because he's cool.

433
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,040
Anyone who is above you even is.

434
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,620
So they just stand on the back of St. Patrick's.

435
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,880
And they'd listen, look around.

436
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,960
Cardinal Spellman would be relating love and giving and forgiveness to the people.

437
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,660
And Christ would be confused, because their route took them through Spanish Harlem.

438
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,860
And you would wonder what 40 Puerto Ricans were doing living in one room.

439
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,020
This guy had a ring on it.

440
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,720
It was worth eight grand.

441
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,860
And he would wonder at the grandeur.

442
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
See, why aren't the Puerto Ricans living here?

443
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
It's clean and nice.

444
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
And what does it all mean?

445
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,820
And they'd just be shucking back and forth and talking.

446
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,520
And maybe Bishop Sheen would see them back there and run up to Spellman on the lectern

447
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
and, psst, I want to talk to you for a minute.

448
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,500
Would you go back to the Blackboard and stop bugging me now?

449
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,400
I want to talk to her.

450
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,060
I've got to go.

451
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,060


452
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,020
I've got a custom in the back.

453
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,380
All right, put the choir on for 10 minutes.

454
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,500
What is it?

455
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,420
What is it?

456
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,980
You'll never guess who's here.

457
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,480
Who's here?

458
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,060
You're not going to believe me.

459
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,880
You're going to think I've been drinking.

460
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,100
All right, who's here?

461
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,920
Christ and Moses.

462
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,480
Are you putting me on now?

463
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,040
I'm telling you about Jesus.

464
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,040


465
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,040


466
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,220
Oh, I have to show you.

467
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,440
What's this?

468
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,080
Are you sure it's them?

469
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,220
Well, I've just seen them in pictures, but I'm pretty sure it's them.

470
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,700
Moses is a ringer for Charlton Heston, I'm sure.

471
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,640
Hmm.

472
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,640
Where are they standing?

473
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,520
In the back.

474
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,320
Don't look now, you idiot.

475
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,020
They can see us.

476
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,380
Christ and Moses, both here.

477
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,960
The way in the back.

478
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,240
Did Christ bring the family?

479
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,080
What's his mother's name?

480
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,820
That's weird.

481
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,740
I read the book today too.

482
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,340
I'm so nervous.

483
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,040
Mary.

484
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,880
Mary what?

485
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,020
Mary what?

486
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,020


487
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,440
I don't know, Mary, Mary Hale?

488
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,720
No, uh, Hail Mary, Mary Hale.

489
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,220
Hail Mary?

490
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,860
Harry Mary?

491
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,940
No, I don't know what that looks like.

492
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,560
Oh, yeah.

493
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,620
Hail Mary, oh, Hail Mary Full of Grace Thompson.

494
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,820
They're very thick with the duponts on a Montreux point.

495
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,540
They're back here, yes.

496
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,340
All right.

497
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,980
All right, yeah, it's on there.

498
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
If this ever gets around now.

499
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,480
It has.

500
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Oh, Christ, don't look in the front door.

501
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,380
The lepers are coming.

502
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,000
All right.

503
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,280
Uh, oh, yeah.

504
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,160
Uh, sir, uh, would you take the bell off, please?

505
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,980
Thank you very much.

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,300
All right.

507
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,980
Wait, mister, will you pick up your leg, madam, your nose, your...

508
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,600
Thank you.

509
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,500
Uh, all right.

510
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,980
Uh, they've got Sophie Tucker with Moses posing.

511
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,580
Take that Hebrew National Banner down.

512
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,360
Mr. Jesse, will you get off the Madonna?

513
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,160
That's not a stat.

514
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,080
All right, give me a direct line to Rome, quickly.

515
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,580
Rome.

516
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,340
All right.

517
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,260
Hello.

518
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,860
Hello.

519
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,520
John Friend in New York.

520
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,880
Listen, a couple of kids dropped in.

521
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,320
Uh, yeah, you know them.

522
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,180
Well, I can't really talk right now.

523
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,360
Excuse me.

524
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,640
Hello, we're from Newsweek, and we want to know if they have State Department clearance,

525
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,800
and is that really them?

526
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,420
Well, I'm yes, it is them.

527
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Sonny, get off my hand.

528
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,580
Yes, that is them, dear, yes.

529
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,460
I don't know if they're going to do any tricks today.

530
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,220
I don't know.

531
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
Yes, they can fly.

532
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,420
No, Mary Martin isn't God's mother.

533
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,420
Get the hell out of here now.

534
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,100
Hello.

535
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,240
Oh, you know them.

536
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,900
One kid is, well, I'll...

537
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,660
With a cross on...

538
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,920
No, not Zorro.

539
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,440
Damn, that's right.

540
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,180
He brought a very attractive Jewish boy with him.

541
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,540
Oh, he got to do something.

542
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,340
I don't know.

543
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,740
I can't put him up at your place.

544
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,600
No, I didn't paint or anything.

545
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,360
Oh, I got a lot of kids staying over here.

546
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,980
Look, what are we paying protection for?

547
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,320
That's right.

548
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,480
Just get him over here, that's all.

549
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,640
I don't want to hear about that.

550
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,880
Look, all I know is that we're up to our a**.

551
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,720
And crutches and wheelchairs.

552
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,620
Is that good enough for you?

553
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
That place is ridiculous here.

554
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,020
Yeah.

555
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,300
Yeah.

556
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,120
They're in the back.

557
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,400
Way in the back.

558
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,460
Of course they're white.

559
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,700
Yeah.

560
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,560
Yeah.

561
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,620
Yeah.

562
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,600
This is New York.

563
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,960
Puerto Ricans stand in the back.

564
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,200
That's right.

565
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,300
I don't know which ones are they, Sheen.

566
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,160
The ones that are glowing.

567
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,140
Yeah.

568
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,200
Yeah.

569
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,140
I don't know.

570
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,060
I don't know.

571
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
What goes wrong with me?

572
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,820
Oh, the office.

573
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,620
Some guys there that are out to get me.

574
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,960
And then at home, I don't know.

575
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,280
My wife.

576
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,540
Oh, the kids, you know, everything.

577
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,300
And then there's the payments due on the car.

578
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,060
Oh, no.

579
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,440
Well, I'm just telling you, I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.

580
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,260
I mean, really.

581
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,420
I wonder if it's worth even trying.

582
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,840
What am I killing myself for like this?

583
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,280
What am I...

584
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,300
I don't know.

585
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,760
Oh, if I had any brains.

586
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,860
That's the trouble.

587
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
I've got the brains.

588
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,380
But I don't know.

589
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,400
Maybe it's my attitude.

590
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,620
It's wrong or something.

591
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:39,960


592
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,700
Nothing happens.

593
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,340
I figured I'd be.

594
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,060


595
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,700
Something in the office by this time.

596
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,360
Everybody gets pushed up ahead of me.

597
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,800
And that, of course, and then there's the wife and the kids.

598
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,760
And the trouble.

599
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,380
The car.

600
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,400
Yeah, and there's...

601
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,700
I don't know.

602
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,600
Oh.

603
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,080
Let's have another drink.

604
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,300
The pepper will sing.

605
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,360
Oh, stop it.

606
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,380
You're killing me.

607
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,120
See, it makes me feel much better.

608
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,660
Just talking to you.

609
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,880
Anytime, baby.

610
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,940
Anytime.

611
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,640
Anytime.

612
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,660
Oh.

613
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,400
Oh.

614
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,620
Oh.

615
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,940
Oh.

616
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh.

617
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,540
Oh.

618
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,840
Oh.

619
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,160
Oh.

620
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,200
Oh.

621
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,760
Oh.

622
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,380


623
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:44,680
Oh.

624
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:44,680


625
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:44,680


626
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:44,960
Oh.

627
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,440
Oh.

628
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,440


629
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,500
Oh.

630
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,500


631
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,500


632
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,500


633
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,520
Oh.

634
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,520


635
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,040
Oh.

636
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


637
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


638
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


639
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


640
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


641
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


642
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


643
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


644
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


645
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


646
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


647
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


648
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,040


649
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Oh, yeah.

650
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,100
That's...

651
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,300
That was Ken Nordean.

652
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,180
And that's...

653
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,600
That's how the conspiracies made me feel too, friends.

654
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,160
I don't know why I keep calling you friends.

655
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
I don't have any friends.

656
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,140
Nobody has any friends.

657
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,460
All we have are bosses and customers.

658
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,660
All the rest of it's bluff.

659
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,840
Pure bluff.

660
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,360
It's like on that Fireside Theater record.

661
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
We're all just faking being interested in each other as human beings.

662
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,020
All we're interested in is finding people.

663
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,900
People we can hate for making less money than us.

664
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,220
Because we already hate those that make more money than us.

665
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,840
But at least we feel like they're justified.

666
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,620
The other day I read about this guard that was driving a money truck.

667
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,260
One of those big armored trucks loaded with money.

668
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,580
And he had to put on the...

669
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
This is a true story.

670
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,300
He had to put on the brakes real fast.

671
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,760
And this giant sack of quarters, $25,000 in quarters,

672
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,000
busts loose.

673
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,560
When he put on the brakes and slammed against him and crushed him to death.

674
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,120
Crushed under quarters.

675
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,660
Slack friends.

676
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,220
Friends.

677
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,040
That guy got him.

678
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Not as close to slack as any of us are going to get.

679
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,320
God's gotten to where I can't even hate the conspiracy anymore.

680
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
At least they make money.

681
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,900
I can hate myself.

682
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
My money ran out.

683
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,300
I haven't gotten any more yet.

684
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,160
Since I can't make any money when I hate myself this much,

685
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,900
I guess that means...

686
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm out of money for good, huh?

687
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,000
The only thing that could make me like myself would be money.

688
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,560
That doesn't mean I'll like you if you have money.

689
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,600
I'll hate you even more.

690
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,940
But at least I'll respect you.

691
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,560
Because I knew you could bluff better than I could.

692
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,840
Oh!

693
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,420
Oh!

694
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,720
Oh!

695
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,240
Oh!

696
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,800
Oh!

697
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,380
Listen to this.

698
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,080
Listen to this.

699
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
Listen to this.

700
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,820
God has told me...

701
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,500
That...

702
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,140
Now, friends, I'm...

703
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,200
The person you're hearing talking here, I'm Reverend Stang.

704
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
Now, you may say, this man doesn't sound religious.

705
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,500
What kind of a pope or preacher swears and drinks on camera while he's asking for pledges?

706
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,960
I'll tell you what kind, friends.

707
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,640
A subgenius preacher.

708
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,000
A preacher does.

709
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,620
And I want $10,000 pledges.

710
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,280
We are not fooling around here.

711
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,520
Uh, I mean, this...

712
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,540
The transmitter.

713
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,500
These tape decks.

714
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,700
These tapes.

715
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,900
These people.

716
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,260
These things cost.

717
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,580
And so don't call in with these little teeny weeny pledges.

718
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,940
Now, that $10,000 that we've got so far, we know how to spend it.

719
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,540
We'll spend it on fancy clothes and air-conditioned dog houses.

720
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,800
You don't want to see your preacher, Reverend Ivan Stang, preaching in tennis shoes, do you?

721
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,620
You want...

722
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,540
You want to see me in a snakeskin suit?

723
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,740
Because you don't want a stupid preacher.

724
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,160
You don't want a preacher that doesn't abuse your money.

725
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,400
You want one who abuses it, smart enough to abuse it, but honest enough to tell you.

726
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,220
And I need that air-conditioned dog house, my friends, because my own house isn't air-conditioned.

727
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,580
I mean, I'd set up my office in that dog house.

728
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,120
The hour of slack of original tapes wouldn't melt in the heat anymore.

729
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,600
And I'd still share that dog house with my dog.

730
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,920
That's the difference between a subgenius preacher and one of these more famous-like preachers.

731
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,160
The calls are beginning to come in.

732
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,280
But you...

733
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,460
And the children's home in Manila is going to go...

734
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,340
The children's...

735
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,740
The home for slackless children, that thing's going to go down unless we have your money.

736
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,400
So you have been challenged.

737
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,260
You've got to meet this pledge.

738
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,840
And I know that you will, because miracles are happening all over Dallas, friends.

739
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,220
Miracles are happening.

740
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,580
I mean, here's one miracle.

741
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:45,580


742
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,320
I want to reach out especially to the sisters of Connie out there.

743
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,240
It's time that you all got on the stick, you know what I mean?

744
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,600
Yeah, got to have slack.

745
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,080
Yeah, got to have...

746
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,720
Got to have slack, friends.

747
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,780
Yeah.

748
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,020
I got a big old bob.

749
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,700
I got a big old bob.

750
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,800
He's right inside my pocket.

751
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,640
Got my big old bob.

752
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,720
Just reach inside my pocket.

753
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,540
I just washed him off.

754
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,800
He ain't too stinky this time.

755
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,220
You got to try my bob.

756
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,700
He really wants to meet you.

757
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,060
He's not going to be a big old bob.

758
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,460
He's just going to be a little bit squishy.

759
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,040
Hi, this is Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo.

760
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,100
Give every cent you got to KNON at least tithe ten percent.

761
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:08,600
If not, all worldly goods, my friend, could mean your very soul.

762
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Your very soul.

763
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Your very soul.

764
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
He speaks the truth.

765
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
And if you believe that, you'll believe anything.

766
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,640
And that's what we want you to do.

767
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,000
We want you to believe the Bible.

768
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
We want you to believe Marvel Comics.

769
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,460
We want you to believe Pee Wee Harmon.

770
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,360
Cheatness, friends, cheatness counts.

771
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,320
It's the only hope for many of us.

772
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,120
And this footage you're seeing from Slackville's celebration shows the drawing power that Bob can have.

773
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,900
Now, we've got to get that Slack TV network on 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

774
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,540
It's going to be all violence and sex, dear friends, except when we're raising money.

775
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,180
Because we love you and we love your children.

776
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:59,240
And we want to take your children and teach them how to fight the good fight and how to work in our factories and to bring Slack to themselves.

777
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,600
And kids, I want you to go to your parents' purses and wallets right now and pull out whatever you can and send that money to us.

778
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,860
Because it's a miracle.

779
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,140
It's a miracle, friends.

780
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,380
Looky here.

781
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,840
Here's a letter from somebody.

782
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,920
He says, I am a fan and I don't mind if the preacher drinks beer on camera.

783
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,300
When the fundraiser began, I had a hangover and a headache, he says.

784
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,420
But I took Maalox, aspirin, and I watched the pledge drive and slept half a day.

785
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,160
When I woke up, the headache, friends, was gone.

786
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Hallelujah, friends.

787
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,320
The headache was gone.

788
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,560
What more proof do you need?

789
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,560
When others call in and they go, what is this?

790
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,340
What is this thing?

791
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,660
What are you trying to prove?

792
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,020
Is this supposed to be comedy?

793
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,420
Hell, I heard this whole rant in Chicago.

794
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,620
Pope Florist wrote half of this rant.

795
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,000
But, friends, Bob wants, he doesn't just want us to be rich.

796
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,020
He actually wants you to be rich.

797
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,180
But rich without working.

798
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,820
Because this is the church for abnormals.

799
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,580
The church for non-joiners.

800
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,960
So it's hard to get people to join.

801
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,260
Ugh.

802
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,100
It ain't a joke, friends.

803
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,480
Sometimes you're wondering, what is it?

804
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,580
What is this thing?

805
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,160
Well, it ain't collaborative art, no.

806
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,680
It's not subversive either.

807
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,880
And it's not just a bunch of drunk guys.

808
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,800
Nay, nay.

809
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
You'll pay.

810
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
You will pay.

811
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,860
And then, friends, then, at that moment, you will know what you really think.

812
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:33,420
I was born in Dallas in 1952.

813
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,320
The Harvey moved across the street on Bay Street.

814
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,740
And I was born on Oakley Avenue.

815
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:49,200
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

816
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,380
They say he shot the president.

817
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,960
I don't think he did.

818
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,000
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

819
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,340
He used to take me fishing.

820
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,900
All the time.

821
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,500
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

822
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,580
They say he shot the president.

823
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,300
I don't think he did.

824
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,800
Say hallelujah!

825
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,480
Hallelujah!

826
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,880
It's the bright Reverend Dr. Billy Saul Hargis here on behalf of the First Church of the

827
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,800
Holy Land, the Decoe Death and Discount House of Worship, coming to you from Holy Land,

828
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,520
USA, America's first truly religious amusement park.

829
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,280
Not another pilgrim trap, not another religious ripoff.

830
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,080
Yes, we're located right here in Del Rio, Texas.

831
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,100
Friends, you've heard it, it's true.

832
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,860
For a limited time and a limited time only, you may purchase Billy Saul Hargis' Holy Land

833
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:07,420
record package that's right you may now purchase for your very own house

834
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,300
come on jesus come on show yourself

835
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,580
i don't see a single line lighten up friends

836
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,360
okay look last time

837
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,700
last time we we only came in number nine on the pledge drive and that's the truth

838
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:49,640
we bragged too much we had pride but too much pride the giant fell tripped and fell on its

839
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:57,140
clay feet so our one time naked glory has passed we don't expect y'all to support us anymore we'll

840
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,820
probably just fade out and into obscurity eventually here

841
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,440
at the end of the day

842
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:01,440


843
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:01,560
we'll probably just fade out and into obscurity eventually here at the end of the day

844
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,240
It's worse than that.

845
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,100
Bob re-erected again today.

846
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,740
No!

847
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,540
Yes?

848
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,480
It always happens to you.

849
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,040
How come I always miss these things?

850
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,100
He re-erected, and he started channeling through me.

851
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,880
And Bob himself, that's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

852
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,920
for the benefit of those who may have just tuned in,

853
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,280
Bob himself, he told me that if you don't raise $8 million this evening,

854
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,580
he's going to die again.

855
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,420
The listeners to this station are so cold-hearted, so merciless,

856
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,300
so lacking in religious feelings,

857
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,460
they're going to let Bob die a second time?

858
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,020
I certainly hope not.

859
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,520
Hey, Fred, you don't know our listeners, Pope Bob.

860
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,380
I mean, to tell the truth,

861
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
these people would pay to watch Bob thrown to the Christians

862
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,840
while the lions watched in the Coliseum.

863
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,240
Oh, yeah.

864
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,280
They'd just soon see blood.

865
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,280
They want to see blood.

866
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Quit hesitating.

867
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,380
Quit waiting.

868
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
Quit waiting to see how we're doing.

869
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,920
We're doing great, but we still need every penny

870
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,720
because we want to equip this station with those same things.

871
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,560
Tell them.

872
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,340
Tell them what we can do for this station, IDNAX.

873
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,960
Uh, we can add the Nebulon super-powered radars.

874
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,320
That's right.

875
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,880
If with your pledge money, friends, we could equip this station,

876
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,560
and it can go into battle.

877
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,080
It will be able to transform into battle mode in 5.6 seconds.

878
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,680
And it can transform into a battle station.

879
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,540
It has plenty of places to get gas.

880
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,940
And it'll be for free, so you better pledge.

881
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,040
That's right, friends.

882
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,740
That's the thing.

883
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,440
You're getting this.

884
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,680
You've been getting this for free, most of you.

885
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,860
Each pledge drive.

886
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,560
We got 10,000 listeners out there,

887
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,460
and each pledge drive, about 50 people call in.

888
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,700
Last time, only about, oh, 30.

889
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,700
I'm talking in the thousands, of course.

890
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,060
I want you all to get on the stick here,

891
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,800
because otherwise, well, you'll be hearing just more of this.

892
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:56,960
Hey!

893
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,520
And over the airwaves,

894
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,880
the pressure to buy, to give, to pledge was relentless.

895
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,560
And although we've got hundreds and thousands that are so faithful,

896
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,060
and God bless you, God bless you for your faithfulness,

897
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,740
still there are hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands,

898
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,640
who are not faithful, who made the pledge,

899
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,800
and for some reason or another haven't sent it in.

900
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,300
And if we count on that,

901
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,680
and it doesn't come in everything,

902
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,400
everything suffers.

903
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Harsh.

904
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,080
We are even having a hard time meeting the payroll right now,

905
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,660
and the people that we have working for PTL have families, too.

906
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
They have bills, too.

907
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,000
Jim Baker's running costs exceeded $2 million a week.

908
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,040
That's nothing compared to ours, friends.

909
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,540
This baby that I'm holding in my hands

910
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,840
is one of the first babies that has been saved.

911
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
They call it the buckle on the Bible belt.

912
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,180
It has the largest quota of millionaires,

913
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,800
the worst crime rate,

914
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,720
and one of the severest poverty rates in any American city.

915
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,200
Yet Dallas could also be described as the most Christian place on this earth.

916
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,040
This is Pat Paulson.

917
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,900
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election,

918
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,820
and this is the hour of slack on station KNON in Dallas, Texas.

919
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,640
You know, I know where that is.

920
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,420
Hello, Bob.

921
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,940
This is Father Guido Sarducci,

922
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,520
formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

923
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church.

924
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,900
Salute to the Church of the Subgenius.

925
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,940
Carry on.

926
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,480
Well, thanks, Father Guido Sarducci,

927
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,780
but we ain't going to be able to carry on nowhere less than we get some help.

928
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,340
Friends, okay, okay.

929
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,320
It has now become serious.

930
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,680
I will have you paying Tiffany cufflinks.

931
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,000
I'll be...

932
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,520
I'll be...

933
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,020
I'll be seeing you in a minute,

934
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,900
and that you pay up the money,

935
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,300
the money that you have been withholding from Bob.

936
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,460
You have to give unto Bob that which is Bob.

937
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Bob's or Bob.

938
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,140
Money is Bob.

939
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Sex is Bob.

940
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,300
Slack is Bob.

941
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,680
And you, my friend, what you got in your pocket

942
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,340
and behind your pocket, right next to your pocket, up in front.

943
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,560
That is Bob, too.

944
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,660
I want to see some calls coming in.

945
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,120
I was lying earlier.

946
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,460
I'll admit it, I'll admit it, I was lying.

947
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,320
These four mighty reverends are sitting here waiting to take calls,

948
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,400
and nothing's happening.

949
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,780
Dallas is the buckle of the Bible belt.

950
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,840
We're sitting here risking our very lives

951
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,160
trying to unbuckle it

952
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,100
so that their pants may fall down around their ankles

953
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,060
and they may look upon their own private desires

954
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,240
that they would deny otherwise.

955
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,020
And this is the only voice of free speech

956
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,620
and protest and hatefulness

957
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,760
and ranting and slack and bizarreness

958
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,760
in all of Dallas, in all of America, practically.

959
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,220
You know, it's funny.

960
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,780
The Church of the Subgenius does have some historical precedents,

961
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,180
but none of them lasted very long

962
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,560
because they all ran out of money.

963
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,400
They only existed in the first place

964
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
because their members were rich and could get away with it.

965
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,000
Folks, but did you know, this is some research we did,

966
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,340
and of course is working on our new book.

967
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,420
According to this book called The Hippies,

968
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,880
by J.H. Plum,

969
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,060
in Cologne, about 1325 A.D.,

970
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,520
the Brethren of the Free Spirit

971
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,020
met in their luxurious secret chapel.

972
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,280
There, a live Christ celebrated Mass.

973
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,580
A naked preacher exhorted the Brethren

974
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,680
to return to primeval innocence,

975
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,140
to strip, to love.

976
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,720
For those who had become one with God,

977
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,640
there could be no sin, no church,

978
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,800
no property.

979
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,480
Love and the ecstatic experience was all.

980
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,680
The Church of the Pope and the kingdoms of princes were evil.

981
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,980
Take from them all that was needed.

982
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,000
Lie to them, for innocence and love were beyond crime

983
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,520
as well as beyond sin.

984
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,300
The celebrants responded to the preacher

985
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,580
and loved hard there and then.

986
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,940
What better place than a church for copulation

987
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,960
that was beyond sin?

988
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,540
Well, you see, the Brethren,

989
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,420
the Brethren of the Free Spirit,

990
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,040
they tried to be early subgeniuses,

991
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,460
surly upgeniuses back in those days.

992
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,740
And we're trying to do the same thing.

993
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,320
If you would just call the station

994
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,660
and help support us here

995
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,580
at 823-7490 in Dallas.

996
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,060
You know, if you don't,

997
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,660
we're just going to have to do this again next week.

998
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,460
Russia's greatest czar, Peter the Great,

999
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,400
was a classic subgenius

1000
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,500
who slacked out,

1001
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,760
homegrown joke religion,

1002
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,160
presaged dogs.

1003
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,340
When he was only 18,

1004
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,760
the czar and his rowdy pals formed

1005
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,280
the all-joking, all-drunken synod

1006
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,420
of fools and jesters

1007
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,020
as a gigantic satire on the Roman Catholic Church

1008
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,220
as well as the Russian Orthodox patriarchy,

1009
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,120
which was aligned against all of Peter's reforms

1010
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,480
and as an excuse to party like madmen.

1011
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,220
The all-drunken synod had a mock prince-pope,

1012
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,360
elaborate religious titles,

1013
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,800
and their own invented kook Bible.

1014
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,580
They practiced a drunken mass

1015
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,960
and led scandalous processions through the streets

1016
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,340
that vulgarly satirized the orthodoxy.

1017
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,820
Does this start sounding familiar to y'all subgeniuses, friends?

1018
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,140
Their creed was

1019
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,280
that Bacchus be worshipped

1020
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,560
with strong and honorable drinking

1021
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,100
and receive his just dues.

1022
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,280
Their services were riotous displays

1023
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,840
of coarse buffoonery,

1024
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,100
which offended foreign diplomats

1025
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,100
and most Russians.

1026
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,420
Now see, friends,

1027
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,900
anybody else besides the czar himself

1028
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,160
would have had his head launched for all this.

1029
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,420
And everything about the drunken synod

1030
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,100
was almost identical to the church of the subgenius here

1031
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,460
400 years ago,

1032
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,660
except that they had to rely on vodka to get high.

1033
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,220
And another example,

1034
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,420
the ranters in Hampshire in 1649,

1035
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,260
William Franklin and his soulmate and bed companion,

1036
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,920
Mary Gadberry, praise Mary Gadberry,

1037
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,260
found God within themselves,

1038
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,620
gave up work,

1039
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,880
lived in voluntary poverty,

1040
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,600
rejected sin,

1041
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,040
and encouraged their little flock of ranters

1042
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,820
to revel in obscenity,

1043
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,560
promiscuity,

1044
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,540
promiscuity,

1045
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,140
and drink.

1046
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
They were not alone.

1047
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,620
Little bands of these religious hippies

1048
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,340
buzzed like wasp nests

1049
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,920
throughout Cromwell's England.

1050
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,000
Ah, yes, and praise the ranters

1051
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,140
and praise today's modern church of the subgenius

1052
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,120
and all ten of you who have pledged so far

1053
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,780
who seem to give a hoot

1054
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,040
as to what the hell's going on here.

1055
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,660
Don't you want to know about the parties?

1056
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,820
Don't you people want to keep this,

1057
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,440
this show on the air so that you can,

1058
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,000
this church sending stuff out?

1059
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,580
By the way, I will give an address

1060
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,220
where you can write to the church of the subgenius

1061
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,320
for free information.

1062
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
I might as well give that address now.

1063
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,940
Post office box 140-306,

1064
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,640
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1065
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,980
Once again, that's Bob at post office box 140-306.

1066
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,220
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1067
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,280
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1068
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,120
Oh, help me!

1069
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
What do you do?

1070
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,020
What can you do?

1071
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,700
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1072
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,700
What's happening?

1073
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,640
I used to tell myself that.

1074
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,240
I used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.

1075
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,340
But don't you kid yourself.

1076
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,400
Some things happen.

1077
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,300
They haven't to be endured.

1078
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,700
And that's what makes the pleasure so sweet.

1079
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,800
Jesus wept.

1080
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,380
Oh, yes, friends, we do have work to do.

1081
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,580
And I know that you will in the last ten minutes of this pledge drive.

1082
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,720
I know that some of you have just been holding off because you wanted to torture poor old Reverend Stank.

1083
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,400
That's okay, I understand.

1084
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,060
But now it's time.

1085
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,980
It's the last ten minutes, and we have got to destroy the conspiracy in ten minutes.

1086
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,140
Now the wolfman too, the momma and the girl were swimming in the pool.

1087
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,760
We need silver bullets, we need wooden sticks.

1088
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,400
Normal stuff won't stop them cause they live on hate.

1089
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,000
Speak some magic words from a virgin's lips.

1090
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,620
Baby, that'll shake and make them slip and trip.

1091
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,280
There's no turning back, gotta fight the fight.

1092
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,780
Yeah, the monster's gonna jam tonight.

1093
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,200
Monster Squad.

1094
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,240
We're the Monster Squad.

1095
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,720
And the forces of evil better run and hide.

1096
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,440
Monster Squad.

1097
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,500
We're the Monster Squad.

1098
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,240
And the forces of evil best beware of the monster squad.

1099
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,780
Yeah, this is forces beyond the can of mortal man.

1100
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,380
I don't, I don't think, you can't really call up this radio program and say,

1101
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,380


1102
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm gonna try and, try and blasphemy Reverend Ivan Stang.

1103
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,880
Is that what you're doing?

1104
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,200
Oh no, oh no, I'd never do that.

1105
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,160
I like the odds.

1106
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,780
I think we can over show Bob.

1107
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,500
Well, I don't think you understand how lucky Bob is.

1108
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:48,140
I mean, that's like, you just, you can't imagine what kind of forces would be unleashed even

1109
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,320
by the very thought.

1110
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,360
In fact, I would hate to be living on your board.

1111
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,360


1112
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,360


1113
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,360


1114
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,200
I'd rather be on the rock right now.

1115
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:54,840
Oh yeah.

1116
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,660
Like, like tornadoes and stuff like that.

1117
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,940
The worst has been known to happen.

1118
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,880
More like chemical industrials.

1119
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,180
You're talking about overthrowing Bob.

1120
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,600
Here's a guy who's been killed twice and he is so lucky he's been brought back both times.

1121
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,760
Bob has been shot through the head six times and came back fighting.

1122
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm sorry.

1123
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,280
I didn't mean to.

1124
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,260
I'm sorry.

1125
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,440
I'm sorry.

1126
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm sorry.

1127
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:22,760


1128
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:22,780


1129
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,360
I'm sorry.

1130
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,360


1131
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,700
I'm sorry.

1132
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,600
I'm sorry.

1133
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:30,900
This is about your friend.

1134
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,300
Okay, I'm sorry.

1135
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:31,640
We almost finished.

1136
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:39,620
Are we join roasted do not give a damn let his

1137
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,800
time.

1138
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,760
Well,

1139
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,500
We'll be right back.

1140
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:39,500
We'll be right back.

1141
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,320
We'll be right back.

1142
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:23,920
And here we go.

1143
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,960
Can you believe it?

1144
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,640
Wait a minute.

1145
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,200
That's awful.

1146
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,900
Is there nothing I can do to please you people?

1147
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,780
No, I'm sorry.

1148
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,900
Too bad.

1149
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,960
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise.

1150
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,240
As some men count slackness.

1151
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,560
But as long suffering to usward.

1152
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,680
Not willing that any should perish.

1153
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,040
But that all should come to repentance.

1154
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,300
Yes, doctor.

1155
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,940
Here's that repentance now.

1156
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,100
Now wasn't that easy and wasn't that fun?

1157
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,780
But listen to us, the fun's only begun.

1158
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,440
That's not safe.

1159
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,400
All you need is a little more practice.

1160
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,660
Very easy.

1161
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,520
Interesting.

1162
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,520
Very easy.

1163
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,380
Try once more.

1164
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,380
We understand that.

1165
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,120
Sign.

1166
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,180
Are you going to help them?

1167
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:19,740
Sign.

1168
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,540
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four.

1169
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:23,800
Three.

1170
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,960
I can't stand it.

1171
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,340
The pressure.

1172
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,880
We have to talk.

1173
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,360
It's up to you, dad.

1174
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,020
I can't.

1175
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,840
I can't hold them.

1176
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,300
Everything that goes on in the church, Lord.

1177
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,060
I'm right in the middle.

1178
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,920
Well, you know what?

1179
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:46,920
Every time somebody comes by here telling me there's things going on in the church that shouldn't be.

1180
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,800
Well, I'm the first one to jump all over our preacher.

1181
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,080
I tell him just exactly what I say.

1182
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,880
I take an active part in everything.

1183
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,700
David Koresh sounded normal, sounded sincere.

1184
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,720
You just gotta open your mouth and let Bob do the rest.

1185
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,820
You just open your mouth.

1186
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,060
He'll grab hold of your tongue like a snake in a pit of hell.

1187
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,840
He's trying to put it out of its minter.

1188
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,120
He's just let loose.

1189
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,560
Let Bob take hold.

1190
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,000
Bob, grab that tongue and you'll be spewing for Bob.

1191
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,140
You just open your mouth and just let loose.

1192
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,260
Just let loose.

1193
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,360
Just let loose.

1194
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,280
Just let loose.

1195
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,820
Just let loose.

1196
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,320
Just let loose.

1197
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,540
Just let loose.

1198
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,920
They were a dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful.

1199
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,760
Hunk of stinkin' sinful flesh.

1200
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,740
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sin.

1201
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,780
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful.

1202
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,000
Hunk of stinkin' sinful.

1203
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,200
Dirty rotten hunk of.

1204
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,620
They were red as crimson, now they're white as wool.

1205
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,200
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful flesh.

1206
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,700
Oh, now that's hogwash.

1207
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,200
Every person pulled his hair and clawed the ground.

1208
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,120
This is a battlefield, sir.

1209
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,260
This is no recreation room.

1210
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,140
Hey, uh, praise Bob Cutler's and Slack.

1211
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,800
Well, you've got, uh, Reverend Stark, uh, Stang.

1212
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,260
Stang.

1213
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:57,380
Stang.

1214
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,780
Now, this is, this is kind of a sting-stang.

1215
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,140
We're restarting the show now because it's 5 a.m.

1216
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,760
Oh, you're restarting the show?

1217
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,220
Yeah, you kickstarted here on the side.

1218
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:06,900
Show over.

1219
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,480
And what a beautiful world it is, too.

1220
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,060
Yeah.

1221
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,780
Can I ask a special favor?

1222
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,560
I need to remember what radio station we're on.

1223
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,480
Good evening.

1224
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,240
Good evening.

1225
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,720
Good evening.

1226
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:18,720


1227
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:19,800
Good evening.

1228
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:19,900


1229
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:20,140


1230
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:21,840
Good evening.

1231
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,640
Good evening.

1232
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,320
Now, the children, the first rule of the Church of the Subgenius is

1233
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,080
the subgenius must have slack!

1234
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,600
What must he have?

1235
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,040
That's right, children.

1236
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,400
He or she must have slack.

1237
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,740
That's it! That's the great sin!

1238
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,360
That's not it. Well, I know what it was. I know what it was. I know what it was.

1239
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,900
The second rule of the Church of the Sub-Sahedin is that they give no to children. And that is

1240
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,540
that too much is always better than not enough!

1241
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,820
Can I get a too much? What's it always better than?

1242
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,900
Thank you, children.

1243
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,520
It's not me.

1244
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,260
It's not me, Brother Ott!

1245
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,320
It is the sin,

1246
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,320
the idolatrous sin of presumption.

1247
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,500
It's time to stop showing up in church and waiting on

1248
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,660
some preacher to go to the mountain and regurgitate a little bit of spiritual pablum to you.

1249
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,360
It's time to climb the fiery, scaly mountain peaks

1250
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,480
of the pavilions of God and regurgitate a little bit of some new.

1251
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,500
The next rule of the Church of the Sub-Sahedin is that they give no to children.

1252
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,040
The first rule of the Church of the Sub-Genius is so universally violated,

1253
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,520
it is broken so often, so much violated in your face,

1254
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,440
especially in this convention, that you can't believe it's a rule at all.

1255
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,720
But it is, children.

1256
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,400
The third rule of the Church of the Sub-Genius is

1257
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,520
if you don't have a sense of humor, don't try to be funny!

1258
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,860
Commercial break.

1259
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,100
We interrupt this radio for some interference from your VCR.

1260
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,020
We're going to have a little bit of a

1261
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,020


1262
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,460
Close your eyes, but do not believe everything you see!

1263
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,100
It's an hour-long program on the

1264
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,720
Why? Why not?

1265
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,260
What are you doing here?

1266
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,020
I'm enjoying myself.

1267
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,340
What is a reigning beauty?

1268
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,060
A girl who's all wet.

1269
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,800
And it's very confusing, and it's about confusion.

1270
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,800
It pays to be ignorant.

1271
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,260
We can talk about this character thing again.

1272
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,500
All my indicators are wrong.

1273
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,200
All my indicator lights are green.

1274
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,380
Watch what you're doing!

1275
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,900
He saw a flying saucer come down.

1276
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,820
You know, like on the TV.

1277
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,880
Can this be the threshold of inner space?

1278
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,380
Uh-oh.

1279
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,520
It's getting cloudy in the studio here.

1280
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,820
What a big show you have.

1281
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,500
So which side do you butter your dogma on?

1282
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,220
Oh, well, I don't have any.

1283
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,920
You don't? You got a cat mug?

1284
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,660
A man that doesn't have a dogma must have a cat mug.

1285
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,820
No, I have a dogma. I just don't have butter.

1286
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,040
Ah, I see.

1287
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,680
Well, one of those low cholesterol type guys, huh?

1288
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,080
Went on to the demos, and they were gonna be buttering every garage.

1289
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,360
Welcome back to AM Opinions.

1290
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,340
Well, we're still waiting on the final count.

1291
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,900
It's down to half a vote, I think.

1292
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,860
Half a vote lead.

1293
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,300
And later, we're going to learn several recipes for a burn show.

1294
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,800
How to take a burn show and feed the whole family.

1295
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,700
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1296
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,320
Look at this simmering hot cake.

1297
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,080
Looks awful.

1298
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,340
Cheesy, tasty show.

1299
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,460
I want three.

1300
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,100
Chewy, chewy.

1301
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,940
Let's order up a whole round of show. Okay. Everyone.

1302
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,420
Where's that theme music?

1303
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,180
Oh, I feel like shopping. How about you, Bishop?

1304
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,400
I do, too. Let's go on down.

1305
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,040
Let's get the big cart and push on through the show shopping center.

1306
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,640
Look at all these souvenirs from the Puzzling Evidence show.

1307
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:54,740


1308
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,860
Wow, the Puzzling Evidence cooler.

1309
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,580
Look at this. Wow.

1310
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,920
It's got a hole in the bottom.

1311
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,440
Not Puzzling Evidence sun visor. I want one of these.

1312
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,220
All these premiums could be yours if you only call in right now.

1313
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,180
848-442-5.

1314
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,500
848-442-5.

1315
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,960
It's not too late.

1316
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:10,920
430.

1317
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,680
Saturday morning.

1318
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,660
We would encourage all the listeners out there to just dial random phone numbers

1319
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,000
and say that you're calling on behalf of the Puzzling Evidence show,

1320
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,040
KBFA, KBFB, and KFC up in Fresno.

1321
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:22,620
That's right.

1322
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,760
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1323
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,520
St. Stubed will be here in our studio to answer any questions you have.

1324
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,740
Here are some more beautiful premiums here from the Puzzling Evidence show.

1325
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,980
You yourself could have this full set of Puzzling Evidence pencils.

1326
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,860
Over two dozen.

1327
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,340
Multi-colored and good for the whole family.

1328
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,180
How about this?

1329
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:40,660
Yes.

1330
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:45,820
Here in the food center of the show, we have the Puzzling Evidence Portuguese sausage.

1331
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,400
Nine inches feeds the whole family.

1332
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,060
Fully cooked.

1333
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:50,720
Hang up.

1334
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,900
Hang up your show.

1335
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,200
And start again.

1336
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,340
Okay, you're on.

1337
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,620
Do your recipe. No, your recipe.

1338
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,760
Page 41 of the script.

1339
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,660
He's broken the record on that one.

1340
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:04,920
Go ahead.

1341
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,960
No, not right now.

1342
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,380
Wait, wait, wait.

1343
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:07,880
Now.

1344
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:08,860
Breathe.

1345
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,620
Go, go, go.

1346
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,360
Don't hesitate.

1347
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,840
I'm glad I can go on the show.

1348
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,720
You're going to get a hernia doing that.

1349
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,180
Come on, the show on tour now.

1350
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,900
We're in Detroit and we're traipsing through.

1351
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,320
Where are you going in Detroit for slack?

1352
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,580
We're going to wipe the show.

1353
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,940
We do that right at 5 a.m.

1354
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,060
And then you can see for another half hour.

1355
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,040
We got the show bidet first.

1356
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,020
We just strapped the show down.

1357
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,460
No heated water at this hour, KPFA.

1358
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,740
Not until 6 a.m.

1359
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,620
It's only the best for our video.

1360
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,940
The show bidet.

1361
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,540
Yes, you too can be part of these fabulous premiums.

1362
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,320
Available only at your KPFA store.

1363
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,040
Yes, you're asked for the Puzzly Evans show catalog.

1364
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:55,720
Yeah.
