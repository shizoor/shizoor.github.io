Oh, I hate to take you out of that one, but we've got things we have to do and say, dear friends.
This is, number one thing to say, this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Soap Genius.
Hour of Swatch.
The Soap Genius.
Hour of Swatch.
Hour of Swatch.
I get interviewed by people out of town and out of time if they're not out of town.
So we're going to play some old interview tapes and a lot of music, a lot of new Soap Genius music, Bob songs, and you'll find out just what this is all about, won't you?
In the meantime, you can call for information.
Call the Will Adobes.
He's still here at...
Insert local number here.
If you must.
This music in the background is Danny Elfman's score for Beetlejuice.
My favorite movie music composer now, I think.
And now we go from the Supreme Court to a different form of court.
This court you might call the Church of the Subgenius.
You might ask yourself, what do you mean by Church of the Subgenius?
Well, we sent our own Bill Cates out to find out, and this is what he learned.
Okay, we're here with the Reverend Ivan Stang, who is the...
Well, what would you call yourself in relation to this church?
I am the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.
A mere servant of our guru and saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Praise his sweet name.
Now, for those of our listeners not familiar with just who the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs are,
could you briefly give us a capsule description?
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is what you might call a disorganized religion,
or you might say a non-organization for non-joiners, for people who wouldn't be caught dead joining anything.
It is a church, but it's a church for sinners, disbelievers, or people who'll believe anything.
Mutants, misfits, you know, your class clowns, your blasphemers, and talk show hosts.
And who is J.R. Bob Dobbs? He's the guru.
Bob Dobbs is the... technically he's called the high E-pop.
Actually, he's the very salesman of the gods, that man.
If he...

He is indeed a man who has come to keep the conspiracy of the normals from buying your slack away from you.
You see, preachers have to do more than just lay people.
And Bob Dobbs, I think, is here to bring slack to the slackless.
And if you... friends, if you don't know what slack is, then it's probably too late.
You should probably just shut your radio off, because you're gonna find out how much you've been missing.
Okay, what is...
What is slack?
Well, if you have to ask, you'll never know.
As the Hell's Angels once put it, uh,
those who know don't say, and those who say don't know,
which leads me to wonder why they said it, actually.
Uh, slack is, uh, well, to compare it to happiness.
Uh, slack makes happiness feel like having your eyes gouged out with a carrot peeler.
It makes the nirvana of the Buddha feel like being buried up to your...
to your neck.
And, uh, you know, you're just sitting in the sand waiting for the, uh, the ants to come and eat your face away.
Or maybe a lawnmower to come and mow your head off, perhaps.
Sure. Sure.
Hmm.
Yeah, I've got the recipe for a grandma face sandwich if you ever need it.
Uh, what... essentially what we're doing, to get serious here,
uh, what we're essentially doing is we're...
the Church of the Subgenius is trying to tempt sinners away from the devil.
Now, what they do, where they go after that is up to them.
But Bob Dobbs is... is a mighty, mighty man, uh, or... or... or God.
We're not... we're not sure which, and it doesn't really matter.
Uh, and he... he operates out of his skyscraper headquarters in Dallas, Texas, where I work, uh, in the Bible Belt.
And what we're essentially doing through our magazines, our radio shows, the tapes we sell, and our... our new videotape,
um, we're trying to unbuckle the Bible Belt.
And get them to sort of drop their pants and make them face their own... private desires.
So, friends, if you could just open your heart and bend over, because Bob's coming.
He's coming.
And he... and he comes not... he comes not to forgive your sins.
We leave that to better connected deities.
Bob Dobbs comes and comes again and again to justify your sins, my friends.
To excuse your sins.
To offer you that.
To offer you that great excuse that I know you need, my brothers and sisters.
How can you tell?
Oh, there's no way to tell.
Because Bob's coming.
He's sneaking up on you.
Can't you hear him?
Can't you feel him?
One, two, Bob's coming for you.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Bobby's here.
Yeah he's here.
Okay, great.
Thank you, Bob.



I said he's here.
Yeah, Mr.
Cobbs is going to stay all night and I'm going to continue to do a bunch of ...
he's going to DO it.

proper deal with the exes whore then we'll come to meet him and we'll greet him and rule forevermore
bob is my one true savior you can't keep all of the rest looking at his smiling face helps
me when i'm depressed for the pinks i sure feel sorry for tomorrow they'll fry with all the rest
bob has got no real brain to speak of though his luck has seen him through the lack
for all the geniuses led us down the wrong track at least we know a subgenius won't turn around
and stab us in the back the complex they have us suckered but i know that that is a lie
they're due for a big surprise from demons
you
from the sky makes me so glad i wised up got it sized up hell i'm a lucky guy
bob brought me slack and that's lots more than i ever got from the con though i know it's only
because of all those pills he's on heck i know he ain't too clever but whatever he says i'll do or die
you
you
there's a shining golden city where the robots live beneath the central sun's eternal glare
and when the saucers come from space to massacre the human race i know that we'll find peace and
safety there through the holes in the poles we will flee sailing down to the lovely central sea
you
leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free
in atomic powered go-karts we will roam the land while the aliens devour human slaves
they'll squirm beneath the master's boot or roaming packs in search of loot while we will
laugh do you think that we were saved through the holes in the poles we will flee sailing down to the
lovely central sea leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free
we'll ride in flying submarines through air and through the sea while the aliens destroy the works of man
when they leave our blasted world at last we'll rise again without a past to implement our splendid master plan
through the holes in the poles we will flee
we'll be free sailing down to the lovely central sea leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free
oh yes dear friends go ahead try to change channels you can't do it can't be changing channels we were here to insult you








yeah. Onan Canobite in the background says you can't. And those last two songs you heard
were, the first one was by Reverend Orton Nenslow up in Boston. Praise Reverend Nenslow.
No, actually, the first one was by Ahmed Fishmonger. The second one was by Orton Nenslow. The very
last thing you heard was Orton. Ahmed Fishmonger there at the beginning doing,
Bob is my one true savior. And isn't it true? I'm going to go back to,
um, let's see here. This is, um, that radio show was Bleepo Abernathy
pretending he didn't know me doing an interview on K-Rock.
K-R-X-S, I think it is in New York. The biggest station in New York City. How about that, huh?
And this was prime time. This is what, this is how we
take advantage of you, the listener. Thank you. You need my brothers and sisters.
How can you tell, um, if you are a subgenius?
Well, the easiest way to tell is by sending, uh, $20 into the Church of the Subgenius, uh,
sacred postcard.
Oh, that's a good one.
And then you can send it to the post office box for a membership. Uh, the other way to tell would be if you're the kind of person who, uh, hates, uh, most normals. Uh, we're, we're, we're looking for people who love to hate, you might say. Although most of us have to, uh, maintain the illusion that we ourselves are normal.
We're out to teach people how to exploit their abnormality, to quit hiding it, and to, to actually learn how to make money off of it.
Not all of us have to have that.
Now, money is not exactly the same as Slack, but, uh, uh, Slack tends to come a little easier with money.
Now, I, I remember hearing somewhere that the Church of the Subgenius is actually the only church that admits it's in it for the money and, and, uh, in fact pays its taxes without complaining.
Right. We are the world's first industrial church. Bob does not believe that, uh, the public should have to subsidize religions they may not happen to believe in, besides which, uh, doubtful.
seriously if the IRS would ever let us get away with claiming tax-exempt status.
But those things aren't, those worldly things are not important here.
We're discussing the fact that people should get out there
and buy that Simon & Schuster book of the subgenius.
Yes, my friends, the book of the subgenius and its companion volume,
High Weirdness by Mail.
No, you're not supposed to do that.
You can't do that.
Don't go out there and do such a thing.
I'm sorry, we're not supposed to get to that part.
But here's a word from the League of Women Voters of Dallas.
This is a nation of people, by the people and for the people, they say.
So exercise your voting right, November 8th.
Your vote is your voice.
The League of Women Voters says...
Let it be heard on Election Day, November 8th.
Because otherwise, what do you think's going to happen?
They will come in.
They will take over.
And you know who they are, don't you?
They're the ones you don't like.
They're everyone you never cared for in your whole life.
And they'll run this whole country if you don't get out and vote.
I'm not gonna say exactly who they are because...
I think you know.
You know, don't you?
Would you sing the neighbor's song with me now?
Lying in Riceville with a Tommy gun in hand
Shoot the nasty Yankees who have come to take our land
Our costumes facing black up north, it's all the rage
Olive green, dad, wouldn't you make the fashion page?
Yo, heave ho
Yo, heave ho
An evil army of advisors
Late worm got the early risers
They bomb bombs in Agent Orange
I'm just singing in the rain
Fungi sticks and bamboo splinters work much better making things
Give me lots of death and torture, give me lots of gore
We may have lost the battle, but we haven't lost the war
I am not a man of violence
I don't want to use my fists
We can settle this real real peaceful
Don't you think that we should talk and try to work it out?
Cambodian girls are hip, I like their smiling faces
And Leo's girls were oh so sexy, tribute to the races
I'd trade them all today and give up all my money
If I could just be home with my Vietnam money
Odie and his crew took a ram into U and set up ship to go to Hades.
Odie poured a drink offering for all souls and prayed to the empty shells,
of the dead, dead, dead, dead.
Hey there, that's a sporty jacket, where'd you get that tie?
Are those shoes real alligator? Do you like apple pie?
So this is your democracy, it's very very pretty
But I think I'll be going now, back to Saigon City
Where'd you put my brain today? Am I dead or am I gay?
Where'd you put my brain you fool? Am I dead or am I girl?
Lying in a rice field with a Tommy gun in hand
Shoot the nasty Yankees who have come home
To take our land, our costume basic black up north
It's all the rage, while that olive green drab
Wouldn't make the fashion page
Yo, he's ho, yo, he's ho
Animal army of advisors
Lakeworm dropped the early risers
Napalm bombs and Agent Orange, I'm just singing in the rain
Fungi sticks and bamboo splendors, which might better make him faint
So give me lots of death and torture, give me lots of gore
We may have lost the battle, but we have won
We haven't lost the war
V-5-4-4, a bomb for you to go destroy
Be you alive or be you dead, at least you tried to stop the red
Man is for consuming good and taking over the neighborhood
Won't you be my neighbor? Won't you be my neighbor?
Comodian girls are hip, I really like their smiling faces
And Mayos girls are oh so sexy, tribute to the racist
I'd trade them all today and I would give up all my money
If I could just be home now with my Vietnam honey
Where'd you put my brain today? Am I dead or am I gay?
Where'd you put my brain last night? Am I black or am I white?
Won't you be my neighbor? Won't you be my neighbor?
You're hip, so am I, we both eat ham and Swiss on rye
Oh, thanks to Janine, Reverend Janine C for that one there
That was, uh, the neighbor song by the Bloody Mannequin Orchestra
I don't know where she finds these things
Uh, a true subgenius, she really looks around, I suppose
And you can too if you call the station here, please do
Uh, yes, and we're gonna go to another radio interview from the old days
This one had me, Reverend Ivan Stang, and Pastor Buck Naked, the mighty Pastor Buck Naked
The sneaky G. Gordon Gordon
All three of us on Halloween night about three years ago on a show hosted by a lady named Karen Dennard, thank you
We should have slack, that we were born with original slack
But that there is a vast and insidious conspiracy, more insidious than most people ever dream
Trying to sap away our slack
And you know who that conspiracy is?
Oh!
It's them normals
That's right
Mmm
Yeah, it's a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy
There's a, there are heads
It's a go-along conspiracy
But have you ever, do you know J.R. Bob?
Oh
Dobbs?
The day I came to know
Yeah, he helped kill him
Yeah, that's real funny, Buck
That's not exactly true, Buck, it was bad security
What happened?
What happened again?
I don't know, Stang was standing right there and his, his buddies just pow, right in the head
Oh my goodness
J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot a year ago January in San Francisco
Oh
And, and did you read about it in the New York Times?
No
Did you hear about it on all things considered?
Did you hear about it, was it in the Dallas Papers?
No
That proves a conspiracy
It wasn't even a conspiracy
That proves a conspiracy
It wasn't even in the National Enquirer, dear friends, and yeah
Wasn't on Morning Edition either
No, no
No
Bob Dobbs died and life went on, oh yes
The, the people just kept going to work every day, not thinking about what they were doing it for
They don't have slack, they'll
They don't realize what has happened
And it may be, it may be too late for a lot of them
Did he appoint you as his heir for the Church of the Subgenius?
Was he leading the Church of the Subgenius?
Just so I understand what J.R. Bob Dobbs' role was
Bob, Bob leads, Bob leads by, by mistake
He became the leader of this thing by mistake
He doesn't consciously set out to do anything
He's, a lot of us think he's the world's stupidest man
And yet he's so lucky, he
He has attracted all this wealth
Yeah, as Bob
And he sells, he became a salesman
And he just sells by pushing himself, which is the product
In other words, nobody cares the piece of junk they leave with
They only go in for the treatment, which is Bob
I see
Gee Gordon, Gordon
Well, I just wanted to say that a lot of people aren't even aware of the fact that Bob is dead
And it's, it's really weird
It's really presumptuous to speak about an heir to Bob at this particular time
Because Bob will be coming back
Bob will come again
There's just no two ways about it
When, we're not sure
And exactly where he will show up
But there is no heir to the Church
The Reverend Stang was selected by J.R. Dobbs as the sacred scribe
And as the man to stand up and take the heat
When Bob isn't there to answer for any and everything
Now, I, I understand that there are
Are some very illustrious men
And they are members of the Church of the Subgenius
Somebody told me Todd Rundgren
Pee-Wee Herman
No
Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, those people
Pee-Wee is, but not Todd
Those people get our material but they don't send us money
Todd, Todd asked for us to send him a bunch of stuff
And they've never sent his twenty dollar subscription
I called Todd
And he told me he never heard of you guys
You did not
I did so
And he didn't, uh-uh
He didn't say that
Well you call him up and see what he tells you
I, I
Oh, I'm not going to argue over rock stars
Well, Zuta
rock stars. And Karen, you must understand
there are those people who will
even though they have used Dobbs
or they think they've used him at this particular
time of their life, to further their
careers, to further their wealth and their
personal standing, many people
will not admit that
J.R. Bob Dobbs is that one person
that has tilted the luck plane to enable
them to achieve these heights.
You're talking about the normals, of course.
Todd Rundgren may want people to
think he did it by sheer talent.
He may at this point not
want to let on that early
in his career Bob Dobbs sold him
a wooden nickel or something
that somehow tilted
his fate in the
direction it's gone.
But we do have some other people who acknowledge
the existence of Bob. Oh yeah, if you
want us to name drop, we can name drop.
Let's say that
you and your family... Well, this is puzzling
evidence. The host
and the mixer for most of these shows.
Well, in advance of any such
happening, appoint one member
of your family. This schizophrenic show
is for your
benefit, not ours.
Yes,
you are able to hear
such religions as
the subgenius church,
the saint stupid,
the discordians,
all those other
favorites that you ask about,
many of whom appear in the now
modern book
High Times by Weird Male.
And others who have
not yet been added to the
pantheon, and still others who
predate the subgenius by quite a lot.
But in any case,
as we whirl around the planet,
keep in mind
that we love you.
Is this the end?
Is this the end of the show?
Okay, here we go. Almost time for
the news to come in.
Our space cadets have just finished their
space cadets have just begun their role.
They've just begun the bagaing.
I have not yet begun
to fight.
I have never known no man
that has begun so many times
to fight.
They're never fighting.
It's like I've never realized how many times they started fighting.
And then it was over, but no man
can realize the effect of that
same fight upon
the young man.
No man knows how large
these beasts may be.
El Brau.
Is my microphone on?
I don't see any.
No, you're not with us any longer.
El Brau.
Because it's the end of the show.
There's only five minutes left.
Well, why don't we fill it up with merriment and laugh?
Is there just nothing left out there?
El Casa de 8484425.
What is happening on the radio?
There's no sound.
There's no space filling.
Yeah, I don't hear anything, so it makes me kind of wonder.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Makes me scared.
There's a little bit of something.
Makes me scared when I don't have that psychological support.
He hears the music, but not the voices.
Well, put a little, uh, wow in your life and turn it up.
It exists.
And the words are nothing more than...
What's a caller doing at this hour?
Caller, can you hear me?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The adolescent years can be more than just a difficult phase
that a child is going through.
They can be dangerous years when many young people
drink too much, eat poorly, and even consider suicide.
The startling information was compiled
through a study of 11,000 eighth and tenth graders in 1987
from 217 public and private schools.
The study revealed a troubled teenage population
in which 42% of the girls and 25% of the boys
said they had seriously considered suicide.
Surprising numbers said they had smoked marijuana
and even more had five or more drinks on one occasion
in the previous two weeks.
And while most teens understood how AIDS is transmitted,
a majority of those surveyed thought that birth control pills
prevented transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases.
In fact, 2.5 million teens contract STDs each year.
With all this information, the study found that, in the first half of the year,
the most people who were involved in the AIDS study

And this is not surprising that the study found that many teens
either overindulge in fatty foods and sugary snacks
or use unsafe diets such as fasting, diet pills, and laxatives.
All of this together indicates that the problems facing adolescents in America
are just as serious as the problems facing adults,
and there are no easy answers or simple solutions.
I'm Laurie Johnson, and that's 60 Seconds.

They can be used as a cheap source of labor.
They can be taxed, kept in the home as pets.
Or, upon a whim, they might be unleashed and, well, hunted for sport.
Can I get a witness?
You know, I went over to my friend Rick Maverick's house the other day,
and I was feeling kind of down in the dumps.
I was kind of depressed that day.
And he took me out in his backyard,
and he showed me something that just kind of raised my spirits.
And it was just kind of neat that he would do something like that.
It just kind of filled me with a sense of warmth.
Out in his backyard, he had just spelled out,
Have a nice day in the skulls of normals he had decapitated.
And I just said, That's neat.
That's neat.
That's kind of neat.
Now, Mrs. Robinson and I took the local subgenius clinch Sunday school class
on a field trip last Sunday to one of these normal neighborhoods.
And let me tell you, it's every bit as bad as the pamphlet makes it out, okay?
Now, I'm not prejudiced or anything like that.
A lot of my best friends are normals.
I just think as long as they know their place.
Well, they reproduce like animals.
We're thinking.
We're thinking about moving soon.
Maybe even off-planet.
The cattle, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, what is the next theory of the Church of the Subgenius I'm going to discuss tonight?
The next theory is always more hate.
Hater.
I love it.
Don't you?
Don't you?
We're looking for people.
Love to hate, you know.
That was Janer Hypercletes live at the New Orleans World Science Fiction Convention
about a month ago.
Prior to that, you heard a couple of clips from the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley.
Puzzling evidence.
Hal Robbins.
Philo Drummond, in this case.
Mobius Rex.
And Gary, a broke friend.
Oh, yes.
And, uh, well, you know, uh, well, I guess I oughta, I oughta go back to the, to the
talk shows, the talk show radio thing, so that I can then make a smooth transition to
the ironic, um, pardon me, Diet Coke there, the ironic, uh, Eberle Brothers tune, uh,
Jesus in a Red Dress or something like that.
So, here we go.
Oh, son.
Oh, bless you.
What?
And, uh, oh, Mark Mothersbaugh of, uh, Devo, uh, oh.
Devo, okay.
Yeah, we could, we could name some rock stars that are in town right now, but I, we're just
not too sure anymore.
Okay.
Gee, go ahead and go ahead.
It's clear to me, uh, Reverend Stang, you know, when you say Reverend, Reverend Stang,
and when you say Pastor, nay.
Nay, kid.
Uh, that conjures up, you know, we all have, I think, an idea of what that is.
Now, G. Gordon Gordon, you need to, uh, clue me in as to what role you play in the church.
Well, officially, I'm the, I am the mercenary of mercy, and I'm sort of a hit man for Bob.
And, uh, I...
We say this to ensure disbelief.
Yes.
Hmm.
And, uh, we, we don't mind admitting it, because just like the CIA and everything else in the
conspiracy, if you admit it, everybody doesn't believe it and thinks it's a big joke.
But there are certain things...

There are certain things that require work of a quasi-legal nature that, that Bob, Bob
has to have done for him.
As an example?
Well, certain people have to be removed in certain places.
Security has to be maintained in other places.
So...
Computer files have to be emptied.
Sometimes we have to change their minds, so to speak.
So you have your coat on for what reason now?
So you can, so your weapons don't show?
No, actually, it's cold in this studio, so I thought that, uh, normally, yes, normally,
uh, but we...
This being Dallas, uh, people frown on you.
You're carrying guns.
Malaysia, it's no problem.
Unless you're, unless you've got presidents in the, in the, in the sites, then you're
okay.
Then you're okay.
Okay.
Uh, Reverend Naked, uh, Pastor Naked, forgive me.
Um, tell me what you think the appeal of this church is.
I mean, since you say it, it's different from what we know as, as the church.
I think that, just like any cult, when you're starting out, you have to promise something
for free.
You know, free money, free love, you know, something for nothing, and we do that more
than...
I think that's what the cults are right now.
In what way?
Well, you know, just by, just by...
Well, slack, slack is something that's in nothing.
Right.
Just by the, the doctrine of, of, uh, of total slack and, and the, uh, approach to slack,
uh, you know, what is slack?
A lot of, a lot of them ask you, well, it's, it's getting money for not working, and it's...
And where does this money come from?
From Bob.
Ah.
Money from Bob, friends.
Money, oh, the, and someday money will rain from the flying saucers that shall come on
that great day.
X day, July 5th, 1998.
1998.
At 7 a.m., and all the subgeniuses will be ruptured up into the, into the, the pleasure
dimension for eternity, or depending on how much money they've spent on the church.
Uh-huh.
And those who, those who sat around and said, oh, well, I'll...
Take me off to space, take me off to space.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.


Take me off to space, take me off to space.
Take me off to space, take me off to space.
Take me, you saucer man, and take me off to space, and I stop.
Take me off to space, take my little hand, I take my needle in my belly, take a sample
of my skin.
I don't care as long as I can live with a saucer man.
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.
Take me off to space, take me off to space, and take me off to space.


I love you sauce man, and take me off to space.
Come on down you saucer man, and take me off to space.


Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off
to space Take me off to space, take me off to space
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space
Hey cow mutilators, let me join your crew Give me a night, you bet your life I'll cut
up cows for you. I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly
beast without a face. So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off
to space Take me off to space, take me off to space
Come on down you saucer man and to me off to space
Take me off to space
Come down you tiny robots with your little nipper claws
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace
So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space
Take me off to space, take me off to space
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space
Oh, friends, boy, if you only knew what an all-star lineup that was doing that song just then.
That was the song by Orton Neslow, known by other names, which you'll, Katie V, you'll see.
Um, Ahmed Fishmonger.
On, uh, background vocals.
And Donna Cossey.
And Pagan Kennedy.
Oh, yes.
Great subgeniuses up there in shadowed Arkham, Massachusetts.
Ha ha ha, yes, indeedy.
...and said, oh, well, I'll, I'll, I'll buy that one dollar pamphlet about Bob.
Or I'll, I'll have Bob tattooed on my head.
But I'm not gonna send in that twenty dollars for those magazines.
And those people will fry.
They shall fry along with the helpless pinks and mediocritans
who compose most of...
...what they call humanity.
Helpless pinks.
And also, Pastor Nick Head, you were going to, uh, say something?
Well, I'll say goodbye.
Oh.
I'd like to say...
...
...
Mother had on high heels
A red dress for Jesus
Out for a night on the town
Well, she did her best
To outdress the rest
Who found their way downtown
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven
What will Saint Peter say?
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven
God made her that way
Mother had on high heels
A red dress for Jesus
Dressed for a night on the town
...
...

...

God made her that way
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven
What will Saint Peter say?
Oh Lord, let her look that good in heaven
God made her that way
Good evening, brother. Welcome to a late hour program of Country Gospel Music.
My name is Brother John E., and it does me pride to introduce you to the sonic emanations of our little family group,
commonly known, and often confused with lesser musical deities, as the Eberle Brothers.
We'll be hearing several new songs along with our next single.
Yeah, that was the Eberle Brothers from John E. and his crazy brother.
And you'll be hearing more from them.
Next week, Jesus, A Red Dress for Jesus was the name of that song.
A lovely, lovely piece of bulldada there for you.
If you're ignorant and don't know what bulldada means, it's...
Let me get a drink.
Because this definition is long-winded.
Bulldada, the latest exploration into the world of advanced surrealistic,
more realism in which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs,
which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides of the cranium
to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.
Ah, yes, thank you.
Oingo boingo.
If I stuck the
The bad o この


was waiting for beautiful werewolves to carve gives me a rhyming��こう

They're a fun time in the grenades, Christmas Eliebel says cross-otive,
He's the king, I guest, but produces the pardon and ends where Christ played the game!
This circo natural line and he's so beautiful because he was at all you every realarnya intriguing,
so you can understand his partners for when he was at all.

We'll be right back.
I imagine that you're with me on the winning side.
We don't ask too many questions on the winning side.
And I've got this strange sensation on the winning side.
I don't recognize the faces on the winning side.
And we all live here in cages.
Someone cried last night.
And it made a sound.
With my eyes closed tight.
I hear everything.
I can hear your voice.
When I kiss the ground.
When I kiss the ground.
And I'd like to know you better.
And I'd like to know your name.
I couldn't.
Show you something.
If you give me half a chance.
Cause I'm on the winning side.
Yeah!
On the winning side.
Yeah!



Yeah!

Yeah!
In the sleepless night, when the blindness comes
Washing over me like a giant wave
I'm a sandwich meat
Washing over me, I am proud to be
And I'd like to take you somewhere that you've never been before
And I feel so isolated
And I feel so all alone
Here on theakling side
And I feel so all alone
Here on theakling side
And I feel so all alone
Here on theakling side
And I feel so all alone
Here on theakling side
And I feel so all alone

And I feel so on alone




So all alone, yeah, I'm really sorry
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, Mr. City
Mr. City, hey
Well, thanks, thanks
Yeah
Sure is nice to
To be here
In the city
Where the rate of everything is going up
Yeah, especially crime
Yeah, the property taxes
The high-rise buildings
Yeah, but mostly crime
And, yeah
Crime, yeah
Especially crime, that's on the rise
Pretty good
Yeah
But you'll be glad to know
That Mr. City
Is working it out
So that for every crook, there's a cop
That's that boy
You know, of course, where
Crime begins
Why don't you sing about it, son, huh?
Okay, I will
Yeah, thank you
I will
Keep your shirt on
I am
Crime
Yeah
Begins in the heart
Yes
So right
That's right
Yeah, here
Crime is a heart disease
Heart disease
And you can catch it
Yeah
So easy
How do you catch it?
You think you're innocent?
Yup, I'm innocent, your mother
Next thing you know, you're guilty
Oh
Guilty as sin
I am by my brother's keep
Oh, yeah?
And you know where sin begins.
Yeah, well, I was...
Yeah, I caught it from you.
But then...
You caught it from her.
Where did she catch it?
She caught it from him.
From him.
It all happens in gardens.
Oh, by the way, you don't mind if I eat this?
The apple.
Yes, sure is a crime.
I don't have more time.
Apple.
Yeah.
Sure is a crime.
The apple.
We don't have more time.
Sure is a crime.
We're gonna put you away.
Throw away the...
Sure is a crime.
Sure is a crime.
Like I said...
That's it.
And we don't have more time.
Sure is a crime.
We don't have more time.
Yeah.
We don't have more time.
Last time I saw the judge, I asked him what he meant when he'd say judge not.
He got so mad.
The judge did.
Sure is a crime.
He went into solitary.
He had to do it.
We don't have more time.
People in glass houses and all that sort of thing.
It's a crime.
It's a crime.
We don't have more time, friends.
That was Ken Nordean from the tape Triple Talk, which you can get from Snail Records
at 6106 North Kenmore Avenue in Chicago.
60660.
Oh, and this is Mondo Logic.
Fine.

This is the first time I've seen this, but I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not sure what it is.
I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not sure what it is.
I'd like to say something.
Yes, you're good, you're good.
One of the reasons I think that the church is one of the fastest growing cults in the planet,
I would probably estimate, is that every...
Now, you just came from Brazil, did you tell me?
Yes, yes.
And there was the Church of the Subgenius there?
Oh, I am the Pope of Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere.
Okay.
And that we're not putting you on.
Okay.
I mean, none of this, everything we've said so far is true.
Or by what you would call true.
True.
Because the church accommodates anything in a person's belief system into our dogma.
Anything the subgenius spouts becomes instantly part of our church dogma.
You can believe, unlike most religions, you can believe anything you want in this religion.
You can believe in everything.
Okay.
Now, you were making a point.
Well, I think one of the points is that the reason why the Church of the Subgenius is so popular
is because most religions of every persuasion of the...
We call them the false churches.
...require a great deal of hard personal work, concentration, studying, deprivation.
The Church of the Subgenius does not require you to give up anything in your diet.
They do not require you to give up any of those vices that many other religions require you to cease and desist.
We're trying to find new ones.
Now, that's exactly right.
And we know that people don't have time to spend 17 years on a mountaintop meditating.
Is your work the work of the devil?
Let's lay it out right on the table right now in here.
Heck no.
As a matter of...
I wonder about that every now and then, but never for very long, because the devil doesn't operate that way.
We're way too open for the devil.
Basically, the devil has no sense of humor.
You know, if the devil is as tricky as he is...
There you go.
...then, you know, who would he be?
He wouldn't be imitating.
He sure wouldn't be imitating Bob, us.
I mean, what would that get him?
You're gonna find the devil in church!
Mm-hmm.
But not our church.
Okay.
Now, there's...
Now, now, I'm...
...think you saw a monster, but the human mind often plays strange tricks.
Like this one.
I won't do that again.
It's too hard.
Okay, it's too hard, he says.
We're backing down the show...
Hi, it's a rock.
Oh, hey, hey.
Ready to rock, I say?
We gotta do this.
Cat couldn't scratch it.
Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!
Oh, that's good.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Logic control fails humans.
Oh, different failure.
I'm an Eero J.
Successful.
Bada-lada, bada-lada, bada-ling-dong.
Dumb body, Mitch Cambo.
I took Miss Mousey on his knee.
Ring dumb-body, Mitch Cambo.
I pray Miss Mousey won't you marry me.
Ring dumb-body, Mitch Cambo.
Really does.
Bada-lada, bada-lada, bada-ling-dong.
I'm an angel, I'm an angel, I'm an angel.
Okay, well, I just wanted to get shots of you doing the show at some point.
If Dr. Lewis Rex will help us out.
Approaching the surface of the planet now.
Okay, well, I may have lost control of the show for a minute.
I mean, yeah, I'm down for it.
We'll get control of the show back any minute now.
Something ought to be done about these boys.
It's okay, Philo.
They don't take Jesus into their heart.
That's true.
That's ever so true, Phil.
You mustn't be like these wicked men.
Don't do it.
The Bible says that he who broadcasts late at night or early in the morning
shall bring upon his Lord the abomination of desolation.
And Jesus said we should always stick by our God.
And what we think is right, whatever the other fellow says.
That's the truth, friends.
And you can get some more of that abomination and desolation
by writing Bob at Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.
75214.
Once again, free information.
You'll find out.
Just try.
Go ahead.
Try us.
Box 140306, Dallas, 75214.
Just address that to Bob.
And stay tuned for Robert.
Wisdom.
American Music Party.
Friends of audience elimination.
If you leave here alive, if you're good enough to survive the training in Dobstown,
if you can take that fishhook bone member down your throat
and tickle that bat just right, extract it without hurting the bat or yourself.
Then you can sit through a whole set.
Then you will no longer be maggots, you will no longer be pukes, you will be full fledged subgeniuses,
and you will be weapons, weapons for Bob, praying for slack.
Yeah.
Okay, who next?
Any questions?
Any other authors out there?
Disguise.
You never know.
So.
So what the hell?
I own a panel, okay?
So what is, so what is this Mr. Tales of Bob?
Three Fisted Tales.
Well, Three Fisted Tales of Bob, unlike the book of the subgenius, is actually a book of fiction, or partly fiction.
Some of it is fiction.
It's a book of metaphor.
A book of parable.
A book of literature.
Huh?
We thought it was an instruction manual for de-beaking the squid.
You think it's fiction, Doug.
Well, it was originally, friends.
Ah, God.
We'll get back to that next week.
That's a little panel discussion from New Orleans Science Fiction Convention.
See, it's a thing.
With, uh, who's that?
Oh, it's Bob.
Who is on that?
Pope David N. Meyer, Nancy Regalia, John Shirley, Jane or Hypercliques, Brooks Carruthers, Sternodocs
Keckhaver, and Willa Dobbs.
Oh, uh, yeah.
I couldn't see.
There we go.
And I sort of thought I looked.
Wait a minute.
I can't see it.
No, no.
I couldn't see it either.
We have to get it down on the bottom deck so that Robert can take over with his tape.
See, it's okay.
There we go.
There we go.
There we go.
And I sort of thought I looked down and I saw my own body.
We have to put it back together ourselves.
Yeah, might as well.
I do that all the time.
You're removed with the watch.
No, you just look down, you see your arms, your legs, whatever, you know.
I do?
Do you have mirrors on your seat?
Goodbye.
I don't need them.
I can see my own body wherever I am.
It's a power that I've possessed since very, very...
Created.
I simply look down along my own axis and I see all the parts of my body except...
Radio.
Then you can't see the inside of your own eye?
Of course not.
Don't press that button.
Oh, don't use that button.
That's on the show.
Reluctant.
It's only on one side.
Randomize the show.
What about the aerobic report?
Deleted from the subgenius world of physical fitness.
Or one of your speakers.
Or one of your car doors.
Today on...
