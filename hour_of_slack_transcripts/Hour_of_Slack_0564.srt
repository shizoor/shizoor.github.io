1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Test, test, test.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,040
I'm chewing a bit of dead skin from my finger.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,340
Cut my finger right across the callus.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,940
Just chewed off the chunk that had died.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,560
Nice chewy chunk of dead skin.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, better spit out the dead skin.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Here comes the audience.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,620
There's a bunch of them.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,200
Hey, Jimmy, they're here. What do you want?

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,400
Can I get you anything?

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,020
No.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,160
Okay.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,020
Man, check this. What a weird looking bunch.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
I love the subgenius crowd.

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,160
On our way, way to go.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,080
We are so happy, so happy to gaze upon your mutated face.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,560
Thank you very much for coming. Thank you, thank you.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,100
And Jimmy will be supplying our gospel background music tonight.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,120
We have to do a thing that's what's happening today with a lot of people.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,920
It's called the church.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,500
We're gonna be able to have some kind of feeling about this thing.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,000
Of the subgenius.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:17,880
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,140
Power of the subgenius.

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,140


29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,960
Subgenius.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,720
Power of the subgenius.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,040
Subgenius.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,360
Power of the subgenius.

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,460


34
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,460


35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,480
Subgenius.

36
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,820
Subgenius.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,440
And now we'd like to bring to you our one only friendly neighborhood experience maker.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
This is for everybody.

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,180
Thank you, thank you, dear friends.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, I'll be your host, your dear prayer partner on tonight's show.

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,720
And we've got mostly music, sacred music of the subgenius coming up tonight.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,980
Not to the brink, it will be Saturn.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,740
Yes, that's Saturn over there.

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,440
And to your left you will see Bob.

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,740
Bob.

46
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,380
Bob.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Bob.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Bob.

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,080
Bob.

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,880
Bob.

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Bob.

52
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,000
Bob.

53
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,140
Bob.

54
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,420
Bob.

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Bob.

56
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,820
Bob.

57
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,100
Bob.

58
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,560
Bob.

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,600
Bob.

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:12,680
Bob.

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:12,820
Bob.

62
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:21,540
Bob is saying, if we must be cheated and lied to, let us be cheated and lied to for reasons.

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,020
That's a little better.

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Sounds more like.

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,740
I love Slug.

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,140
That's my favorite joke.

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,880
And we can start back.

68
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,780
Praise and Bob.

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,080
I may sound like a Bible beater yelling up a revival in a river crossing camp meeting.

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,260
But that don't change the truth none.

71
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,860
I'm tired of this new age gobbledygook mumbo jumbo replacing Dobbs.

72
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,620
The veiled doctrine of the new age supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm tired of undead preachers preaching undead sermons to undead congregations.

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm tired of ministers who need three church secretaries and a German shepherd and a midget.

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,300
And what all, God only knows what all else for they can get out there and preach the gospel of slack.

76
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,480
I'm tired of preachers saying that God's gonna kill them if they don't raise some money.

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
And then God not following through.

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,780
Bob is being blamed for at least two deaths and 20 injuries.

79
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,420
Not even President Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine was spared Bob's winds and waves.

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,860
One person though died near New York City when Bob threw a tree into a commuter train.

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,920
Bob Bob Bob Bob.

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,320
The way it really is in the air, which you breathe every day.

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,580
Oh yeah.

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,100
Oh yeah.

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,460
Oh yeah.

86
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


87
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


88
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


89
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


90
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


92
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


93
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


94
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


96
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


97
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


98
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,460


99
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh yeah.

100
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,460
Today the league is morning and we have,

101
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


102
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


103
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


104
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


105
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


106
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


107
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


108
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


110
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


111
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


112
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


113
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


114
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


115
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


116
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


117
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


118
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


119
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,460


120
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,680
In part three of the subgenius show, radio ministry hour slack show,

121
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,860
we will present a part three, the sterno expeditions of 91,

122
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,300
the Tevonian victories in the Glen of Roses,

123
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,100
the ball in San Frismo, the capture of Stang,

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,520
his escape and syndication at the Battle of Lili Jing,

125
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,380
the College of Eohippus Revolt, and the ancient spirits of the years,

126
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,600
of the pities, of the spirits sinister and ironic,

127
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,400
the spirit of rumor in battle with the recording angels and the rest.

128
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,060
It's simply a mental performance.

129
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,580
The show is now recorded in a vast domed shaped room,

130
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,120
allowing for application of the Horatian formula et pictura poesis in a spray can motif.

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,600
The figures are created in a rocket away interocitor container MK4

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,640
out on the street and can be transported anywhere through the air.

133
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,100
Listeners are reminded to wear mopper four systems when the show is broadcasting.

134
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,980
Films of safety stand down drills at 0500.

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
No writing.

136
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,780
Says puzzling evidence.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Ah, yes, dear friends.

138
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,940
Music

139
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,880
Music

140
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,920
Music

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,900
Music

142
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,040
Music

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,040


144
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,040


145
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,400
Music

146
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,760
Music

147
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,760


148
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,760


149
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,760


150
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,360
Music

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


152
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


156
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


158
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,940
The Church of the Subgenius, a parody of weird cults, has some 3,000 devoted members

161
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,280
who have bought thousands of pamphlets, stickers, cassettes, and t-shirts, all bearing the trademark

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,360
of Bob's smiling face with a pipe stuck in his mouth.

163
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,900
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

164
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,720
No?

165
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,740
Good.

166
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,700
The fact is, it's too late.

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,420
Everybody says I'm paranoid.

168
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,600
They all think I'm crazy.

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,060
They all smile to my face.

170
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,940
But they'd like to see me die.

171
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,280
And to attain this lack of Bob, a subgenius must fight a vast and powerful conspiracy,

172
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,400
what Pope Meyer calls the Pinks.

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,220
The Pink is sort of that ruddy glow in the cheeks you see on people who want to sell

174
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,580
you something you don't really need, who want to take away that which means the most to

175
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,620
you and give it back to you for a profit.

176
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,800
Oh, the system sucks you dry.

177
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,340
But the system is too lazy to do that.

178
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,340


179
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,340


180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,940
And the system is too lame to manage even that.

181
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,820
I mean, the system can't even lick properly.

182
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,480
I submerge from time to time.

183
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
And I bob up to the surface.

184
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,160
I quit my job.

185
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,800
And I still got all this juice.

186
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,020
I mean, nobody's even bothered to try to suck me dry.

187
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,160
How has your life changed since Dobbs came into your life?

188
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,420
I realized that the exes are a reality and that my life is geared towards their arrival.

189
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,060
I redefined my own space and was able to center my being.

190
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,900
When I first heard Bob on the radio, he said that he could heal and told me to put my hand

191
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,160
on the radio so that the Bob energy could come out through the airwaves.

192
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,620
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation, the church of the subgenius.

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,020
If you plan to get saved, you had better do it now.

194
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,400
There will be a day not in the too far distance.

195
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,160
The future in which Antichrist will be revealed and the mark of the beast will be introduced.

196
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm going to point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government that

197
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
the conspiracy is trying to get across on us.

198
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,380
And we suspect that the only way to get across on us is to get the truth out of the world.

199
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,380


200
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,620
The only thing that can fight a one world government is going to be a one world religion.

201
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,420
And of course that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,320
When he says you shall have tribulation ten days, he means you're going to have a maximum of trouble.

203
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,900
And that's just the way things are. The church is not at home in the world.

204
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
No, no, don't touch me.

205
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,540
Don't think I'm not going to tell him about men. What terrible things men do.

206
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,980
When he grows up, he's not going to manhandle any poor little girls.

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,540
He's going to turn those old men into nuns.

208
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,640
Now this is a crooked and perverse nation.

209
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,420
We have millions and multiplied millions of crooked politicians.

210
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,440
God put a death penalty upon adultery.

211
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,280
When we see millions and multiplied millions of people spending hours and hours before the television,

212
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,300
learn how to crack safes, rob banks, kill policemen, get divorced, and break up homes.

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,000
All these soap operas, hour after hour, warps people's minds.

214
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,680
That shows that they're crooked. That shows they're perverse.

215
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,100
That shows that they're stupid. That shows they've got warped minds.

216
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,280
It's the human condition. It's things falling apart.

217
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,260
It's fat ladies in double knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

218
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,260


219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,240
Search in their head for their purposes.

220
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,240


221
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,080
It's your house, it's your house, your house, your house

222
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Burn it down

223
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

224
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,320
There's so much paper

225
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,040
Burn it down

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,280
The kindling's there, the fuel for the fire

227
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,100
It'll glow, burn, beautiful orange-licking flames

228
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,320
Paper, paper, paper, paper

229
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,500
It's all just fuel for the fire, the big bonfire

230
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,920
Violence against buildings, violence against property

231
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
The ultimate act of rebellion

232
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,680
And I'm gonna build me a guillotine

233
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,740
Grab these suits by the hair, drag them by their power nooses

234
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,400
And chop their lousy heads off, it's French Revolution time

235
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,460
Burn it down, and there will be a huge famous painting

236
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,380
Fight messenger leading the people, yeah

237
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,120
Forty-three years she said

238
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,340
Forty-three years she was chained to a desk

239
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,460
Forty-three years she pushed around paperclips and rubber bands and Sirac memos

240
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,640
Forty-three years and she hated every damn minute of it

241
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,040
Now she drinks her cheap bars

242
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,320
Now she waits for her landlord to sell her building so he can toss her on the street

243
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Forty-three years of all that paper, paper, pushing, pushing paper

244
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,940
Of being an appliance, part of the hardware, the interior decorating

245
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,720
Forty-three years of being no one for a paycheck

246
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,020
Now she's a real asset

247
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,560
All these buildings, all the skyscrapers

248
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,760
All that chrome and glass filled with all that paper

249
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,400
Well we could have ourselves one hella Molotov cocktail

250
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,680
All we need is a little gasoline and just one match

251
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,520
Light to match

252
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,840
All these people in their starched white shirts

253
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,160
Who act like they own the streets and the sidewalk and the world

254
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
Because they do

255
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,320
Burn it down

256
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,860
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

257
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,620
All these damn pets, these damn clocks, these damn termites, damn ants

258
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,680
All these drones in my way

259
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,660
I am lost in the forgotten guts of dead office equipment souls

260
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,880
Jesus came to the marketplace

261
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,540
Jesus came to Market Street and he said burn it down

262
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,680
All you buyers and sellers, he said burn it down

263
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,480
You pervert!

264
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,040
You pay no price

265
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,040


266
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,840
Wanna eros and defame my world

267
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I am riding my bicycle through the den of lepers

268
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,480
and I am trying to remain unscathed

269
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
But me?

270
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,440
Well I'm just a white, slime maggot

271
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,740
I was fed television and Twinkies and the scroungy ethics of children of the Depression

272
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,200
One who can't throw away a piece of wilted lettuce

273
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,080
And one who buys crates of the finest just to watch it rot

274
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,060
We are the refuse of decaying systems

275
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,600
We are products of decay

276
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,380
But oh, the fragrance with the beauty of death

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,700
The rollicking waltz we danced

278
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,060
Oh come on, come on, come on

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,940
Light the match

280
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,500
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

281
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,460
I am man, sometimes I cry

282
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,240
I am man, sometimes I laugh

283
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,420
Sometimes I sigh

284
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,940
I am man, sometimes I wonder aloud

285
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,860
Sometimes I goof on clouds

286
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,640
And sometimes I goof on clouds of pillow soft with you

287
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,020
And sometimes I wave at people I don't know

288
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,920
And sometimes I wave at school buses

289
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,460
All full of eager fresh faces

290
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,060
But what's the point of me?

291
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,720
My, my, why, why is the sky blue?

292
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,560
Days are gone, I'm a man now

293
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,800
Instead of waving at the bus I, I throw rocks

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,380
Hoping I shatter a window or two

295
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,980
Causing splintered broken glass to explode

296
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,700
Into the terrified frightened children's faces

297
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,220
I'm a man now, causing horrible painful lacerations

298
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm a man, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes I hate

299
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,180
And sometimes I, I hate and hate and hate

300
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,440
And, and sometimes I, I am a man

301
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,260
And sometimes I hate

302
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,060
And sometimes I, I am a man

303
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,820
And sometimes I'm hate

304
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,600
And sometimes I'm a man

305
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
I am hate

306
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,060
If I were a man, I'd have permission

307
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,560
To sleep in a doorway

308
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,700
Look like shit in the morning

309
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,860
And have a beer for breakfast

310
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,260
I'd be allowed to wear the same clothes

311
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,800
For days on end

312
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,960
Smell human

313
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
Have an opinion

314
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,860
Ride the highway without destination

315
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,520
Get off my roller skates and buy myself a car

316
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,600
I'd make a huge mess

317
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,620
And lots of noise

318
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,400
I'd take things apart

319
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
And leave them undone

320
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,040
I'd be a desperado

321
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,980
Not just desperate

322
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,780
Oh, oh, oh

323
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
And tired

324
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,900
My large fragile ego would cater my attention

325
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,700
I'd tell my gory tales of battle

326
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,420
Display my scars promptly

327
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,600
And never be seen or heard from again

328
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,400
If I were a man

329
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,160
If I were a man

330
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,520
If I were a man

331
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,040
If I were a man

332
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,440
If I were a man

333
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,120
If I were a man

334
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,120


335
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,260
Love will change the world

336
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,800
That's what we were told in the 60s

337
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,660
Love will make you happy

338
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,160
Love one another

339
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,040
Love makes the world go round

340
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,420
All you need is love

341
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,480
We've talked of love non-stop for the last few decades

342
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,260
Actually for the last few thousand years

343
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,960
Where exactly has it gotten us?

344
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,120
Are we one step closer to paradise?

345
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,640
Hardly

346
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,000
Love hasn't stopped war

347
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Cured crime

348
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,940
Erased poverty

349
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,080
Hasn't even come close

350
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,600
Look for any sign of improvement

351
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,440
And I guarantee you

352
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,820
You'll see only the most cosmetic of changes

353
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,540
Window dressing

354
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Empty symbolism

355
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,040
Bachelors fall to raw

356
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,580
But things are getting better all the time

357
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,840
The Lodnitz assure us

358
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
What about peace in the mid-east?

359
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,740
What about harmony in South Africa?

360
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,900
Sure

361
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,600
There's peace in the mid-east

362
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,340
In between bombings

363
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,040
And there's plenty of harmony in South Africa

364
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,640
If you're wealthy enough to live behind electrified fences

365
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,020
And locked gates

366
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
In reality

367
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,340
Things have turned to sh**

368
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,120
Social and moral decay is like an out of control cancer

369
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,280
That's taken charge

370
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,320
Cancer born of love

371
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
If some people are actually stupid enough

372
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
To believe things are improving

373
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,600
It's only because their poor brains are so been owned by love

374
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,960
That they can no longer think straight

375
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,360
Love

376
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,040
Sickly love

377
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,380
Brotherly love

378
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,880
Unconditional love

379
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,420
Cowardly love

380
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,360
Geek love

381
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,820
A love that says relinquish judgement

382
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,860
A love that encourages acceptance

383
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,220
At the expense of discernment

384
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,000
It's no wonder people imagine things have changed for the better

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,020
When in fact all this change

386
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,520
Is their capacity to accept any amount of sh**

387
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,080
Unconditionally

388
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,440
So the verdict on love is both bad and good

389
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,400
The bad news is

390
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,180
That love has turned the world into a sewer

391
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,380
The good news is

392
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,460
People have learned to love with knowledge

393
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,900
The good news is

394
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:44,900


395
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,380
The good news is

396
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:51,880
People have learned to love with knowledge

397
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,580
You say well Dawson, is there love at first sight?

398
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,360
Well, not really

399
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
Let me explain that

400
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,440
Let's say you want to grow the world's greatest plant

401
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,800
I don't know why, but let's just say you did

402
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,220
So you got the world's greatest seed

403
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,760
And the world's greatest sunlight

404
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,900
There's only one by the way that I know of

405
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,380
The world's greatest fertilizer

406
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,400
We get all of that together

407
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,700
And the world's greatest seed

408
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,760
We get all of that together

409
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,280
Would we have a plant?

410
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,400
No, what's missing?

411
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,040
Time

412
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,160
What do we have?

413
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,540
Good chemistry for a good plant

414
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,520
What's missing?

415
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,080
Time

416
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,380
You say Dawson, I meet some guy or some girl

417
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,440
I've met some guy or some girl

418
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,760
And there was just this attraction

419
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,360
And I said I am in love

420
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,380
No, that was not love

421
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,580
That was chemistry

422
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,800
Good chemistry

423
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,280
What's missing?

424
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,100
Time

425
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,020
You are in love or you think you are in love

426
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,860
Or you know somebody who thinks they might be in love

427
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,520
Your greatest friend is what?

428
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:45,880
Time

429
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,800
Why?

430
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,320
Remember, love is a growing process

431
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,300
Any amount of growth takes time

432
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,140
If you're not sure, don't

433
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,740
If you're still not sure, wait some more

434
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,060
Why?

435
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,600
Time

436
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
You say time for what?

437
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
What am I waiting on?

438
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
Time to find out what the other person is really like

439
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,000
Now you can't get 100%

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,780
But like I said, you can come closer than most people

441
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,180
You want to ask some real hard questions

442
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,620
One of the first ones you want to ask is this

443
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,200
What happens when this person is disappointed?

444
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,280
You know why?

445
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,240
Give your marriage about 36 hours and I guarantee you'll disappoint them

446
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,040
What is this person like when you're cross?

447
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,340
Why?

448
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,740
Give yourself 48 hours and you're gonna cross

449
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,120
Is this person neat or is this person slut?

450
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
That may not seem much to you but if you're really a neat person

451
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,020
And you're a partner

452
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,940
He wants me to hug him

453
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,460
He wants me to feed him

454
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,660
That's gonna cause all kinds of stress

455
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,780
Including if your partner's mother has to go into the bedroom with a hand grenade and a blow torch

456
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,900
And when the hand grenade goes off, the room's in better shape than before it went off

457
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,280
And your partner says you're trying to prove evolution to see if chaos can form order

458
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,080
You're going to have some problems

459
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,700
Here's one that we always talk about

460
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,340
Ready for this?

461
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,580
Ladies, you want to know how your husband's going to treat you?

462
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,500
Your future husband?

463
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,240
Watch this

464
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,920
Watch how he treats his mother

465
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,220
That's right

466
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,120
Once a marriage settles down to a fireside gas

467
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,520
He'll pretty much treat you the way he treated his mother

468
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,060
Why?

469
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,980
We're all creatures of habit

470
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,460
Guys, do not

471
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,980
I repeat

472
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,320
Do not marry a woman who is hostile to her father and has not worked it through

473
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,540
Do not under any circumstances marry a girl who is hostile towards her father and has not worked it through and gotten healed

474
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,180
Why?

475
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,920
Because that's the way she's going to treat you once the marriage settles down to a fireside gas

476
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,480
She

477
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,720
You want to stop f***ing me

478
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,660
No, Kim

479
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,640
Think about God

480
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,140
She pisses my pussy

481
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,620
Oh, we've talked about this, but let's talk about it again

482
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:52,940
Pussy

483
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,260
Remember the deepest desires you have outside of being loved is what?

484
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,820
God

485
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,320
So don't get this vague talk about God

486
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
What does this person really stand with Jesus Christ?

487
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,160
I would say the one who's the most powerful person in the world is God

488
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,820
And one of the biggest complaints of Christian married women across the country is that their husbands do not lead them spiritually

489
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,540
Watch this one

490
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,380
Is this woman or this person romantically mysteriously quiet?

491
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,900
A person who is romantically mysteriously quiet in dating may end up a bore in marriage

492
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,820
Same person

493
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,440
She's a pussy

494
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm a pussy

495
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,260
She's a pussy

496
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,260


497
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,260


498
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
She's a pussy

499
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,700
She is a pussy

500
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,960
She pisses my pussy

501
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
He once ridges my pet fur pussy

502
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,320
She does this all the time

503
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
I offer you more than your wildest dreams have ever imagined

504
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
You'll become the mother of a new race of gods

505
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,880
You'll inspire the universe

506
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,780
I could sweep you out of existence with the wave of my hand and bring you back again

507
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,700
I can give life or death

508
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,640
What else does mankind demand of its gods?

509
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,040
Mankind has no need for gods

510
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,700
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pink,

511
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,120
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

512
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,540
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

513
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,840
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

514
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,120
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

515
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,880
And so the Church of the Subgenius offers hope to a disbelieving world.

516
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,040
There's a lot to laugh about here,

517
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,900
but Reverend Ivan Stang says the subgenius message is not to be taken lightly.

518
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,600
Cultivate evil for the sake of evil, nothing else.

519
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,540
They express themselves in darkness, for darkness without leavening motive.

520
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,960
Now this ardent purity allows them to access a secret place

521
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,420
where the cultivation of evil proceeds in exponential fashion,

522
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,220
and with it the furtherance of evil's resulting power.

523
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,580
This place of power is tangible, and as such it can be found, entered,

524
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,060
and perhaps utilized in some fashion.

525
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,300
You don't believe me? You think I'm mad? Overworked?

526
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,720
Go away.

527
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm just kind of worried about Dallas.

528
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,960
It was the so-called hotbed of birchism.

529
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,580
And it just seemed if there was any place in Texas where we'd have trouble,

530
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,620
we would have trouble there.

531
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,520
They say the cult may look weird and shocking today,

532
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,020
but a year from now,

533
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,020
when the presidential jury is going to be in Texas,

534
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,000
the political campaign heats up,

535
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,080
and people see the choices they're truly confronted with,

536
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,600
they will run to Bob with open arms as the only sane alternative.

537
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,800
Upcoming revival meetings will be held in Chicago,

538
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,780
Austin, Texas, Baltimore, and Minneapolis.

539
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
Oh, and there's one of those upcoming revival meetings

540
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,980
heard in the background right now.

541
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,300
Ooh, it's like a messy one.

542
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Welcome to Celebration Florida.

543
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,200
Non-Caucasians, please head to the left door to sign your mortgage.

544
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,040
Thanks very much.

545
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,180
Open bar. Open now.

546
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,100
Here come the tanks, ladies and gentlemen.

547
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,660
Rolling down Main Street right now.

548
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,420
Thanks for the memories.

549
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,280
Here comes the smiling crowd.

550
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,740

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:28,100
That piece there, celebration, and the upcoming ultimate solution, the bathtub samba,

580
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,200
are by Reagan Spollett.

581

by Reagan's Pollock

583
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,480
I could

584
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
spend the rest of the show just

585
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,500
playing Reagan's Pollock although

586
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,240
I'll have to cut some bad

587
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,560

588
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,340

I am splashing around in all this nice hot water.

655
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,200

Here I am down in the bathtub.

I am splashing around in all this nice hot water.

663
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:17,200
Long ago I used to think of this dead butcher.

664
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
And this feeling like blood.

665
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,240

00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,400
Sunk in a big pit.

00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,680
Ah, ah, pussy.

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,320
Seems so bad that I can't bear it.

683
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,100
Splashing around in the tub.

684
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,600
Splashing around in the tub.

685
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
Splashing around in the tub.

686
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,740
Having so much fun.

687
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,560

Oh, my God.

704
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:31,380
Oh, my God.

705
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,460
The face of my vipro is a metal mask like the acid line

706
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:45,160
Face of Lana, turn of her ring down like the heart of the machine

707
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,240
Rushing my fragile skull

708
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,260

And the cry of exorcistic rage

719
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,820
Escapes my lips as I develop

720
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,100
Revolutionary consciousness

00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:39,140
I never thought you'd be drinking You and Harry and Timmy and Toby and Jim

740
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,020
You want me to wear a diaper

741
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,180
You want me to wear a diaper You want me to wear a diaper

742
00:43:50,200 --> 00:44:06,280
A diaper is for a little man or girl A diaper is to make poop easy, not for me

743
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:17,520
You want me to wear one and nothing else

744
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:42,180
You want me to wear a diaper You want me to stay in the closet of the hotel

745
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,500
You want me to wear a diaper You want me to stay in the closet of the hotel

746
00:44:47,520 --> 00:45:00,120
You want me to wear a diaper

747
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,620
A diaper is to make poop easy, not for me

748
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:04,620


749
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:04,620


750
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:04,620


751
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,820
Make poop all over the simpler shit

752
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,960
Cards can't be my diaper

753
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,300
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrr

754
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:16,520
Singer

755
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:24,360
You're putting the goggles on me

756
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,340
Now I can't see

757
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,020
I can feel my ears

758
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:47,500
I can't feel my ears

759
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:56,240
I can't feel my ears

760
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,080
You want me to wear a diaper

761
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:09,260
You want me to show you my nipples

762
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:17,000
You and Harry and Timmy and Toby and Jim

763
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,480
You and Harry and Timmy and Toby and Jim

764
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,680
The diaper is soggy

765
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,400
The diaper is snug

766
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,840
The room is too cold

767
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,800
And the night is too bright

768
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,180
My boogies are hard

769
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,160
I peed on the floor

770
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,400
A thread hooked the room

771
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,100
With the orange shed

772
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,020
I picked a tree

773
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,240
And the others

774
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,460
Put me down

775
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,100
My necks grew dark

776
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,200
My tie is skewed

777
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,660
But I can't die

778
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,280
Can't tie me to thecourse

779
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,160
Can't die

780
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,860
You buy me nothing

781
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,080
Or say I was

782
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,080


783
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,080


784
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,700
To the grocery store

785
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,780
Here is a appreciate

786
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,460
Just LORD!

787
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,220
Dieper!

788
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,360
Dieper!

789
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,560
Dieper!

790
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,800
Dieper!

791
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,820
Dieper!

792
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:43,160
Yes friends, creepy isn't it? It's got to be one of the creepiest scariest CDs I...

793
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,000
Dieper! Dieper!

794
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,660
Yeah, this is... all that I've been playing for the last 15 minutes is a band called Reagan's Poly.

795
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:07,060
Dieper! Dieper! Dieper! Dieper! Dieper!

796
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,240
Reagan's Polyp, dear friends, I'm about to give their address. That's from a CD, a mystery CD.

797
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:32,440
My friend, Pope Sternodox, the Pope of all Arkansas, who was one of the founding members of the great subgenius band Doctors for Bob,

798
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:43,060
has been telling me about, and sending me tapes from, this band that he is in sometimes, with a fellow named Chris Dumas, called Reagan's Poly.

799
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,120
Reagan's Poly.

800
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,680
I've played a little bit of Reagan's Poly before, but then suddenly out of the blue came this CD of said band.

801
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,820
Doesn't have Sternodox's name, doesn't have anybody's name on it.

802
00:48:52,900 --> 00:49:01,160
And it was Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project who sent it to me, and I could swear I hear Joe Newman's voice in this thing.

803
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:11,260
Anyway, that's just a tiny sampling of the sickness, and I'm sorry I had to probably remove some bad language,

804
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,140
but the incredible sickness of Reagan's Poly.

805
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:19,440
Here's the address to write to for information about self-send same band.

806
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,460
Trash Fish Entertainment Company.

807
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,180
For information on Reagan's Polyp.

808
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:36,140
Trash Fish at 225 West 105th Street.

809
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,380
That's 225 West 105th Street.

810
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,140
Suite 106.

811
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,060
Suite 1FW.

812
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,420
Suite 1FW.

813
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,240
New York, New York.

814
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,120
1 00 25.

815
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,960
And, while I'm doing addresses, I should give the address of Huge Voodoo.

816
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,400
You could write for Huge Voodoo Tapes.

817
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,160
From 10 Waverly Place, number 2.

818
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,380
Madison, New Jersey.

819
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,740
That's 10 Waverly Place.

820
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,520
Number 2.

821
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,220
Madison, New Jersey.

822
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,620
07940.

823
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,280
That's 07940.

824
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,140
Notice how I clearly and concisely give these phone numbers so unnoticed.

825
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,160
And, like the people who call the Subgenius Information Hotlines and leave their numbers,

826
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,680
who talk about like this up until they leave their number when they go,

827
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,260
200 February.

828
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,520
Thank you.

829
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,240
Call me back.

830
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,300
But, friends, you can call the Church of the Subgenius if you want to place an order toll-free.

831
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:09,560
1-888-669-2323.

832
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,920
Sounds like a joke?

833
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,020
Isn't a joke.

834
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,840
It's for real.

835
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,760
Get to it.

836
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,980
And write to Bob.

837
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,620
Send him your address so we can send you the free information.

838
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,880
The pamphlets, the books.

839
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,480
Well, the free information anyway.

840
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,800
Write to Bob.

841
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,400
Do it, man.

842
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,120
Get right with Bob.

843
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,460
That's Post Office Box.

844
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,340
I'm going to give you that number.

845
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,240
Post Office Box.

846
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,160
140306.

847
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,240
Got that 140306.

848
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,720
Dallas, Texas.

849
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,540
That's Dallas, Texas.

850
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:39,800
Texas.

851
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,260
75214.

852
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,880
Got that?

853
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,860
Box 14306, 75214.

854
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,580
Get right with Bob.

855
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,540
This is Jehovah Hates Fred.

856
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,380
Hello, who is it?

857
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,880
Hello, Burbank.

858
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,180
Hello, who is it?

859
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,240
Hello, boss.

860
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,240
Hello, I am Herve Vichet.

861
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm a little midget and I'm going far away.

862
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,460
I jumped off a cliff and killed myself.

863
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,300
No, actually, I jumped off the bottom shelf.

864
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,440
I'm dead.

865
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,500
Dead little midget.

866
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,900
Nobody loves me.

867
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,560
Not even Ricardo.

868
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,600
And I always said, they playing for him.

869
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,800
I looked out for the plane.

870
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,520
But they never really played.

871
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,240
They never really respected me.

872
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,660
But I'm just a little French midget.

873
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:45,740
Hey, boss.

874
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,420
Why don't you love me?

875
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,940
Why don't you like me?

876
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,100
I just want to be loved.

877
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,300
Boss.

878
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,840
I've traveled the world and I've seen the sights.

879
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,360
But now I'm dead.

880
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,560
I lay on my back at nights.

881
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,480
I am dead then.

882
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,680
A decomposing little midget.

883
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,440
I can't see the plane no more.

884
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,100
I can't dress in white.

885
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,440
Because I'm laying under the ground day and night.

886
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,820
Nobody loves me.

887
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,560
I'm a dead midget.

888
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,680
I'm a dead midget.

889
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,440
Hey, boss.

890
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,680
Boss.

891
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,260
No guests are coming anymore.

892
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,120
Hey, boss.

893
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:48,960
Hey, boss.

894
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,580
I was dumped by a six-foot whore.

895
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,300
Nobody likes me.

896
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,940
I could count all the people who hated me and my stubby little fingers.

897
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,660
Nobody likes me.

898
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


899
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


900
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


901
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


902
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


903
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


904
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


905
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


906
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


907
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


908
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


909
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


910
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


911
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


912
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


913
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


914
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


915
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


916
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


917
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


918
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,660


919
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,720
I'm just a French midget.

920
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,340
I tried to sell donuts to make ends meet.

921
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,840
But all anyone wanted to do is greet me and say, the plane.

922
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,980
The plane.

923
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,660
Oh, the plane.

924
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,700
The plane.

925
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,160
The plane.

926
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,560
Oh, the plane.

927
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,020
The plane.

928
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,780
Even the guitarist won't respect me anymore.

929
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,320
He keeps playing the same chord over and over again because I'm a French midget.

930
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,800
Oh, no.

931
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,700
Depend.

932
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:58,820
Depend.

933
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,780
Depend.

934
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,640
Oh, no.

935
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:04,820
Depend.

936
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,640
Depend.

937
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,640
Depend.

938
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,460
Hey, boss.

939
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,660
Depend.

940
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:08,660


941
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:08,660


942
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:08,660


943
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,720
Depend.

944
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,360
The pain.

945
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:10,600
Depend.

946
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,020
Yes, tattoo.

947
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,740
It is your pain.

948
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,740
Hello, boss.

949
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,860
Goodbye, boss.

950
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,100
I'm dead.

951
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, how touching.

952
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:29,480
Dear friend, what a touching, touching song about a dead, dead midget.

953
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,440
That's a Herve Villaché by Jehovah Hates Fred that's wonderful.

954
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,640
It's a classic.

955
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:38,640


956
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:38,640


957
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:38,640


958
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:38,640


959
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,600
band with St. Andrew and Pope Fred

960
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,680
on vocals there, I believe. And here's

961
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,380
the address for Jehovah Hates Fred

962
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,940
and also the wonderful

963
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,000
Ogre Network subgenius.

964
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,560
What happened to my

965
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,820
volume test?

966
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,700
What the hell?

967
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,420
Okay, here's the

968
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:56,780
address.

969
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,440
Post office box

970
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,220
53

971
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,180
Plainfield, Illinois.

972
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,640
That's for Jehovah Hates Fred.

973
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,080
PO box 53

974
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,660
Plainfield

975
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,220
Not playing

976
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,260
field, but plainfield.

977
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,740
Just plain, plainfield.

978
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,060
L-I-L

979
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,400
6-0

980
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,700
5

981
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:22,880
4

982
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,480
4. 6-0-5-4-4

983
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:27,760
Okay?

984
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,020
Jesus loves you.

985
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,520
There's a young lady that's been listening.

986
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,300
She's on hold right now. Her name is Zena from

987
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,220
New York. She's on LSD.

988
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,520
I think your testimony

989
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,400
just may have touched her.

990
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:39,900
Great.

991
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,200
Let me fire up here on the board and see what happens, okay?

992
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,720
Zena.

993
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,720
Yes.

994
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,060
Oh, it's a young man.

995
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:46,660
Yeah.

996
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,580
Sorry.

997
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,180
Hi.

998
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,240
How long have you been listening?

999
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,420
Um, I just found your station tonight, actually.

1000
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,240
Tonight?

1001
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:55,820
Yeah.

1002
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,940
What were you looking for?

1003
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,160
Excuse me?

1004
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,640
What were you looking for?

1005
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,360
I was just flipping the radio around

1006
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,600
trying to find some help to take my mind off

1007
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,080
what was happening, and I came across your

1008
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,040
words, and they really were moving me.

1009
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,440
What's your problem?

1010
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,280
And I'm having a problem

1011
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,360
with LSD.

1012
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,520
Did you hear the gentleman I was just talking to,

1013
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:18,940
Tim Story?

1014
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:19,760
What?

1015
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,540
Did you hear the guy that was just talking?

1016
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,340
No.

1017
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,600
You weren't listening?

1018
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,640
No, I was... No, I'm sorry.

1019
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,740
What were you doing?

1020
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,300
Huh?

1021
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,120
What were you doing?

1022
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,200
I was trying to... I don't know. I was just thinking about

1023
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,420
what was going on, and I'm hoping

1024
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,400
that Jesus can help me through this.

1025
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,400
You think so, huh?

1026
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,420
I hope so. I've only done it once,

1027
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,240
but I did it about

1028
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,160
two hours ago.

1029
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,420
I want to tell you what

1030
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,140
I saw. I was lying in bed.

1031
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,260
This is

1032
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,920
frightening, but

1033
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,460
I saw Jesus

1034
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,600
crawling over the edge of my bed

1035
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,600
with a knife in his mouth, and I don't

1036
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,460
know what to do about it.

1037
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,260
Crawling over the edge of your bed with a knife in his mouth?

1038
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,680
Yeah.

1039
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:02,860
Tim!

1040
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,780
Yes, sir?

1041
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,820
You think that maybe Jesus is going to cut the ropes?

1042
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,280
He's going to change them.

1043
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,420
He can do it.

1044
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,280
Hey, Zena,

1045
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,200
will you be made well tonight?

1046
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:13,960
Yes.

1047
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,000
Tim, you want to pray? You feel you don't need to pray? Should I pray?

1048
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,240
You start, and I'll come right behind you.

1049
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,760
Okay. Zena.

1050
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,380
Yes?

1051
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,800
I want you to say this after me.

1052
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,420
Okay.

1053
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,120
Ready?

1054
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,720
Yes.

1055
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,400
Jesus.

1056
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,060
Jesus.

1057
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,960
Cut the ropes.

1058
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,320
Cut the rope.

1059
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,460
I want to be free.

1060
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,720
I want to be free.

1061
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,860
Cut that name.

1062
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,760
Cut that name.

1063
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,460
LSD.

1064
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:35,900
LSD.

1065
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:36,580
In half.

1066
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,840
In half.

1067
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,200
Cut that name.

1068
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,220
Cut that name.

1069
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,560
Sin.

1070
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,780
Sin.

1071
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,340
In half.

1072
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,140
In half.

1073
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,160
I want to be free.

1074
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,500
I want to be free.

1075
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,560
Close your eyes. Lift your hand.

1076
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,320
It's done.

1077
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,480
Thank you, Lord Jesus.

1078
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,200
Let the power of the Holy Ghost fall on you now.

1079
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:51,640
Peace!

1080
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,000
Lord, I thank you for your delivering power, and I just pray right now that you just touch

1081
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,620
him where he is.

1082
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,060
I'm seeing.

1083
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,760
From the top of his head to the bottom of his feet.

1084
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,660
I'm seeing.

1085
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,320
We just come against every demonic force.

1086
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,460
Jesus, it's a period for me right now.

1087
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,680
I can't see him.

1088
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,520
I can't blast it out of his body.

1089
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,220
Jesus' name.

1090
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:05,980
Hold it.

1091
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,660
This is not by accident he's listening.

1092
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,680
This is a God idea.

1093
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,200
I can.

1094
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,500
Lord, I thank you for blasting it out of him.

1095
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:11,980
I can.

1096
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:15,900
I pray the spirit of joy would come into his body right now.

1097
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,100
Lord, I pray right now the spirit of joy would come into him.

1098
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,380
Build.

1099
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,300
Lord, I thank you that there's more like hot oil over his body.

1100
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,620
From the top of his head to the bottom of his feet.

1101
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,240
I thank you that he's feeling the heat going right through him.

1102
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,520
Thank you that he's free.

1103
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,120
That he's free.

1104
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,820
And I want you just to get up right now and just begin to rejoice.

1105
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,440
I'm hearing.

1106
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,440


1107
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,440


1108
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,620
You're up and blasting your body.

1109
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,240
I'm getting lost.

1110
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,340
In Jesus' name, amen and amen.

1111
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,620
Cena, what's happening?

1112
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,640
Jesus wants to kiss me.

1113
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,900
You mean he's right there with you?

1114
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,460
Yes.

1115
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,840
Well, be free, Bren.

1116
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,540
He wants to kiss me.

1117
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:47,920
Go ahead.

1118
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,800
I'm kissing Jesus.

1119
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,000
Hello?

1120
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:55,900
Tim?

1121
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,200
I think you went under the power.

1122
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,520
Phone got cut off, so whatever.

1123
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,440
That man's getting lost.

1124
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,020
He's not getting delivered there.

1125
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:04,860
Or something.

1126
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,100
God.

1127
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,240
Amen.

1128
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,660
Well, brother, it's wonderful what God will do.

1129
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,540
He'll do it.

1130
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,100
Well, I was talking about God using ordinary people.

1131
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,680
Right.

1132
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,040
So this guy had some problems, and at least he wasn't nursing them and cursing them.

1133
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,440
He called and tried to disperse them and rebrought a guy to reverse them.

1134
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:23,860
Amen.

1135
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:24,860
Amen.

1136
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,980


1137
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,160
Thanks for watching!
