just work uh... christian trucker
among home truckers write and uh... man earth tough just how
who have a lifestyle it cameager tired of sheet ministry and outreach work for truckers that i tell you what listen to your show on the radio that he is working it give Jewishmen totally!
But it's been a real blessing to me because I'm learning how to deal with people, you know,
and telling some of these.
There's a lot of guys that they were Christians at one time, you know.
Backslidden.
Yeah, and they slid into this thing of feeling sorry for themselves.
Hey, you know, listen, you know, Brother Steve.
On the road again.
Cross.
Right.
Hallelujah.
And it's, you know, it's what they need to hear a lot of times.
Thank you, Jesus.
You know, and because these guys, you wouldn't believe it.
These are guys that don't make a great deal of money.
They make okay money.
But all these guys buy more cocaine in a week than Robert Chilton Ministries.
I mean.
I don't know about that.
I've never heard about that.
It's okay.
Well, you know, it's incredible what these guys do.
We don't, when we talk to them, we've learned a lot from listening to Praise in the Nights.
You know.
We don't let them tell these stories, you know, these hard luck stories.
It's like, get to the point.
Tell them what your problem is.
Shit, let's talk about salvation, you know.
Right.
And quit moping and meandering around the cross.
Sorry ass, you know, feeling sorry for yourself.
You need to watch your language.
What did you just say?
What?
What did you say?
Sorry what?
Oh, I said taking the sorry path of feeling.
Oh, sorry path.
Yeah.
Oh, good.
Okay.
Because, you know, they're moping and meandering around the cross.
Right.
And, you know, feeling sorry for themselves.
I say, you know, wake up, Christians.
The time is short.
Amen.
Treat you.
Get your thumbs out of your ass.
Get, get.
Is that what he said?
Get that guy off.
There he was.
Man, I'll tell you.
Hey, it's radio.
You know, good spirit, huh?
Yeah.
What's it tonight?
Is it a full moon or something?
Come on, man.
If you're going to be on radio, use your head.
You can't be full of the Holy Ghost and talk like that on radio or off radio.
Give me a break.
Use some common sense.
That's right, friends.
You got some sense.
Oh, well, I'm sorry about those awkward cuts there.
But, you know, that guy let a bunch of real bad language slip by and didn't didn't even notice until the guy got to the stuff that everybody else doesn't worry about playing anymore.
So, we're going to go ahead and get right to the point.
Oh, my God.
What a world.
Well, that tape was given to us from Brother Russell Ministries.
And, you know, to tell the truth, I probably shouldn't give their address.
He told me to feel free to write for more info or goodies.
It's in that tape trading world.
It's a limbo nightmare world, friends, where a lot of this stuff comes from.
It's the traders of, shall we say, tape.













Recordings of sociological experiments, often using the telephone as a medium of experimentation upon the minds of those who listen.
Well, those who out there would be preaching and they preaching good enough.
Friends, you're going to hear some good preaching tonight.
I don't know which, but there's always some kind of good preaching on this thing.
In the meantime, let's follow what that fellow suggested.
And, you know, if you're going to be on the radio.
Make some sense, okay?
Susie, Susie, Susie, I want you to croak a last few words to the listeners who generally are used to hearing your sparkling laughter and clear, clear, soothing voice.
And instead they get this.
Ah, beauty is only skin deep, but slack goes all the way to the bone.
Ah.
You...
I second that.
Please, Bob.
My comic books, my comic books will testify to that fact.
And now, back to the Betty Boop scandals.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Professor Knutsenbolz is one of the foremost scientists in this country, you screwball.
Oh, what you hit me for, Mo?
Just trying to knock some sense into your head.


















Uh.
Beklah, begle, begle, beg combinelos
Beklah, begle, begle, beg atoms

Stress isn't a problem, Tom.

Bob dear friends this mute I don't know what to call it in the background this
is a by the good Reverend Toe Fropphauser I love to say his name that's
Toe Fropphauser Toe Reverend Toe Fropphauser he sent us this tape full of
noise it's kind of cool noise it's so over modulated artistically listen to that
well actually but that does kind of hurt
enclosed you will find a copy of my stupid tape Fruit and Feener I have
sent it to you in the hopes that you will find it entertaining and or useful
please feel free to give copies of this tape to anyone you think would enjoy it
although I prefer you sent email at abruptly taunting it down
or on the non Cinematography website
an BuyBuyakan
that's
713-493-3203, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Well, see?
Now, friends, if you were on the Internet,
you'd already have memorized those ridiculous numbers.
And, well, friends, let's get religious now.
Let's go to a live subgenius devival,
as it happens, months ago in Cleveland,
with live on stage in the tent,
the big tent show that Brother Steve Bevilacqua produced,
the most recent one.
Oh, this is really distracting sound effect music in the background.
This particular sermon was broadcast about four shows ago,
but this is different.
This is the live version.
We broadcast a studio version, I believe, back about show 502.
This one here is 505.
I mistakenly called 502 503.
See, now you just got to remember to do HTTP.
It's got the western salami in it.
Yes, it's got your own rich, moist Texas salami in it.
Friends, I have a confession to make.
I, I, well, there aren't many sins in the church of the subgenius,
but I committed one, the stupidest sin of all.
A couple of months ago, I worked too hard on Slack.
Oh, I thought Bob was going to be so proud of me.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was in 1875.
I'd been preaching in a saloon in Kansas City.
Kansas City wasn't a very big town then.
I was crawled out of the saloon, crawled underneath the saloon.
I'd been preaching in the saloon, and I had a bit too much to drink.
I was crawling through the,
muddy streets of Kansas City.
There was a thunderstorm going on.
The, there were literally rivers of washing through the streets.
They weren't paved back then.
I, I crawled out of that saloon, and who should I see riding by on a great big white horse
but J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, wearing a great big old cowboy hat and thick cowboy boots.
I'm a subgenius preacher.
I saw my personal story.
I saw my personal savior ride by.
So of course, I had to lick his boots.
Yes, I saw Bob and I had to lick his boots.
I'm a preacher.
In fact, I had to kiss his boots.
He, he just, I just ran alongside the horse, licking away on Bob's boots.
I didn't care if he'd been walking through the, through the prairie stepping on buffalo
chips and pasture pastries and meadow muffins.
I didn't care if he'd been walking through the horse awful filled streets.
I didn't care what was on Bob's boot.
But I licked it.
Oh, I worked hard licking Bob's boots.
I licked and kissed and licked and kissed.
It was disgusting.
Didn't taste real good.
But you know, when you see Bob's boot cheeks, you gotta kiss them.
And I was thinking, oh, won't Bob be proud of me?

Oh, Bob's gonna be so damn proud because I worked so hard for slack.
And friends, my lips got chapped from licking Bob's boots.
They got more chapped than my chaps.
They were like creaking leather beaks.
I couldn't preach.
I couldn't even smile.
I could, to eat a hamburger, I had to flatten it down and feed it in through the slit.
Oh, Bob.
I had to take saddle soap and rub it all over my mouth in order to loosen up those leathery,
saddle-like lips from kissing Bob's damn boots for too long.
My lips were cracking and bleeding.
And getting that lemon oil and saddle soap out.
I was sick, friends.
I made myself sick working too hard for Bob.
And you know what Bob did?
He said, thanks for cleaning my boots.
I said, thanks for cleaning my boots, dumbass.
And he left me with the virus and the yeast.
But friends, I then learned my lesson.
I knew what to do.
I knew it was time, finally, to truly slack off.
I pulled out my six-gun and I shot Bob Dobbs in the back.
Must have been the right Bob because, you know, he just kept riding on.
But I slacked off.
And that crust on my lips, that's what I called it.











And I slacked off.
And that's why I'm here to preach to you tonight.
And this is where I started talking about the bats and it got a little bit too, well,
just a bit too raunchy.
I had truly learned my lesson.
No more would I work too hard for slack.
In fact, I'm tired of doing this right now.
Maybe I ought to just quit.
I think I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done.




I'm done.




Let's enjoy the night together.
In the thicketened darkness I'll sit in a tower of red
I next time I'm gonna bring a Saint personal avatar
In line with an all white bunny
Pop out of Las Vegas, all will bleed on the ground
for no one who's home bought my ticket.
let's go out to Hollywood with Bob do what I tell you d'ya colorful thing.
Dumb cowboy, and I know what done wrong.
That song always makes me cry.
Of course, Eddie Arnold did it better, but it still makes me cry.
It's so sad.
I'll go outside every while.
We've only got half an hour left.
We've got to have Circus Apocalypse.
We've got to have the head launch.
The head launch.
The head launch.
And we've got to have...
I've got to get this news around my neck.
And the testimonials.
And since Melody's talking.
String him up!
String him up!
God damn it, idiot.
Can't even tie a hangman's knot.
Take that.
Take another pill.
I can't even.
Take another pill.
Well, they're going to do this song about pills.
This has got to be the most pill-soaked revival ever.
People are going to leave this revival going,
well, I thought they were going to be preaching about how evil the conspiracy is,
but all they did was talk about pills.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
How many words can you think of that rhyme with pill?
Take another pill.
It'll cure every ill.
Take another pill.
Your brain will become nil.
Take another pill.
It will make you want to kill.
Take another pill.
Leave it on the windowsill.
Take another pill.
Put your mind through rototill.
Take another pill.
Just throw it on the grill.
Take another pill.
Fall down like Jack and Jill.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
The vomit will start to spill.
Take another pill.
Hey, bungalow bill.
Just take another pill.
Brew it up in your still.
Take another pill.
This is not a drill.
Take another pill.
It will make you feel evil.
Take another pill.
You won't be happy until.
Take another pill.
And come back for a refill.
Take another pill.
To do otherwise is unacceptable.
Take another pill.
To do otherwise would be impossible.
Take another pill.
Pickled like a dill.
Take another pill.
You'll feel like roadkill.
Take another pill.
Yo, yo, chill.
Take another pill.
Walk through the daffodils.
Take another pill.
You'll be sprouting kills.
Take another pill.
It's such a thrill.
Take another pill.
If you've been through the mill.
Take another pill.
You'll end up on boot hill.
Take another pill.
Whales take them with their krill.
Take another pill.
And I can't think of any more.
Take another pill.
That's the end of it.
I'm on leave.
Take another pill.
I took some.
I took so many pills.
I...
This nun suit is...
It's tight.
It's gripping my...
All these panties don't fit.
I...
Wait a minute.
I shouldn't even wear it.
Take another pill.
Slack can only be sold.
Take another pill.
It cannot be bought.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
Hey, can you guys do golfing music?
Yes.
Take another pill.
Because we got us a head to launch.
Yeah!
Take another pill.
Are you ready?
There's many golfer heads out there.
There's people that like to launch the lips of Lee Trevino.
Oh, yeah.
There's those out there who would put a rocket up
and launch into outer space the feet of Sam Snead.
Oh, yeah.
Jack Nicklaus tongues have been launched in our public school.

School system, damn it.
Thanks to the Trevinas.
But when was the last time you gazed bare eyeballed upon the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?
Ah!
The head!
The head!
Why?
Why?
Why?
The head asked why.
Notice.
Notice this neck stump.
Notice this wound on the forehead.
They didn't just cut his head off, man.
I don't know what they did to him.
They didn't just cut his head off.
Where's the sacred tea?
Where's the holy nine iron?
There is no sacred tea.
There is no holy nine iron.
God damn it.
We're just going to have to launch it without.
We're going to have to boot the damn head.
Yep, we're going to have to launch the head by foot.
All right.
It's a beautiful ceremony, friends.
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
In the name of Arnold Palmer himself.
The true bleeding head.
In the name of Flo Tan.
In the name of Brandon Stimpy.
In the name of Jimi Hendrix.
I can't do it.
I can't.
Oh.
Watch that head, friends.
Okay, launch it back this way.
Launch that head back this way, friends.
That's a $500 head.
Oh.
It bounced.
And his eyes are still intact.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Excuse me.












Excuse me, friends.
I've seen so many head launchings.
That was a nice head launching.
And we did get the, you know, of course, when you hear me doing a head launching, friends,
we're probably using the replica head.
It's pretty realistic.
And a lot of people probably don't know the difference.
And, you know, it's like faith healing.
It still works.
Now, on the other hand, when you see Pope Sternodoc's keycaver,
or St. Jane or hyperclites launching that head,
you better not let any of that blood drip on you, my man, my sir ma'am, my woman.
The universe would have ended instantly.
Because it's just not, the time is not yet nigh for their arisal.
But I'm going to preach.
What we're really doing here, friends, is fighting a war.
This is a war.
Believe it or not, not very good soldiers,
but, you know,
the conspiracy has something like 50,000 nuclear weapons.
The Church of the Subgenius only has three.
And yet we dare to fight them anyway.
Because it's always been, it's always been the crazy people,
the maniacs, who are the only ones dumb enough to fight City Hall.
And one of these days we're going to win.
But it is a war, friends.
It's a war of the mind.
It's a war of the humans versus the subgeniuses.
It's us versus them.
Don't you just hate them?
And the great thing about this church is,
them is anybody you don't like.
Praise Bob.
The subgeniuses versus the humans.
And you know the ironic thing is,
we're the ones who designed the humans 80,000 years ago in Mutantis.
Our worst mistake, dear friends, a dreadful mistake.
Because you gaze out, go outside, go to your job,
go look around this room, you'll see the humans,
the normals, the mediocritons, the pink boys,
the Barbies and Kens, the cage dwellers.
We've got more nasty words for them than they even have for us.
Because we're the humans.
Because the problem is pinkness equals boredom.
The pink is afraid of that which is different.
They are what you might call xenophobes.
The subgenius is what you would call a xenophile.
We get off on things that are different.
We don't necessarily like them,
but when we first see them, we go,
Shit, that's weird as hell. That's disgusting.
Tell me more.
The pink will say, string them up.
We wait and then say, string them up.
But friends, it is a religion.
Among other things, sure, it's a big stupid art project,
an excuse for disgusting no good, good for nothings,
like these guys to get up and jam.
But it is a religion, friends.
It's a living, bleeding religion for today.
It's not one of these old-fashioned religions
for some guy who's been dead for a long time.
He's been dead for ten years.
He hasn't answered his message machine in 2,000 years.
And when we talk about the conspiracy,
oh yeah, that's a big joke, they're thinking,
yeah, they're making fun of those conspiracy kooks.
We're talking about the conspiracy that is so f***ing dumb
that it doesn't even know that it is a conspiracy.
They do not even know how bad they def***** over themselves,
and much worse, us.
Pinks, friends.
The conspiracy is a lot bigger than Republicans versus Democrats,
or Communists versus Capitalists.
The conspiracy is nothing but an attitude of distrust.
They distrust anything they don't understand,
and they don't understand much at all.
Yeah, the conspiracy, it's a real big joke.
About as funny as the headlines in today's press conference.

It's paper, don't you think?
Yep, it's not a clever conspiracy.
It doesn't even know it's a damn conspiracy.
It's a confederacy of dunces.
The pinks are literally stereotypes of themselves.
Mindless bovine stereotypes, like a herd of cows,
and yet, they could destroy the world.
In fact, they may already have.
We're gonna destroy the world too,
but we want to make sure the end of the world happens properly.
False prophets, dear friends.
False prophets surround us.
And the worst thing about them is,
they call us wolves in sheep's clothing.
I'd sure rather be a wolf in sheep's clothing
than sheep in wolves' clothing.
Which is what we're dealing with.
Now you may notice that things seem to be getting a little worse these days.
Everybody's got cancer.
You get a new disease every time you screw somebody.
There's poisons in the air.
The weather's kind of funny lately.
And the world is horribly overpopulated,
and so forth and so on.
You think about how bad it is now.
Think about what they're not telling you about.
Well, they've got all kinds of tricks up their sleeves.
And they call the Church of the Subgenius some kind of a cult.
Oh yeah, a cult.
I don't know, it seems like if the United States can get millions of people
to bury toxic waste in their own backyards,
how is that any different from Jim Jones getting 900 people to commit suicide?
America is a cult these days.
Praise Rush Limbaugh.
The ATF is a cult, for that matter.
The ax khaki, nothing but axes against the clock.
хрю xemерBC

What has you done?
I think there's some bad coisaе So why would you leave the living person
hanging?
Because they buried it.


They don't have a life here today.

Sometimes an actor upon a forever lie
can enter a tent Boules Malaysian
and they can transformer it.
to an empty house.
Bob never said, Bob's no communist.
He doesn't want everybody equally poor.
Bob Dobbs wants everybody equally rich,
but without working.
Without working, dear friend.
Oh, but you say, oh, I don't work,
but that's all, I don't work for the conspiracy.
I'm a freelancer, I sell art, I'm in a band.
The conspiracy can't get me.
Oh, no, I don't work for the conspiracy.
You are, everybody works for the conspiracy.
They've got you by the balls or the ovaries.
All the time, and all the, right now,
they're probably just kind of tickling.
They've got you on a leash,
and they'll let you run pretty far on that leash.
But when they decide you've run far enough,
when you've got a real good head of steam up,
you're trotting along going,
man, I guess I'm free of the conspiracy.
Wow!
They yank that leash back,
and you never get back.
Never forget.
Never forget again, friends.
You may forget the conspiracy for a minute,
but they'll never forget you.
They hate you worse than you hate them,
and they don't even know you.
As Bob Dobbs said,
act like a dumb shit.
Act like a dumb shit,
and they will treat you as an equal.
Truer and sadder words were never spoken, dear friend.
Wow.
Man, what a devival.
Well, that left me feeling pretty devived,
I'll tell you, friends.
But actually, it is such a joy to work with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
I don't know what it is.
I just love doing stuff with those guys.
They're in Cleveland,
and they're on WCSB there in Cleveland every Thursday,
what is it, Thursday nights at 10?
10 o'clock or 11?
I never can remember.
I know we go from about 11.30 to 1,
and it always supplies me with an hour of slack material.
It's just such a joy to not have to do it by myself sometimes, you know?
And now, as we come down near the end of side one
of this hideous radio show,
we wonder what will be next.
Well, I'm wondering what's going to be next.
But as I've said before, by the time,
well, actually, by the time you hear this,
I may be back from the GWAR tour.
Let's flip this show over and see what I'm going to have to listen to
nine nights in a row,
starting next week for me.
Who dies?
What a chance!
Who stands?

Ha ha ha ha!
That's the rub!
For in that sleep of sin,
what kingdom may come?
What of the limitless sex and violence
in the wake of Ragnarok?
Welcome to the slaughter!
What are you going to do?
What will be your epitaph?
When we get done with you,
are you going to cry for your mama?
Or are you going to have a good time?
Are you going to be a boheme?
When did you return to die?
Don't get crazy, crazy!
Let them all around!
Parakeet!
They are through the streets!
It's a Ragnarok project!
What is wrong?
You're painting, you're turning, you're burning,
you're sanitizing, you're white-eyed.
The final hour's here, no rap, you're from a villa,
you're out in game for one damn night.
The woman gets a job, but you're gonna have some fun.
Nothing else to do, you're praying for another day.
The only dirty twin is that mind,
you're all sitting, sitting feels so fine.
You're running for no time!
Action to action!
Yeah!
It's always one hell of a party
When Ragnarok throws a crowd
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!
It's time to trash the party
Ragnarok and man, no crowd
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!
Welcome to Valhalla!
Do not be afraid!
Now you are a zombie!
Have all your friends been dead!
It all gets rarer than hockey!
When you get backstage,
everybody gets a grounder!
I hope you're underrated!
When the trouble of me offends me
Body out the edge of war, but I won't come down!
Looking for a lover, no need to worry
I'll have a Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!
Come on, find somebody and get to the very bloody!
Never falling, feeding, never joking
Choking, never joking, laughing, never loaded
You know there's a lot of fun!
Ragnar, you're running out of time!
Dust to dust!
Stare, but there's no way out!
Oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh!
Ain't going one hell of a party
When Ragnarok rolls around
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!
It's time to smash the planet here
Ragnarok and man, no crowd
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!
That's the plan, yeah!
It's always one hell of a party when Ragnarok rolls around.
Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls.
Go out and chat your city, it's Ragnarok battleground.
Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls.
Ragnarok rolls.
And she's buying the stairway to heaven.
Oh man, I'm going to be spending nine or ten, no, something like eleven days in a bus with those guys.
And do you know what those guys look like? Do you know what that group GWAR looks like?
The lead singer, Odorus Urungus, looks like he's got...
maggots crawling out of his face, which isn't even much of a face at all.
It's like a destroyed skull, maggot, demon, bottle of rum, CD, real dead, purple skull cow.
Oh man.
Yeah, I've been hanging around with doctors for Bob for all these years now.
It's the GWAR universe.
We will destroy you humans.
You all humans must crawl beneath the grate.
The might of GWAR and Bob as he comes to rip your face off.
Actually, I think this show may feature such scenes as Slydenstra Hymen gets impregnated by some...
Well, these aliens, these aliens abduct Odorus, I think, and...
They extract some sperm from...
Odorus Urungus and it accidentally gets Slydenstra Hymen pregnant.
They crucify her and give her an abortion while she's being...
crucified.
But the baby escapes and falls in with the aliens and then God arrives.
But it turns out God's nothing but a big robot.
Oh, I don't want to give away the whole plot.
Anyway, the way they put it to me over the phone, they go,
What our show's work is every three songs...
No, he said every two songs we kill or rape somebody.
Yeah, man, those guys, they have their own special version of slack.
But you know their message is the same.
It's a message of hate.
It's just like the message of this church.
A message of hate and agony for our enemies.
And pure degeneracy.
And...
Wallowing in slack for ourselves.
Praise Bob.
And I was going to shut up and make this be a music show because you all have already heard me ranting enough.
And what do we have coming up next here?
It's music by your fellow subgeniuses.
Let's pull this little wellman head through here.
This is Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.
And here we go.
This ought to be pertinent.
This ought to be pertinent.
This ought to be pertinent.
This ought to pertinent.
Let's get this 승å Gulfwизern.







No really.

music will set me free.
I'm gonna have a big house
and two cars. I'll have more
money than I can spend.
Because I'm gonna be rich
and famous, yes sir.
And then I can buy some friends. And then I can
buy some friends. And then I can buy some
friends.
Being famous really knocks me
out. It's not so fun
you know.
And my fame will make it to the
top if we ever do the
lock and load.
Yeah baby,
that's the way.
You got the room,
you got the room.
That's right.
We're so cool.
I think I'm gonna choke on the old
vomit.
I'll be so famous.
I'll have some cash.
Famous.
I can buy me some cash.
Famous.
Famous.
I can buy me a car.
So famous.
It'll be so bizarre.
Now people don't even know me
because I'm nobody now you see.
But one day people are gonna
know me because my music
will set me free.
I'm gonna have a big house
and two cars. I'll have more
money than I can spend.
Because I'm gonna be rich
and famous.
And then I can buy me a car.
And then I can buy some friends.
And then I can buy some friends.
And then I can buy some friends.
And then I can buy some friends.
Oh Lord, thank you for your baptism of fire.
I'll tell you what, the fire of the Holy Ghost falls on you.
Something's gonna happen.
Some will cry out.
Some will laugh.
Some will just weep.
Some will swoon.
Peter said these aren't drunk as you suppose.
Why would Peter say these aren't drunk as you suppose?
Do they look like they were drunk maybe?
Possibly.
Possibly?
I'd say more than that.
More than possible.
They accuse him of being drunk.
These are drunk.
He said no, no, no, no, no.
Not the way you think.
This is something entirely different.
Just say Jesus.
Just say Jesus.

I want it all.
I want it all.
Lord, fill her right now.
Fill.
Just fill her Lord.
Say Jesus, I lift my cup.
Say Jesus, I lift my cup.
Fill it up.
Fill it up.
Fill it up.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
No hope.
No hope.
Hee hee.
Hee hee.
No hope.
No hope.
No hope.

Thank you, Jesus.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
No hope.
No hope.
No hope.
Hee hee.
More.
Hee hee.
More.
More.
More.
More.
More.
More.
More.
I guess we're in the wrong religion, friends.
These guys are having so much more fun, I can't believe it.
Have another drink, look.
Thank you.
Thank me, thank him.
Thank you, Jesus.
Jesus said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.
That was awesome.
Fill.
Something's happening up there.
Something's happening over there.
I believe the Lord's just going to pour out just abundance of joy tonight.
Be back in a few moments.
Don't go away.
That's no way to talk.
Don't ask me to speak a word.
I'm fed up with all your bullshit.
Soon I'll go away.
But you'll find another victim.
You'll find another victim.
You say that I'm paranoid.
It makes sense.
You think you're blameless.
You just write me off.
Jack.
And go on with your business.
And go on with your business.
Don't act like you're on my side.
When you like me for one reason.
You don't have a clue to what in the hell I'm after.
What in the hell I'm after.
What the f*** are you looking at?
You're not.
One day I'm gonna pick up my guitar.
And play it for myself.
And no one else.
No more freebies.
And if I can't pay my bills.
I'll never whiz the will of the people.
It's not that I haven't tried.
But there's a limit to my patience.
Bet your ass.
You can't win.
You can't stand your money on bullshit.
Reward the mean if you please.
Who are just in it for the bucks.
A pack of opportunists.
Who get stronger as they make you.
They lie to you when you believe them.
Just like they got you a new tip.
Their music is all the same.
They can barely write their own name.
By supporting him.
What does that make you?
By giving money to a stranger.
While neglecting the needs of your own.
Harvest what you can and what remains.
Because tomorrow you'll be empty and alone.
I feel like I'm doing this for nothing.
Don't have a house.
Can't pay the rent.
While you go to shows by those who didn't give a shit.
The whole affair's an embarrassment.
I'm not a fool.














Bet your ass.
You can't win.
You can't stand your money on bullshit.
What goes around comes around.
And sucks it up.
The thing is when to vote probably remains planned.
Essa Andrea perdido tu� esta que es.
The family spray with their face for Captain America.
Is that where all of that else parties from highways go?

Thank you, Lord, for your touch.
Until the day I have declined.
David.
We've got these little machines that tell us phone numbers when people call in now.
You've got the caller ID stuff.
So we can find out what phone number you call from.
And if you're going to act in such a way.
I mean, just not right.
Well, matter of fact, even worse than that.
Jesus says this.
I say unto you, Matthew 12, 36, that every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment.
For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
So if you say, oh, my back's all messed up now,
don't be surprised if that thing or something similar or worse really comes upon you.
So don't play around with the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
Don't think you're going to get by with anything.
You get nothing better to do than sit around.
And play on the telephone.
You see, you'll have to answer to God for that.
It's a serious thing to be involved in.
This is not a game.
It's not a show.
This is kingdom of God business.
This is kingdom of God business.
Well, I used to be a sinner.
Because I truly did believe that the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and me were thick-ass thieves.
And I used to give my dough to tell evangelistic snobs.
Then the light had shone upon me, and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Now my wallet belongs to Bob.
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.
Well, my heart is for my honey.
My brain is for my job.
But my wallet belongs to Bob.
Well, Bobby goes a-fropping every chance that he can get.
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat.
So I gave him all my money.
Reverend Stang said it was right.
And for only...
Twenty dollars.
He did save my soul tonight.
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob.
Because my wallet belongs to Bob.
Well, Bobby's got his sweetie and Connie is her name.
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard.
And pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card.
So my wallet belongs to Bob.
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.
And I never have to fear.
Because I know Connie's on the job.
Because my wallet belongs to Bob.
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too.
Their existential energy may be what's right for you.
But someday you'll grow weary of those pagan egos.



And you'll be a mystic cult.
And give away your money to the one that gets results.
And then your wallet will be for Bob.
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob.
Because your wallet will be for Bob.
Well, I believe I am much calmer.
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
Sitting on the dashboard of my car.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.



No, ladies.
Sister Melodious Chops, dear friend.
Available on the wonderful subgenius type, hairs in Bob's ears.
Oh yes, dear friend.
Sister Melodious Chops there with Princess Wee Ardo backing her up at the latest Cleveland
D-Vival back in July, I guess it was.
And old woman.
It was a beautiful revival.
One of Steve Bevilacqua's jobbies.
I'm going to be at one in three days.
No, two days.
In two days, I'll be at another one.
Only it's the wake of Dr. Legume.
Friends, I've done four hours of slack in one day.
You can probably hear it in my voice.
That one's a song.
A good Jimmy Ryan song.
But there ain't time for that right now.
Now, I know what there's time for.
There's always, there's always time, dear friends,
to give out the subgenius post office box number,
which is, of course,
a post office box.
1-4-0-3-0-6.
In lovely Dallas, Texas.
That's right.
Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.
Dallas, Texas.
7-5-2-1-4.
That's where you write to to get to Bob,
get free information about the church and the subgenius.
Uh, just, uh, just, uh, you do have to put a stamp on it,
but it helps if you hold it against your lap and think Dallas.
And just address that to Bob, P.O. Box, 1-4-0-3-0-6.
Dallas, Texas.
7-5-2-1-4.
And Bob's your uncle, my friend.
Yes, Bob is your big brother.
Your big old brother.
Our children, it's time for recess.
Please roll up your sleeves.
More toe-frop-houser there, friend.
Whoa, it's still rolling.

Now, if it's just a show, just show business, that's one thing.
But if it's a Holy Ghost, and you mess around with the Holy Ghost,
and mess around with God and his people,
I'll tell you what, you'll be, um, it's not a pleasant situation to be in.
I pray maybe God would give you repentance
unto the acknowledgement of the truth.
Perhaps God would.
Maybe he won't.
It's up to God.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
I want a woman.
I want a woman.
I want a woman.
I want a woman.
I want a woman.
