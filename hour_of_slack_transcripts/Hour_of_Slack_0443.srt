1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
It's reality. Goodbye.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,260
Come on, kids. Come on. Come on. Come on.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,020
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,240
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
The subgenius power of SWAT.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,000
Why should you plead for that?

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,340
Because it's great.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,480
There's so little in life that's noble or beautiful.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,260
I'm pleading for a man's achievement.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,980
I'm pleading for greatness.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,320
Yep, it went and screwed up again.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,560
Once again.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,700
Now what's my problem?

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,700
Do I hear any horrible noises?

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,580
I guess something shorted out when I touched over here.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,600
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,420
We are having operating difficulties,

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,660
which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our...

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,720
Subgenius.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,420
Power of SWAT.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,260
Subgenius.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,340
There is nothing wrong with your television set.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,340
Only because you're listening to the radio.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,220
Do not attempt to adjust the picture.

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,520
No, there is no picture.

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,980
We are controlling transmission.

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,060
Subgenius.

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,020
And now speaking for the management.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,420
Oh, yes, your host and good prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,260
An incompetent amateur who has the arrogance to hold his own ideas above all rules.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,980
That's me, dear friend.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,080
That's your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,060
Breaking the rules without knowing what the rules were to begin with.

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,260
And why?

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,580
Because we don't have very good equipment.

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,920
We're really broke.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,520
And I know it sounds, to listen to the show,

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,340
why you'd think we were the most high-tech rich kids in the world.

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,740
But in fact, there's a four-year-old optimist video.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,800
And he's got a radio shack deck that we're recording on.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,040
There's this $10 radio shack microphone.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,380
I don't even know if the CD player works anymore.

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,120
Let's see.

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,640
I ain't hearing nothing.

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm wanting it, but I ain't hearing it.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,240
It's got a good hum to it.

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,340
You can always depend on our CD player for a hum.

48
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,020
It will hum to you.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
Let's put something in.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,600
And here, this is done almost as cheesy as us.

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,660
Don't pay any attention to all that public howling.

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,400
I don't.

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,640
I've been denounced so much, it doesn't bother me anymore.

54
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,000
I know how you feel about it.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,260
I started out in life as a coal miner.

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,920
Got where I am by acting on my own honest judgment,

57
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,240
whether others liked it or not.

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,220
When you grow older, you'll see that that's the only way to succeed in life.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,000
I know it.

60
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,040
They've been tough on you.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,860
They're going to get tougher.

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,440
But don't worry.

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,300
You'll win.

64
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,040
I have.

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,940
That's the only defense you need.

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll rest on the evidence.

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm going to give a pardon to celebrate the opening of Enright House.

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,340
I'll invite them all, the press, the architects, the critics.

70
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,900
Let them see.

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,980
If they think we're going to apologize, we'll celebrate instead.

72
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,940
I'm coming to steal the mail.

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,820
We will take your hand.

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:27,920
We will take your hand.

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,180
We'll talk it over.

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,300
Okay, sir.

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
Where did Vick be?

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,560


79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,560


80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Anybody know whoì£  victory was probably.

81
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,720
Here's a.

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Davis.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:57,920


84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:57,920


85
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
The Wall Men.

86
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
The Wall Men sound pretty different these days.

87
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,180
And, yes, the Church of the Subgenius

88
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,980
has probably sounded a little different.

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,060
The Hour of Slack has sounded a little different

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,720
because, dear friends, we're forced to do our show

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,320
here at the home studio.

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,620
If you could just bear with us,

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,460
that's all we can possibly ask.

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,960
It's just...

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,140
I can't understand how my own daughter

96
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,180
can approve of this preposterous message.

97
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,880
I don't like geniuses. They're dangerous.

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,460
How's that?

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,380
A man abler than his brothers insults them by implication.

100
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,120
He must not aspire to any virtue which cannot be shared.

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, I wouldn't know about that intellectual stuff.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,900
I play the stock market.

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,540
I play the stock market.

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm a marketer for spirit.

105
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,300
And I sell short.

106
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,300
It's stunning.

107
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,380
Perfectly stunning.

108
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,100
And it was, uh, the, uh,

109
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,200
unfortunately the new manager

110
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,260
at the old station,

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,140
K-N-O-N in Dallas,

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,820
where we used to originate.

113
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,240
Uh, all the...

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,240
Well, it's a Christian station now, basically.

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,700
Um, and, uh...

116
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,400
So if you detect a...

117
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,720
certain note of...

118
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,460
Let's not call it bitterness, exactly,

119
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,600
but, uh, okay, let's call it bitterness.

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,180
from your, uh, preacher,

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,300
Reverend Ivan Stang, uh, that

123
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,000
it may be because, uh, we

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
begin to feel a bit like a, uh,

125
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,580
prophet who is going without honor

126
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,700
in one's own land, don't you see it?

127
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,220
But, uh, we understand

128
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,120
that it is, uh, important

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,240
that we get back to the

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,100
basic, uh, uh,

131
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,160
reason for this whole show, which is,

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,180
of course, my friends, to...

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,920
Uh, now let's see if we can, uh,

134
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,980
change the speed on this, uh...

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
Uh, to praise

136
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,180
Bob!

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,360
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
It's a little better.

139
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,420
It sounds more like

140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,460
an hour of slack.

141
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,280
Slack.

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
And we can start back to...

143
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,200
Praise and Bob.

144
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,100
Uh-huh.

145
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,160
I may sound like a Bible-beater

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,320
yelling up a revival

147
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,920
at a river crossing camp meeting,

148
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,240
but that don't change the truth, none.

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,700
I'm tired of this New Age

150
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,660
gobbledygook, mumbo-jumbo

151
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,220
replacing Dobbs'

152
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,300
revealed doctrine

153
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,480
of the New Age supersonic

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,420
Nazi hill creatures from beneath

155
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,400
the hollow earth. I'm tired of

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,280
undead preachers preaching

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,220
undead sermons to

158
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,220
undead congregations.

159
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,860
I'm tired of ministers

160
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,620
who need three church secretaries

161
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,460
and a German shepherd and a

162
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,100
midget and what all

163
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,540
God only knows what all else for they can get

164
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,380
out there and preach the gospel

165
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,800
of slack. I'm tired of preachers

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,460
saying that God's gonna

167
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,360
kill them if they don't raise some money

168
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,100
and then God not

169
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,320
following through.

170
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,220
Bob is being blamed for at least two deaths in

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,020
20 injuries.

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,080
Not even President Bush's vacation home in

173
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,140
Kennebunkport, Maine was spared Bob's

174
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,940
winds and waves.

175
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,980
One person, though, died near New York City

176
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,700
when Bob threw a tree into a commuter train.

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,420
How has your life changed since Dobbs came into your life?

178
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,520
I realized that the exits are a reality

179
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,980
and that my life is geared towards their arrival.

180
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,520
I redefined my own space

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,980
and was able to

182
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,880
center my being.

183
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,000
When I first heard Bob on the radio

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660
he said that he could

185
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,680
heal and told me to put

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,540
my hand on the radio so that

187
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,720
the Bob energy could come out

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
through the airwaves.

189
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,360
The only cult they want to talk about is the

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,640
subgenius foundation, the church of the

191
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,300
subgenius.

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,780
If you plan to get saved,

193
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,980
you'd better do it now.

194
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,860
There will be a day not

195
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,380
in the future.

196
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,280
The too far distant future in which

197
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,320
Antichrist will be revealed

198
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,620
and the mark of the beast will be introduced.

199
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,860
I might point out that a lot of people worry about

200
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,800
the one world government that the conspiracy

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,900
is trying to get across.

202
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,440
We suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government is going to be a one world religion.

203
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,440
And of course that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.

204
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,600
When he says you shall have tribulation ten days, he means you're going to have a maximum of trouble.

205
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,660
And that's just the way things are.

206
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,380
The church is not at home in the world.

207
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,600
No, no, don't touch me.

208
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't think I'm not going to tell him about men.

209
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,320
What terrible things men do.

210
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,880
When he grows up, he's not going to know.

211
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,980
He's not going to know how to manhandle any poor little girls.

212
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,540
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers.

213
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,040
Old men turning young daughters into whores.

214
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,180
Now this is a crooked and perverse nation.

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,180
We have millions and multiplied millions of crooked politicians.

216
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,460
God put a death penalty upon adultery.

217
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,860
When we see millions and millions of men being killed,

218
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,680
multiplied by millions of people spending hours and hours before the television,

219
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,980
learning how to crack safes, rob banks, kill policemen, get divorced and break up homes.

220
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,980
All these soap operas, hour after hour, warps people's minds.

221
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,060
That shows that they're crooked.

222
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,760
That shows they're perverse.

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,680
That shows that they're stupid.

224
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,500
That shows they've got warped minds.

225
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,160
That shows they're not human.

226
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,020
That shows they're not human.

227
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,300
That shows they're not human.

228
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,140
You may be rich, a big business man with a big company,

229
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,800
and everyone kowtows to you when you come around,

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,680
but when you're lost, you're a nobody.

231
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,580
You're just a lost person, that's all.

232
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,880
And unless and until someone or something gets you straightened around

233
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,360
so that you know which direction to travel,

234
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,800
you just don't amount to very much.

235
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,980
You're not worth anything to yourself,

236
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,300
and you're not worth anything to anybody else.

237
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,780
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

238
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,980
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

239
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,460
Bob. Bob. Bob is. Bob is sex.

240
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
That's your key phrase.

241
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,200
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

242
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,580
We are controlling transmission.

243
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,500
Three, two, and one.

244
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,640
Now to continue with the tape recording.

245
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,220
Bob.

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,300
Bob's Mysterious Mysteries is brought to you by the Subgenius Foundation,

247
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:43,060
challenging the laughable garbage taught as truth in our public school systems since 1953.

248
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,460
No! No!

249
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,740
Dateline now.

250
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,000
I hold in my quivering hands proof.

251
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm not sure.

252
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,940
I do proof that we are not alone, dear friends.

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,500
Not even in the bathroom.

254
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,420
A much battered, old-looking phonograph record of the 78 RPM type

255
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,860
arrived yesterday at our offices in a plain brown wrapper.

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,880
Removing the inexplicable plain brown wrapper from our offices

257
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,880
and carefully deciphering the enclosed plain brown dried mud tablet,

258
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,620
painstakingly inscribed in Chaldean Aramaic and Top 40,

259
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,800
we soon became aware that not only is John Fitzgerald Kennedy

260
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,420
now piloting the Exist mothership currently patrolling the Saturnian space,

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:47,020
but he still finds time to pin most of the lyrics for Elvis's efforts to maintain a constant psychological warfare against the conspiracy.

262
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,040
And with the aid of his faithful cowboy companion, Chuck Connors,

263
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,080
to provide an important preview of tough times ahead for Bubba on planet Earth.

264
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:09,380
We present now the startling evidence of an impending invasion from outer space on the X-Man label.

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,920
.

266
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:10,920


267
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:10,920


268
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,900
We're gonna fry all the normals and put them all away

269
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,880
Tie them up and fry them up and burn them with death rays

270
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,000
The pink boys will not be found except within the blackened ground

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,920
That's where we'll leave them on next day

272
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,000
We're gonna fry all the normals and waste them in their beds

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,720
Tie them up and fry them up and whack off all their heads

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,360
The pink boys will not be found except within the blackened ground

275
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
That's where we'll leave them on next day

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,580
There on next day

277
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,380
Woo! Yee-haw!

278
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,960
Woo! Boy, that was inspiring!

279
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,320
I know who I'm gonna get to sing our theme song to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse here.

280
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,320
Woo! Well, everybody, everybody does the bob.

281
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,400
Oh, here it is.

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,000
Red in a bob!

283
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,900
Let's get ready to do the bob!

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,000
Woo!

285
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
Everybody bob.

286
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,920
Bob to the left.

287
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,340
Bob to the right.

288
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,900
Woo!

289
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,240
Now make up your own direction and bob.

290
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,700
To start a job, I gotta finish the job.

291
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,240
Finish, now cruising, doing the bob.

292
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,700
It's all a homie out there cruising in the Cadillac.

293
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,220
Yeah.

294
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,180
And a bop.

295
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,740
It's all the other boppers in the 98 to the 98.

296
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,200
Keep doing the bop.

297
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,400
It's all my homeboys riding in their Pintos and Cases.

298
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,300
Keep doing the bop.

299
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Keep going.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,500
All about the VWs.

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,020
Keep doing the bop.

302
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,120
Oh, yeah.

303
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,280
Look, look.

304
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,420
I've got the power.

305
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,920
Yeah.

306
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,500
Oh, yeah.

307
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Oh, not too much bass on that.

308
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,060
Oh, no, no, no problem.

309
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,580
What?

310
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,100
What?

311
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,320
Well, I guess we can ask Clayton to show me.

312
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:36,980
Yeah.

313
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,120
Oh, yeah.

314
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,820
Oh, yeah.

315
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,980
Thank you, and goodbye for now.

316
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,080
You're welcome.

317
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,160
There's the tweed.

318
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,160
Does that mean no tweed?

319
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Here it comes, here it comes, look out!

320
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:50,940
Look out!

321
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,980
Hello, this is the show.

322
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,840
Sorry we missed you.

323
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,120
Yes, hello, Cleve from Berkeley.

324
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,420
Here's your real name, Cleve.

325
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,520
What is your real name?

326
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,860
If you were here, you'd be talking to millions of disgruntled listeners all across Northern California.

327
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,340
Cleve told me of an incident that happened to him the other day.

328
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,640
He was standing in a nearly deserted Boston subway station.

329
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,440
Tell it, brother, tell it.

330
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,260
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.

331
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,160
And he said, what's your name?

332
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,560
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said Bob.

333
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,380
That's right, he said Bob.

334
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,500
And the drunk said...

335
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,400
He said, all the best drunks are named Bob.

336
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,520
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.

337
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,500
And then that man got down on his hands and knees and he licked that third rail.

338
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,700
How many of you listening by radio can lick that third rail?

339
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,780
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to, huh?

340
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,380
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses.

341
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,500
Yes.

342
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,320
Sitting there.

343
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,760
Sitting there.

344
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,400
Praising Bob.

345
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,780
Singing hymns to Bob.

346
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,020
But you're afraid to get out there and...

347
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,040
Whoop, P-Dog for Bob, huh?

348
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,660
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?

349
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, you Californians are so laid back.

350
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,340
We're into violence and hate in Texas.

351
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,700
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.

352
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,340
We thought he was a good guy.

353
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,600
We thought he was, like, on our side.

354
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,100
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him.

355
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,260
Just to praise him.

356
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,240
Now, hey, I didn't get any ammo.

357
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,820
I got some PCP.

358
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,840
And it was in recognition for his efforts in the United States.

359
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Well, you best be glad I didn't get no ammo.

360
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,300
Well, at least that.

361
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,580
There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.

362
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,540
What?

363
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,280
Where am I?

364
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,620
What?

365
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,920
It's the next day and I'm still doing this show.

366
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
It's still the same show.

367
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,940
It's a day later.

368
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
Well, anyway, stop the pressings.

369
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,240
I was about to do this whole other thing.

370
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,040
I had a lot of sermonizing to do.

371
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,000
But we just got a package in the mail from Brother Cleve Duncan.

372
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,360
Our good friend up in Boston, Massachusetts.

373
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,500
Known to our Slack listeners for his many subgenius hymns.

374
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,500
And he sent a CD by this band.

375
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Heard in the background.

376
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
Combustible Edison.

377
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,200
This album called I Swinger.

378
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,760
And Cleve's letter here on lovely Contiki letterhead says,

379
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,720
What did it look like?

380
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,300
It's back to life on the road for me this summer.

381
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,160
Filling in again for another keyboard player who doesn't want to tour.

382
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm trying to do a sort of pathetic imitation of Cleve's Boston accent.

383
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,340
But what better band for me to tour with than the drinking and swinging Combustible Edison.

384
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,540
America's greatest purveyors of cocktail exotica.

385
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,500
Possibly the anti-medicine.

386
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,540
Music of the 90s.

387
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,420
It certainly ticks a lot of people off in much the same way.

388
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Byron Werner has ruined his pants knowing we're coming to his town.

389
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,420
He's throwing a cocktail party for us at his house.

390
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,360
I know Bob will be smiling on us as we tour around America.

391
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,160
AttachÃ© cases full of booze handcuffed to our wrists.

392
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,000
Fighting the conspiracy's dogma of teetotalitarianism every step of the way.

393
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,820
Repent.

394
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,440
Discover the sublime.

395
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,620
The sublime joys of the perfect martini.

396
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm pushing for a Dallas date on this tour.

397
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,660
I hope it happens so we can hook up.

398
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,540
It has been a while hasn't it?

399
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,140
If you want to play any of this on your show and tell people to come out and see us please do.

400
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,200
We'll take all the free publicity we can.

401
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,320
So friends, the Combustible Edison in this case with Brother Cleve Duncan.

402
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,500
Brother Cleve Donut Duncan on keyboards will be in these following days.

403
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,500


404
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,520
In the town where the Hour of Slack is played.

405
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,300
These worthy cities which host this wonderful show.

406
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,760
May 20th in New York City.

407
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,880
I don't know which clubs they are but that's May 20th in New York City.

408
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,900
Thanks to WFMU there.

409
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,060
Let's see.

410
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,280
May 26th in Detroit.

411
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,600
For you Detroit Windsor listeners.

412
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,480
May 27th in Chicago.

413
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,480


414
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,480


415
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,060
Chicago, and I was there last week.

416
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,600
Praise Run and Gun Productions.

417
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,180
More on that later.

418
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,100
May 28th in lovely Madison, Wisconsin,

419
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,600
where the slaves of Sister Velveteen Sly can be heard chanting in the background.

420
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,780
And let's see.

421
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,080
And June 11th and 12th in Los Angeles.

422
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,160
Those are the cities which host not only Combustible Edison,

423
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,080
but also the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

424
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,820
Let's listen in on this new, brand-new CD, shall we?

425
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,400
There's a million, there's a holiday.

426
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,040
Oh, beautiful, amazing, but true.

427
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,000
And now.

428
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh, what else have we here?

429
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,780
Oh, let's see.

430
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:49,580
Along with this Combustible Edison CD came this sort of a proclamation of the cocktail nation, dear friends.

431
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm going to read this to you.

432
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,440
It says here,

433
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,940
Calling all swingers from the penthouse to the doghouse, from the bedroom to the boardroom.

434
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,640
And the

435
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:23,500
We, the citizens of the cocktail nation, a nation defined not by geographical boundaries,

436
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,220
but by a common philosophy and dedication to the principles of the high life and the propagation thereof,

437
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,980
do hereby declare our solidarity and autonomy,

438
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,900
our independence from the desiccated horde of mummified uniformity,

439
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:50,120
our freedom from an existence of abject swinglessness.

440
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,820
Hey, man, this music is abject swinglessness.

441
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Let's flip it over.

442
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,740
I was looking for some kind of cocktail music.

443
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,780
That's a little bit better.

444
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,340
The irregulars of the cocktail nation are blessed with enough uncommon sense to recognize their nature,

445
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:23,680
cultivating not riches, but richness, swankness, suaveness, and strangeness with pleasure and boldness for all.

446
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,020
Into the void of dictated sobriety,

447
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,240
we send this call.

448
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,480
To action.

449
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,420
The first step towards liberation is illumination.

450
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,140
So know your tribe.

451
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,780
The twelve tribes of the cocktail nation are as follows.

452
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,000
And do any of these describe you, dear friend?

453
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,180
The Fabulous.

454
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,520
The Libertinis.

455
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,020
The Clan of the Intoxicado.

456
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,380
The Adventuralites.

457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,060
The Sassanians.

458
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,900
The Tussie Chicks.

459
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,440
The Swinglophiles.

460
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,060
The Terpsichorporationists.

461
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,340
The Grandiloquent Sophisticulturalites.

462
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,800
The Aesthetics.

463
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,420
The Exo...

464
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,840
No, the Exoticants.

465
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,080
I thought it was the Exotoxicants.

466
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,280
The Exoticants.

467
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,840
The High Rollers.

468
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
And the Lords of Leisure.

469
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,180
Know your tribe, friend.

470
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,540
Which is yours?

471
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,200
The citizen of the cocktail nation seeks a deeper appreciation of the finer things in life,

472
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,720
whilst ever striving for elevation in that rarefied stratosphere,

473
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,920
the very lap of Lusbury.

474
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,640
The citizen of the cocktail nation strives at all times to swing in style,

475
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,320
and above all else, to be fabulous.

476
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,100
Be fabulous.

477
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,480
This is the sacred credo of the cocktail nation, fabulousness.

478
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,200
It's not bought with a sacrifice at the altar of Mammon.

479
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,780
Fabulousness is a spiritual extravagance and a glamorous aberration,

480
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,460
larger than life in even the minutest details.

481
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,100
And, you know, friends, this doctrine is the cornerstone of the unification of the cocktail nation.

482
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,580
In all things, please, be fabulous.

483
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:42,640
And in being fabulous, to quote Bob Stupak, the Polish maverick of Las Vegas,

484
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,700
the sky is the limit.

485
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,720
Yes, there's a little more combustible Edison now for us all.

486
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,900
There's a little more.

487
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,520
Yes.

488
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,820
Yes.

489
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,920
Believe in me.

490
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Yes.

491
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,280
Come, forward, andÐ¸Ñ.

492
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,080
, andia.

493
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,520
That's what people's minds runs on

494
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,060
and the morals are breaking down

495
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,400
and that's what it did in the Roman Empire

496
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,300
right before the Roman Empire fell.

497
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,680
Their morals broken down.

498
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,880
Well, there once was a man

499
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,840
The world's greatest salesman

500
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,360
And he had devised a plan

501
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,980
To get the shackles from our feet

502
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,040
To get the shackles from our feet

503
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,780
But now he's gone

504
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
A martyr for the cause

505
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
For this world

506
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,460
And he's coming again

507
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,880
Who knew that the first shot

508
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,020
Was gonna be the last shot

509
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,140
But he's got a hard driving pipe

510
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,580
The gas won't go through the night

511
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,040
So go to sleep

512
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,040


513
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,040


514
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,500
And I don't know

515
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,280
He made me hurt

516
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,920
You know that

517
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,240
Keep on squirting

518
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,540
All this fun

519
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,860
And he's coming again

520
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,620
Yes, dear friends,

521
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,200
and this is Brother Cleve Duncan

522
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,820
with his classic, classic subgenius hymn

523
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,340
Bob is My Load

524
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,460
an amazing piece

525
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
engineered by

526
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,040
Reverend Cleve Duncan

527
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,160
and Dr. Gleapo Abernathy

528
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,680
and I'm pleased with him

529
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,180
and Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

530
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,980
as the chorus

531
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,500
The zombies for Bob Chorus

532
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,460
Ah, yes

533
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,020
It's a pretty strong church we find

534
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,640
and for school

535
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,080
yet we fall short

536
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,240
when it comes to taking care of our own

537
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,540
I'm looking for one new value

538
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,900
I'm looking for one new value

539
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,940
but nothing comes my way

540
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,780
An organization formed to oppose moral majority

541
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,240
How is this part

542
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,760
of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate

543
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,260
and to accept homosexuals as teachers in our Christian school

544
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,820
Our church happens to believe that homosexuality is a sin

545
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,860
Bullseye doesn't watch sniffles with me

546
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,940
Speaking of whores, that was that

547
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,720
And stop trying to force immorality into the law

548
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
which makes people accept it

549
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:28,880


550
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,520
Immorality

551
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,660
Our television programs laugh at homosexuality

552
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,660
Hey, they laugh at immorality

553
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,820
They laugh at ungodliness

554
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,040
They make a mockery of the holy word of God

555
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,340
And God says when you change my truth into a lie

556
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,680
I'll give you up to vile affections

557
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,160
In recent years, a real mystery has grown up around the subject of feminine hygiene

558
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,860
Much of this is due to the fact that women are not allowed to have sex with men

559
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,280
And that's due to advertising of so-called hygiene products

560
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,380
Which make us think that unless the American woman uses a particular deodorant or spray

561
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,700
She is neither clean nor desirable

562
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:21,820
Actually, many products that are being glamorized in today's advertising cause more harm than charm

563
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,860
Doctors agree that feminine hygiene sprays, deodorants, pyrolysis, and other products that are used in the world are not harmful to men

564
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:28,860


565
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:37,000
2000 Comb das in the vaginal area of the vagina

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,240
Many doctors recommend that you have baths over showers.

copy of Bridges of Madison County and read that to you. Talk about porno. Oh, here's

659
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,240
some good porno, dear friends. By the way, this music in the background is the Nurk Twins.

660
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:48,660
I really don't know much about them. I have this cassette from the Nurk Twins and, well,

661
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,940
actually, I could give you their address if you wanted to get this lovely background music.

662
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,620
I'm going to do it quick for those of you with tape recorders only. Nurk Twins, 1970

663
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:13,120
Latham Avenue, number 78, Mountain View, California, 94060. That's the background music.

664
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,200
That's not the Church of the Subgenius address. Anyway, as I was saying, speaking of pornography,

665
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:28,740
here's a piece by a Voodoo Mark band called Fighting by Voodoo Mark and Pink Bob. This is

666
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:37,160
off the FOT Records collection, Past Normal. There's a lot of pressure on us all to have sex,

667
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:44,820
male or female, straight or not so straight. The requirement to be sexually wringing wet

668
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,740
is signaled everywhere from our friends,

669
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:56,000
to the arts and media of our times. We don't measure up, it seems to read, if at some point

670
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,740
in our week we aren't posing like Big Shirtless Rod at some guest jeans ad, or rubbing ourselves

671
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:10,380
like MTV's latest pseudo-prostitute. No one anywhere seems to want to delve into how uncomfortable

672
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:18,320
we can be with this event. To consider my performance, physiology, level of experience,

673
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:27,260
comfort, distress, do I experiment too little, too much? Just what should I do here?

674
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,060
All these micro-thought processes add up to a level of dread on a par with being called

675
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,980
to the blackboard to solve a math problem in seventh grade with a boner.

676
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,780
The end.

677
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,640
End of the second half.

678
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:48,640

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,680
so I'll give them up

685
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:14,820
I've given out some

686
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,480
I japanese

687
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,740
defense, it was not initially my decision. It simply was. But the infrequent sexual events

688
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,880
of the recent past have led me to embrace this decision. Not that the usual 45 seconds

689
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,360
of bone-chilling intercourse was that bad. It was more that cold, clammy feeling I'd

690
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,900
get afterwards. Weeks of plotting, planning, and expecting, leading only to two people

691
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:51,300
shrugging their shoulders mentally and saying to themselves, gee, I wonder what that was

692
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:00,360
all about. So that's it. Stick a fork in me, I'm done. As always, when one door closes

693
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:06,040
in life, another opens. My significant other and I now share a new recreational, interactive

694
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:13,100
pastime. Fighting. You know, hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing things at each other's heads.

695
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,840
Now there's passion.

696
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,220
Not since we were newlyweds have I felt the flames burning brighter in her soul. Not since

697
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,300
our first kiss have her cheeks flushed so red. A complete release of tension, an outpouring

698
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,620
of emotion, intense physical contact. Everything they said sex was, everything sex failed at

699
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:40,280
miserably. And afterwards we collapsed, bent on the floor, assessing the damage, saying

700
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,660
our apologies. She wipes the blood from her mouth and calls me an asshole.

701
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,340
And I say, you weren't too bad yourself. Ouch. Good one.

702
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,900
Oh, and dear friends, that's voodoo.

00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,340
No, it's not.

721
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,320
It was Frank Paul for a second,

722
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,040
but now it's Steve Horowitz and The Code

723
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,880
with this lovely tune,

724
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,300
Wanna Make Something of It.

725
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,240
Once again, from the past normal,

726
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,420
double CD from FOT Records.

727
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,100
Oh, thank you.

728
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,680
Thank you.

729
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,780
Thank you.

730
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,200
As I was saying,

731
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,800
speaking of,

732
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,380
speaking of pornography,

733
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,120
here's a follow-up on a story

734
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,940
that we've been,

735
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,400
we tried to keep you abreast of

736
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,020
on the hour of Slack here.

737
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,860
The story of the woman whose eyes were gouged out.

738
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,040
Many of you may remember this one.

739
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,600
Woman whose eyes were gouged out

740
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,320
doesn't want to prosecute,

741
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,600
lawyer says.

742
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,580
The attorney for two women

743
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,320
accused of gouging out their sister's eyes

744
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,680
has said,

745
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,200
that the charges should be dropped

746
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,740
because the victim does not want to prosecute.

747
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,780
But officials with Dallas County District's office

748
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,320
said Thursday,

749
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,820
they may proceed with the case

750
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,600
regardless of the woman's wishes.

751
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,780
Police allege that Ms. Crawford and Ms. Johnson

752
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,560
gouged Ms. Obazi's eyes out with their fingers

753
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,220
during a prayer ritual

754
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,580
at another woman's Southeast Oak Cliff home.

755
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,760
The homeowner told police that the women,

756
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,900
were trying to drive out the demonic spirit

757
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,460
of Ms. Obazi's father.

758
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,260
I guess the spirit would go with the eyes.

759
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,960
Ms. Crawford and Ms. Johnson were arrested

760
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,560
and indicted last month,

761
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,080
despite an affidavit signed by Ms. Obazi

762
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,580
states she did not wish to press charges.

763
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,940
And, uh,

764
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,240
she claims that she blacked out

765
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,200
and didn't remember,

766
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:14,740
uh,

767
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,180
what happened after her sisters began

768
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,060
poking her eyes.

769
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,660
So she, she doesn't know for sure that they,

770
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,580
they were the ones that gouged them out.

771
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,680
You know, it might have been the spirit

772
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,780
of somebody else's father.

773
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,160
Anyway, um,

774
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,760
Assistant District Attorney George West said,

775
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,580
Ms. Obazi's affidavit gave no reasons

776
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,540
for not wanting to pursue the charges.

777
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,260
He said he might consider dropping the charges,

778
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,640
but wants to make sure first

779
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,300
that relatives didn't coerce Ms. Obazi

780
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,160
to sign the document.

781
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,800
When someone's as helpless as she is

782
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,940
and as emotionally dependent on the family as she is,

783
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,360
you obviously have to look closer at the case,

784
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,440
Mr. West said.

785
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,100
Even if Ms. Obazi made the request of her own free will,

786
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,520
uh, he said,

787
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,240
he may prosecute anyway to deter others

788
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,580
from participating in potentially harmful rituals.

789
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,760
We have to balance the needs of society,

790
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,280
uh, he said, he may prosecute anyway to deter others from participating in potentially harmful rituals. We have to balance the needs of society,

791
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:14,660
we have to balance the needs of society,

792
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,820
with the victim's wishes.

793
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,700
Well, there you go, dear friends.

794
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,140
It's against the law to gouge your own sister's eyeballs out

795
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,480
in the name of Jesus,

796
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,080
which is what this was actually done about.

797
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,360
The Dallas Morning News doesn't like to dwell

798
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,640
on those sorts of unpleasant facts,

799
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,300
but like so many of the smothered and drowned

800
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,340
and scalded babies, it was,

801
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,100
well, the lady was having problems,

802
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,680
and so of course it must have been demons.

803
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,220
And see, to get the demons out,

804
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,300
and bring in Jesus,

805
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,180
it's illegal to gouge out your sister's eyes,

806
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,620
even if she wants you to do that.

807
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,060
For Jesus.

808
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,460
Hey, hey, I don't like the way they're trying to make these laws, friend.

809
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,640
Man, I'll tell you what, it's just,

810
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,520
it seems like the weirdos are,

811
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,820
I mean, the really weirdos,

812
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,860
the dangerous weirdos are outnumbering the harmless weirdos now.

813
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,620
And will you come over,

814
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,520
bringing those long things I like,

815
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,460
those long and slender things over by Bob's place,

816
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,300
the garbage pail,

817
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,360
because I was going to fix and say something about Bob.

818
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,940
That was Bob we were singing about.

819
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,360
I think that was Bob.

820
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,800
If you're talking about your straight Bob,

821
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,000
your righteous Bob,

822
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,640
your true Bob,

823
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,220
your Bob that is there,

824
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,020
and yet, well, I'd still be here,

825
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,780
and so would you.

826
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,480
This is true.

827
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,660
So?

828
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
I guess there's nothing that we can do but sing about Bob.

829
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,180
You know what God says the end result of vile affections is?

830
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,900
He says you're going to become so perverted in your lifestyle, hear me.

831
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,400
You're not simply going to smoke cigarettes

832
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,220
and inject needles into your collapsing veins.

833
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,080
You're not simply going to guzzle down alcohol,

834
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,680
but you're going to be so depraved

835
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,840
that your women are going to begin to make love to women,

836
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,500
and your men are going to begin to make love to women.

837
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,280
Bring that which is totally unnatural.

838
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:28,100
Ex-child star Sally LeRoy, 24, vegetarian, mystic, acid head.

839
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,120
The kid's head while he vomits and retches sitting on a curbstone at 4 o'clock in the morning,

840
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,900
and when his knees get enough starch back in him so he can stand up and empty his pockets,

841
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,380
you can bet he'll turn out a sticker to a marijuana,

842
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,080
and you can double your money.

843
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,480
He'll be holding a gun.

844
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,980
He'll be holding a sugar cube or a cap or two.

845
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,140
So don't you con me with your mind expansion, slop.

846
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,480
I deal with kids every day.

847
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,420
I try to clean up the mess that people like you make out of them.

848
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,660
I'm the expert here.

849
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,440
You're not.

850
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,440
Really?

851
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,760
When's the last time you were asked to appear on television?

852
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,420
I am the new way to go, the way of the future.

853
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,840
I can't begin to fill all my personal appearance requests.

854
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,680
I'm not just news, my friend.

855
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,420
I make news, big news.

856
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,820
Even when my name is gone, I keep my word.

857
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,040
Just pray that God starts aerei the whole way around khÃ´ng .

858
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,840
Look, you sit there thinking you're still rare and desperate,

859
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,960
but don't check your fortune as I said the other day.

860
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,700
Think, think, maybe ...

861
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,700
What the hell is it?

862
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,120
It's-it's horrible, man.

863
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,120


864
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,380
You what?

865
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:48,480
And God has a place for you to fit in to the body of Christ and begin to actively do that.

866
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,160
Whoa, I don't know if I want to fit in to the body of somebody else.

867
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,460
You're going to have to exercise sometimes some guts, some boldness.

868
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:01,860
But nobody can tell you how the Holy Ghost is going to manifest in your life.

869
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,960
It's something that's pure.

870
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,480
It's something that's holy.

871
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:11,000
I can think of the body of somebody I might like to fit into a piece of.

872
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,160
To what?

873
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,900
To one lady.

874
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,220
I said, well, you know, you're a minister.

875
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,180
We're going to make ministers out of members.

876
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,920
And she said, no, no, no, no, no.

877
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,780
We're not ministers.

878
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,400
Now, we might be messengers, but we're not ministers.

879
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,560
Oh, no, no, no, no.

880
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,620
Well, I knew where she was coming from.

881
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,960
And listen, this is common.

882
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,340
We've all grown up in church.

883
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:40,980
Hey, I mean, you know, people see themselves many times as part of the lower class of people.

884
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,400
Christians.

885
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,100
What?

886
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,500
Those who are not full-time, paid ministers.

887
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,720
Talk quite the opposite, my good man.

888
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,260
And I want to tell you, brother and sister, that's not of God.

889
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:56,160
And that will hold back ministry, effective ministry, in our Christian culture.

890
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:03,800
I believe as Christians, as a grass move army of God, we can be much more effective than we are.

891
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,520
I do believe I've looked objectively at the body of Christ in the United States.

892
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,820
And I have to say, it's been fairly.

893
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,540
It's been fairly static.

894
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,580
I don't see the rocket growth that I saw in the beginning of the book of Acts.

895
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,500
But I believe it's possible.

896
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,580
Look at Stephen.

897
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,380
I mean, the Bible says that he did mighty miracles.

898
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,340
But he was just a table waiter.

899
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:35,240
And even the great evangelist Philip was right by Stephen's side, waiting tables in the beginning.

900
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,420
And maybe before I became a preacher, I was a net digger.

901
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,880
Why do they call us?

902
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,800
The lower class of Christian believers.

903
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:50,620
Well, obviously, now the Bible says, if you wait tables, you can move in God's power and do mighty miracles and perform wonderful signs.

904
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,340
And I choose to bring one to the altar because that works.

905
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,060
And God uses that.

906
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,880
However, it's a trap.

907
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,940
Don't worry about any blunders you've made while young.

908
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,460
It's the privilege of youth.

909
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,800
Do you know why the calendar exists?

910
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,220
Do you know what a one-week cycle is?

911
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,180
You have one day of rest with every seven days.

912
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,100
That's rhythm.

913
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,160
One day out of seven days, you can do whatever you like.

914
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,100
You have to have your way sometime.

915
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,400
Jokes and humor are great fun, but won't last.

916
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,960
Just be yourself.

917
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,980
You can't live on promises.

918
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,320
Let's spread our wings.

919
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,220
Laugh, cry, eat, sleep.

920
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,240
That's life.

921
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,220
But let's put a little spice in life.

922
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,460
Don't let people feel sorry for you.

923
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,440
Let's put a little spice in life.

924
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,320
Let's put a little excitement in life.

925
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,320
Tomorrow's hero might be you.

926
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,300
Express yourself and get your word out.

927
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
Life's too serious.

928
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,360
There's not enough humor in the world.

929
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,780
Girls should be aware of the girls.

930
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,260
Boys should be aware of the boys.

931
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,160
And never forget the Naminayoi goals.

932
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,660
Shout aloud.

933
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,480
We're the best dressed in the world.

934
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,140
But shout within you.

935
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,420
Don't push me around.

936
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,240
Until we meet again.

937
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,000
Joke.

938
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,020
Yes.

939
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,500
Yes, dear friends, and that was The Wall Men.

940
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,020
The Wall Men from their new CD.

941
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,160
I can't believe The Wall Men are on a CD.

942
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,720
Their CD, Not Too Long Time Sound.

943
00:58:53,980 --> 00:59:03,240
And you can write The Wall Men at 7711 Lisa Lane.

944
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,400

945

947
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:27,020
Ah, yes, and friends who have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:53,140
A simple self-addressed stamped envelope to Bob.

953
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:03,220
That's right, just address that to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 7530.

954

Thank you.

960
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Thank you.

961
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,040
Thank you.
