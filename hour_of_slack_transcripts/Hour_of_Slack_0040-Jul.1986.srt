1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Open your heart, unzip your pants,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,820
close your mind and bend over

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:13,880
cause you're about to receive the word of Bob.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,280
Do you wanna pour it down?

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,100
Do you wanna pour it down?

6
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,800
Do you wanna pour it?

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,900
Do you wanna pour it?

8
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:13,900


9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:13,900


10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,620
Do you wanna?

11
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,260
Do you wanna pour it up?

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,740
Do you wanna pour it up?

13
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,240
Do you wanna pour it up?

14
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,540
You should love it!

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,240
Oh, yes, dear friends.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,680
We're back.

17
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,700
We're back.

18
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,700
That wonderful hour.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
Friends, that bad hour.

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,380
That one-time hour, friends.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,940
That mysterious hour.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,540
That poltergeist-infested hour.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,860
Friends, the poltergeist is working tonight.

24
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,740
Yes, he's working double time.

25
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,820
Because one of these tape decks won't turn off.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,180
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang.

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,400
You're liable to hurt yourself.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
There you go.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,200
There we go.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,300
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started here, Doctor.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,260
I'm anxious to take off.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,880
Take off.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,320
Oh, wait a minute.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,460
Would you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,820
What'd you do, Doctor?

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,420
There, central control is on, Doctor.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,620
Good, good.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,820
Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,700
Yeah.

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh, watch out for that squid, man.

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,180
There's a prairie squid right by the door.

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,680
What?

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,960
Speaking of which.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,860
And inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the retribution chamber?

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,100
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,460
Well, we really are...

47
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,700
A swine, too, has a prayer request.

48
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,540
Is that so?

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,100
Well, friends...

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,960
Well, tell them to pray.

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,820
That's right.

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,960
They're just going to have to pray, friends, because Pastor Naked ain't here.

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
They've been injected now.

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,900
You know, like last week, we...

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,340
What?

56
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,180
What?

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,680
We had the all-female callers, but...

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,560
And we wouldn't let any tool-using primates call in.

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,660
Tool-bearing primates, I believe is the proper term.

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,160
That's right.

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,800
And tonight, not even the tool-bearing ones...

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,040
Not even the faithful.

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,620
Not even the faithful will talk on the phone tonight, friends.

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,540
No, there's enough motor-mouthing going on here in the control room.

65
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,880
We don't need help from outside, because we've got to talk to you tonight about something...

66
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,620
Very, very important.

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,700
We're talking about conservation of a natural resource, friends.

68
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,420
Yes.

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,160
My dear friends, when was the last time you had you a good old prairie squid, eh?

70
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,440
Yeah, prairie squid.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,220
Now, what sort of evocations does that name bring up to you, friends?

72
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,500
Prairie squid.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
It even makes my microphone pop.

74
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,220
Well, we're going to...

75
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Probably half of our audience doesn't even know...

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,300
What is that?

77
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,040
Half of our audience...

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,780
Our audience has probably never seen...

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,880
Well, you left the airlock open.

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Yeah, that's...

81
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,760
That's what that is.

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,960
Oh, kill the airlock.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,900
Yeah, well...

84
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,480
Okay.

85
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,100
Okay.

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,320
Friends, let me tell you something.

87
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,080
First off...

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
Let's get serious about this, doctor.

89
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,020
First of all...

90
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,840
Cassette deck two...

91
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,280
Is not working.

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,400
And the ports on the starboard side are completely...

93
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,380
That's okay.

94
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,720
We're losing air fast, and we're going to have to try to keep up with it, friends.

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,320
We're all going to have to...

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,840
We're all going to have to...

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,240
We're all going to have to...

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,620
We're all going to have to...

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,620


100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,620


101
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,620


102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,880
Church air over here, doctor.

103
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,720
Ah, yes.

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Have a...

105
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,320
Now I feel considerably better.

106
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,600
Ah, yes.

107
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,820
Have a nice church air.

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,420
Oh, yes.

109
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh, yes.

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,620
Praise God.

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,480
I feel that church air now.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,740
Do you feel it?

113
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,140
I bet you can.

115
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,980
I bet you can.

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,440
Yes.

117
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,700
Reach out and feel it, friends.

118
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,820
And if you can't reach down and feel it, then you're going to...

119
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,300
You probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,300
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

121
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,260
When you were...

122
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:25,020
Now, I know about half our audience, Dr. Gordon, probably remember when they were teenage boys and girls out in, you know, West Texas or wherever they're from, going out in the fields and taking off their clothes and spreading some prairie squid bait all over, you know.

123
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes, yeah.

124
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,880
What did you used to use?

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,920
I used jelly.

126
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,640
Jelly, mostly.

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,540
Yeah, I found...

128
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,640
Honey, whatever I could steal from my folks.

129
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,260
Peanut butter with bananas in it worked real well.

130
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,760
Yeah.

131
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Yeah, I found that with...

132
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,480
And those...

133
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,300
Excuse me, I'm still...

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,240
Those...

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,140
Decompressants and all that trail we're talking.

136
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Squid, would they be...

137
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,340
They'd be crawling out of the woodwork.

138
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,800
Out of the brush.

139
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,240
Out of the weed, so to speak.

140
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,980
You just lay there and wait for them.

141
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,660
And there you were.

142
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,940
And be quiet, because you'd scare them away.

143
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
They're very...

144
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,180
And, you know, it's just...

145
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,620
Just to give you an example.

146
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,740
Just like, do you remember back when you were a kid,

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,100
there were all those thousands of those little cute horny toads around?

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,980
And why do you think they called them horny toads?

149
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,100
Because they counter-exist.

150
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,460
You know, they're part of a symbiotic relationship with that favorite outdoor mollusk of ours.

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes, and dare we say the name again?

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,640
The mighty prairie squid.

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Oh, yes.

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,400
And, of course, as you know, Dr. Stang, I have just come back from a fact-finding tour

155
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,760
through the Amazonas regions of Brazil.

156
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,720
Yes, friends, just to fill you in exactly on what's going on here,

157
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,400
we have as our special guest tonight Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

158
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,340
Yes, indeed.

159
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,820
The erstwhile head of the Green Hill-Dobstown encampment

160
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and now commandant of Dobstown II just outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

161
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,220
Yes, friends, right on the coast where the surf is high and so is everybody else usually.

162
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Exactly.

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,520
And, friends, you know, and this, what you're listening to, dear friends,

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,980
is the hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

165
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,400
Now that the uranium has warmed up, the airlock leak has been stopped,

166
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,180
I think it's about time we launched this show, Doctor.

167
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,640
I can feel the mighty thrust of that show lifting us up higher and higher.

168
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Thrust, yeah.

169
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,220
As Dr. Motherspaugh's beautiful hymn, the Bobcata, plays in the background.

170
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,480
And maybe if I hit this tape deck hard enough.

171
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Hit it hard. Here, wait a minute. Let me shoot it for you, Doctor.

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
Let's go. Hold on.

173
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,100
Please do.

174
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,620
Did it do any good?

175
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,580
I don't think so.

176
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,700
Felt good to me.

177
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,100
Yeah.

178
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,420
Well, look, why don't we just...

179
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,980
Let's kill that deck.

180
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,280
Why don't we just throw it away?

181
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,260
Why don't we just throw it through the plate glass window?

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,640
Okay.

183
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Go ahead.

184
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,220
There it goes, friends.

185
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,880
And...

186
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,380
Well, we're one tape deck short and four cards loose here, but...

188
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
But, friends, this is...

189
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,460
We're going to focus on an endangered species that probably, you know,

190
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,160
half of you who weren't raised in the South probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

191
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,060
Maybe we ought to identify it, you know, just so people will know

192
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,720
who don't know what a prairie squid is, Doctor.

193
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,080
Perhaps we ought to at first sort of, as best we can,

194
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,300
define our terms and say that a prairie squid is really...

195
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,460
It's sort of a physical metaphor for a lot of things,

196
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,640
and it's probably exactly what you think we're talking about.

197
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,040
Well, it's not a metaphor.

198
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,760
It's an endangered species.

199
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes, I know, but...

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,160
That used to live on prairies, and the fact that most of these callers don't even know what a prairie squid is.

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,280
Well, they don't even know what a prairie is.

202
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,440
It's all been covered up with...

203
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Most of them.

204
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,820
...Los Colinas and all that kind of stuff, right?

205
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,520
Yeah.

206
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,180
Well...

207
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,740
Throw this...

208
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah.

209
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,160
Throw this...

210
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,380
Throw this...

211
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


212
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


213
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


214
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


215
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


216
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


217
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,380


218
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,540
At the same time, it is a metaphor for existence, Doug.

219
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
The very struggle of...

220
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,340
Who's Doug?

221
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,240
Of the prairie squid.

222
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,500
Doug, the guy over there.

223
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
The struggle...

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,020
The struggle of the poor...

225
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,460
Now, friends, you know, you do see prairie squids nowadays.

226
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,200
You can go to the supermarket and buy a dead, cellophane-wrapped...

227
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,920
Plucked.

228
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,880
...shaved prairie squid.

229
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,260
Yeah.

230
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,140
I mean, they...

231
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,740
It's shocking.

232
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,340
It's shocking.

233
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,820
To us, to us old-timers, I mean, most of you, you...

234
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,860
That's the only way you're ever going to see it.

235
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,060
They've never seen them alive.

236
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,500
I know.

237
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,260
And a lot of people don't even know that they are actually a wild animal.

238
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,620
And, friends, that's such a waste because, frankly, frankly, what the prairie squid is

239
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,620
best used for is the sexual act, sexual congress.

240
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,760
And I'm, you know, I know this may...

241
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,040
We don't want to offend any radio...

242
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,860
But it's a well-known fact, Dr. Staines.

243
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah, I mean, you can look.

244
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,260
You can look in the encyclopedia under prairie squid.

245
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,720
Under prairie, under squid, sub prairie.

246
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,940
Or subgenius.

247
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,160
Yes.

248
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,980
And it'll say, subgenius, C prairie squid.

249
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,600
Exactly.

250
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,240
And, you know, yes, it is.

251
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,400
That's its best use.

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,580
And some people might find that offensive.

253
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,940
But they're the people that don't like to think about things like that because sometimes

254
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,100
they're not sure how to do things like that.

255
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,520
Or they're afraid that somebody will laugh at them if they said that they did something

256
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,260
like that.

257
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,720
Then they...

258
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
They have to...

259
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,920
Add them a prairie squid or two.

260
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, most of them think the prairie squid is a myth.

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh, yeah.

262
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,800
They get real embarrassed if you talk about a prairie squid in polite society.

263
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,520
The polished ears of the rationalists.

264
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:40,940
Oh, yes.

265
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,020
The modernist...

266
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,080
The politically correct ears of the various groups.

267
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,100
The so-called humanistic.

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,820
Yes.

269
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,480
You know, if they were humanists, if they were really concerned about humanity, they'd

270
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,420
free the prairie squid prisoners.

271
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,480
And they'd quit killing prairie squids and make them...

272
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,280
Make in purses and shoes out of them.

273
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,620
Well, I mean, it's worse than killing whales for dog food, Reverend Stang.

274
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,040
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, at least you're benefiting some canines who would

275
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,820
otherwise not have anything else to eat.

276
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,060
But the very idea of killing and tanning prairie squid and turning them into purses and basketball

277
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,980
shoes...

278
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,000
It's repellent.

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,640
It's repellent to anyone who's really lived with nature.

280
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,920
Anyone who is really a nature-oriented person who's concerned about the environment would,

281
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,240
despite the stigma, despite the embarrassment...

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
They would be proud, Doctor.

283
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,740
They would be proud.

284
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,240
They would be proud.

285
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,260
Nay, they would find it their Bob-born duty...

286
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,520
Duty.

287
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,900
Duty, my dude.

288
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,480
Duty, yes.

289
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,780
To seek out that prairie squid and protect them.

290
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,520
And nurture.

291
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:44,980
I mean...

292
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,900
And nurture that prairie squid.

293
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Oh, look at this.

294
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,980
We got a note here.

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,700
There's an anti-Bob person online, too.

296
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,900
It's probably somebody who doesn't like this show.

297
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,260
Probably doesn't like to think about prairie squid.

298
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,320
They probably don't.

299
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,540
Let's go ahead and give it a try, shall we?

300
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,040
Well, if they've got nerve...

301
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,540
Get that microphone out of your ear, Doctor.

302
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,380
Hello?

303
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,720
Dear friend, can you hear us?

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,400
Nope.

305
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,140
Well, the poltergeists are back in the board again, Doctor.

306
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,480
And I...

307
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,360
Dear friend, are you out there?

308
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
They're blinking.

309
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,400
Sort of.

310
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,020
Ah, yes.

311
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,820
Well, the show that no one can talk to.

312
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,820
That's Reverend Ivan Stang and his little button that will not push.

313
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,500
Friends, I just...

314
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,960
I can't...

315
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,680
We can't do it without Buck.

316
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,020
He's the only person left who understands the technology.

317
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,980
That's why we really don't want to take too many phone calls tonight.

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,880
Is because next week, Reverend Buck Naked will be here at the controls.

319
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,480
And I think it's probably going to be an all-phone call.

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,480


321
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
I think it's going to be a phone show or something like that.

322
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,140
Yeah, it'll be another one of those phony shows.

323
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
And so, uh...

324
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,360
We're not handling too much of the phony work tonight.

325
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,780
But I know just what to do about this.

326
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,760
Instead of any real...

327
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,420
They said it was an anti-Bob...

328
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,660
They all want to be...

329
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,100
There's a common psychosis.

330
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,060
This anti-Messiah complex.

331
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,140
Well, it's the only way you see...

332
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,220
If you get your name in the paper as an anti-Messiah,

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,860
it's in the same size type as if you were the Messiah, you know?

334
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,420
They want to...

335
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,380
They link you to the Messiah by being...

336
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,560
I mean, guys that are saying they're anti-Bobs,

337
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,120
they're just saying that so they can have their name linked with Bob.

338
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,420
You understand?

339
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,300
Exactly.

340
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,660
It's a hate-love relationship.

341
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,180
They know they can't...

342
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,740
They aren't good enough to be Bob or to even serve Bob right.

343
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,060
And they're mostly anti-Squid people.

344
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,560
You know, you see them at these Squid suppression rallies.

345
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah, and...

346
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,220
You know, right...

347
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,600
No right to Squid.

348
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,640
You know, they got the no right to Squid move.

349
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah.

350
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,160
Burning records trying to stamp out Prairie Squid.

351
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,100
And those are the same kind of intolerant people who...

352
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,680
The only way they can react to something is to kill them.

353
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,620
If they don't understand it, they kill it.

354
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,460
They kill...

355
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,640
And if they can't eat it, they make socks or shoes or something like that out of it.

356
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,040
There's people out there that would kill a Playboy magazine

357
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,940
if they saw it crawling around through the bushes like a Prairie Squid.

358
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,340
Especially if they thought it would hurt them.

359
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,640
And since they're good for the same things...

360
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Well, except that, of course, the Playboy magazine,

361
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,520
is by no means a Prairie Squid, Dr. Stang.

362
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,620
I'm sure that you and I know that perhaps a Playboy magazine

363
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,180
might be employed with a Prairie Squid, but certainly no such...

364
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,040
Man, I've never needed a Playboy...

365
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,080
Anything besides just the Squid.

366
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,320
The Squid itself is all one really needs.

367
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,740
Friends, a Prairie Squid, it's like a snail without a shell.

368
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,740
A really large, about a foot long...

369
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,680
They've got a light...

370
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,920
They're differing variations of color of hair and how much hair,

371
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,460
how curly...

372
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,500
Yeah, and where it's distributed,

373
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,180
and whether they're an elongated squid or a small, squamous, flattened-out squid.

374
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,980
And just as a snail is like one just...

375
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,700
It's a pseudopod. It's a big foot.

376
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,120
A Prairie Squid, friends, is a huge erogenous zone.

377
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,260
That's all it is.

378
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,120
A mobile erogenous zone.

379
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,220
And we're not talking about one of them camper conversion kits either.

380
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,320
That's right.

381
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,880
And this isn't some chauvinistic thing,

382
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,460
because I know a lot of country girls...

383
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,140
out there know what we're talking about,

384
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,340
because a Prairie Squid...

385
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,400
Well, it interfaces both ways, right, Doctor?

386
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,180
I mean, that's the beauty.

387
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,860
Without expensive interfaces, you can plug right into this amazing new pest.

388
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,680
I mean, you don't need attachments or rubber washers or anything like that with a...

389
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
It just one serves the entire family.

390
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,080
And back in the old pioneer days,

391
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,920
when they first came across this prairie from little towns up the northeast...

392
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
It was a family thing.

393
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,680
Yeah, sure.

394
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,000
You had the little Prairie Squid cage right there on the back of the covered wagon.

395
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,720
Everybody had them.

396
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
I mean, you nurtured them.

397
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,760
And now they're almost extinct.

398
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,960
Now you could cruise Turtle Creek from one end to the other

399
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,820
and never find an ambulating Prairie Squid.

400
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,860
About five years ago, I saw the first wild Prairie Squid I'd seen since my childhood

401
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,600
running around near Glen Rose, Texas, near the power plant.

402
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,040
So, well, who knows?

403
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,920
Maybe they'll be real big, glowing Prairie Squids in a few years.

404
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,300
Yeah, that's true.

405
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,760
Maybe they'll be mutated Prairie Squids, you know?

406
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,180
I mean...

407
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,820
I mean, other things are changing fast,

408
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,980
and people's social habits are changing,

409
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,880
and perhaps one day, Doctor, perhaps one day,

410
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,120
the squid will...

411
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,140
In Bob's time.

412
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,440
The squid, if Dobbs is willing, will return...

413
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,100
After Bob comes again.

414
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,040
And the squid will.

415
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,640
The... Yes, friends.

416
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,740
Yes, after Bob comes the squid.

417
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,820
But I think...

418
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
I think now it's...

419
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,560
It's time for a phone call.

420
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,100
We'll go ahead and take a phone call here, friends.

421
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,500
But we're not going to answer.

422
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,400
Blue Mouse, call Johnny Normal's conference line.

423
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,420
And you guys let her talk, or she's nice.

424
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
Let her talk, or she's nice.

425
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,900
Okay, we'll be nice if you talk.

426
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,700
Yes, that's right.

427
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,220
Oh, there she is right now.

428
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
All right, let's see what she has to say.

429
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,420
Go ahead.

430
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,300
You don't even know why Rue Mouse...

431
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,760
Oh, no.

432
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,020
Wait a minute.

433
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,640
Oh, no.

434
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,540
I'm sick.

435
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,880
I come in peace, and this happens every damn time you put me on the defensive.

436
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,660
Well, first of all, you're not supposed to say damn.

437
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,640
So let's go...

438
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,500
Let's start that again.

439
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,100
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,340
Hello, you're...

441
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,760
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

442
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,280
Give her a chance.

443
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,200
Okay.

444
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay, here's a chance.

445
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
This is your chance.

446
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,940
If you blow this...

447
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,500
Okay, I want you to know...

448
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,080
You're going to be in debt forever.

449
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,900
I want you to know that you're all on tape as violating the FCC rules,

450
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
so don't be sending people out after me.

451
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,180
I've got tape on you, fool.

452
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,800
Nothing's going to come out of me.

453
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:43,880
It's going to come back on you.

454
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,240
It's going to come back on you.

455
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,260
Dig dog's butt, Johnny.

456
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,060
Nothing will happen to me.

457
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,980
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

458
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,280
You self-righteous hypocrite.

459
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,900
You slug-dabbling...

460
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,420
Hadron of Hastor.

461
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,980
My father is Hadurter.

462
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,640
Hold on.

463
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
You're a self-defiling hypocrite.

464
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm a surfer.

465
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,200
You know, that's what I am.

466
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,960
But I don't want to get into that.

467
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's go to line number one.

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,860
Only three more minutes.

469
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm sorry that that neurotic woman got on the air,

470
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,860
but you know what happens sometimes.

471
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,980
They get past our...

472
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,840
By all means, let's...

473
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,360
We're sorry.

474
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,060
We're sorry.

475
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,960
I just can't believe someone would call in

476
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,800
and have the nerve to say things like that

477
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,700
about Prairie Square.

478
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,140
I know.

479
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,380
Not only that, but they call somebody else's show

480
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,060
using our airtime.

481
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,440
Using...

482
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,600
And our area code, for that matter.

483
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,740
That show that dare not speak,

484
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,240
speak its name.

485
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,780
K-N-O-N.

486
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,960
In Berkeley, out in California.

487
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh, they're hip out there in California.

488
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Oh, yeah, but they...

489
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,140
They're so hip, they've got...

490
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,580
Oh, they've got their crack, so to speak.

491
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,200
Yes, yes.

492
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,400
Their drugs and their wild sex.

493
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,900
But have you ever heard a person

494
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,540
from one of these hot tubbers

495
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,220
talking about a prairie squid, friends?

496
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,900
No, you never have.

497
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,460
Never.

498
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,960
They haven't heard about those...

499
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
They've never heard of it.

500
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,300
Those organic boys with their avocado dips

501
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,720
and everything.

502
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,420
They're city folks.

503
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,160
Yeah, they don't know about prairie squid.

504
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,080
Oh, they know everything.

505
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,180
They know everything.

506
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,560
But they don't know that.

507
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,760
And if you told them,

508
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,200
if you tried to tell them about it,

509
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,480
they'd think, oh, how quaint.

510
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,920
He's talking with his southern accent.

511
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
How folksy that...

512
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,940
Oh, he must be...

513
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,020
He must be near to the earth or something.

514
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,440
Yes.

515
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
Yes, yes.

516
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
But I'm an artist.

517
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,860
I don't have to lower myself to those...

518
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,300
to those demeaning...

519
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,220
I'm involved with such incredibly cerebral machinations

520
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,080
over the...

521
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,380
I'm politically minded.

522
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,720
I don't have to...

523
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,080
...the politically correct aspect of my art

524
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,340
and how it applies to prairie squid...

525
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,200
Yes, I'm not obsessed with...

526
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
...that I don't really have to think about

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,820
the humorous side of these things.

528
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
If there is a humorous side,

529
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,460
because I'm serious.

530
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm from California.

531
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
I don't have to do veiled juvenile humor

532
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,000
guising as some sort of...

533
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,000
of highfaluting environmental concern

534
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,900
citizen satire.

535
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,540
Yes.

536
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,900
I'm not that kind of person.

537
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,580
Oh, no, no, no.

538
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,420
Of course not.

539
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,520
That's what they'll tell you every time.

540
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
That's the line they'll spring on you.

541
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,720
The sophisticated...

542
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,800
The sophisticated line.

543
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,600
The conspiracy is...

544
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,040
Their bourgeois line.

545
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,360
The conspiracy is insidious, friends.

546
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,340
Incredibly, they make you want what they have.

547
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,260
And they make you feel stupid

548
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,660
because you haven't got it.

549
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,660
Yeah, and they make you think it's better

550
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,160
than what you already have.

551
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,040
That way, once they get your attention

552
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,760
directed at what they have,

553
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,940
they can get your slack.

554
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,420
Your slack, friends.

555
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,620
That's right.

556
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,040
And you're a prairie squid, too.

557
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,400
And if as long...

558
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,220
As long as you're the kind of person

559
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,860
that can still...

560
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,740
You know, if you can find one,

561
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
you can go out in the woods

562
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,280
and have a short relationship

563
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,920
with one of these harmless animals...

564
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,940
Or a long relationship.

565
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,980
I mean, you know, like...

566
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,860
It's not...

567
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,180
There's no limited time.

568
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,820
The tantric sex magicians in India

569
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,340
and the ancient cultures of the Earth

570
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,460
have known of...

571
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,140
I mean, these are...

572
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,720
These creatures are not just common

573
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,300
to the continental U.S.

574
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,760
That's right.

575
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,680
And Reverend Stang,

576
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,860
I don't know if you know it or not,

577
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,880
but in Tibet,

578
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,800
they breed in the temples

579
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,100
a special variety.

580
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,420
Oh, the fattened special prairie...

581
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,760
The special prairie squid.

582
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
The soft squid, they call it.

583
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, it's the one

584
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
that the Dalai Lama has.

585
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,180
Uh-huh.

586
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,860
And they still breed them there.

587
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,320
Those things eat...

588
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,480
And they have to ship them out to India

589
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,020
where the Dalai Lama is now.

590
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,300
You know, the Chinese let them

591
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,840
because...

592
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,060
They're better fed

593
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,080
than almost anyone in Tibet.

594
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,980
They're better fed...

595
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,420
Any human being.

596
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,000
They're better fed

597
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
than most of Tibet put together.

598
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,000
And, uh...

599
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,360
And, friends,

600
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,280
when you become a member

601
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,860
of the Chinese church,

602
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,760
of the subgenius,

603
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,580
you become eligible.

604
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,540
Yes.

605
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,340
Eligible, friends.

606
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,140
We'll give you

607
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,020
your very own

608
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,640
prairie squid direction

609
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,140
and survival package.

610
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,400
Give yourself

611
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
to the feeling, friends.

612
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,700
Remember to write

613
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,500
for information.

614
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,520
We don't want...

615
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,200
We don't want you

616
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,800
to send money.

617
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,720
We want you to send

618
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,620
your whole wallet.

619
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,340
That's right.

620
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,400
You can take the money out.

621
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
Just send us the rest,

622
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,080
especially those...

623
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,160
those little pictures

624
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,800
that you keep

625
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
in the secret compartment

626
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,580
that you don't show anybody.

627
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,340
We'll take the credit cards

628
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,000
and things, too.

629
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,580
Well, we'll take those.

630
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,640
But those little pictures

631
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
that no one else knows about,

632
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,840
that's what...

633
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,040
The Bob already knows

634
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,620
about those.

635
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
And we can judge

636
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,900
just how...

637
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,300
how...

638
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,200
how highly to rank you

639
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,420
in the great hierarchy

640
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,920
of this church.

641
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,640
And Bob collects them, too,

642
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,320
we might add.

643
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,540
And the better ones...

644
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,300
The better the pictures

645
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,280
that come out of that

646
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,200
little tiny secret

647
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
embarrassing compartment

648
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,900
in your wallet,

649
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,340
the higher up

650
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,100
the rungs you move.

651
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,080
Yes, friends.

652
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,460
And we also found

653
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,160
that one person

654
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,320
who sent his wallet in

655
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,160
had a picture

656
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,440
of a prairie squid in it

657
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,560
and didn't even know

658
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,480
what it was.

659
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,660
He thought it was

660
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
some curious...

661
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,720
He thought it was

662
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,500
some curious

663
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,060
little...

664
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,360
little life form

665
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,260
or...

666
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,100
or a blow-up

667
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,780
of a bacteria

668
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,460
or something.

669
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,640
And he'd been carrying it

670
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,320
around for years

671
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,940
because he felt

672
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,640
it gave him good luck.

673
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,740
And it did.

674
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,600
It did.

675
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,220
It gave him

676
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
incredible good luck

677
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,360
because it brought him

678
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,100
to Bob.

679
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,800
And you see

680
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,760
that just a picture

681
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,540
of a little thing

682
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,380
like a prairie squid

683
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,140
can set you

684
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,420
on the right path.

685
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,920
It'll put you right.

686
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,880
The path to Dobbs

687
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,440
and South.

688
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,280
Bob loves you.

689
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,840
Praise Bob.

690
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,740
Bob loves you.

691
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,500
Bob loves you.

692
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,260
Bob loves you.

693
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,860
Bob loves you.

694
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:05,880
Bob loves you.

695
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:05,920
Bob loves you.

696
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,100
Bob loves you.

697
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,420
Bob loves you.

698
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,580
Bob loves you.

699
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:06,900
Bob loves you.

700
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:06,900


701
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,080
And, you know,

702
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,600
if you could just

703
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,160
let go of those hang-ups

704
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
that have kept you...

705
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,900
that have kept you

706
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,120
tied down, friends.

707
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,780
You could...

708
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,900
Shackled by your own insecurities

709
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,000
was they might say,

710
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,880
Reverend Stang.

711
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,240
You know?

712
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,040
ignorance, your pathetic

713
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,100
ignorance. Your pathetic pink

714
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,900
ignorance is what it is.

715
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,200
Your ignorance of the subgenius

716
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,220
P.O. box number, which we were about

717
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,340
to forget to give. Oh, can we

718
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,320
do that? You bet we can. We have to.

719
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,260
Oh, well, in that case... Bob said we

720
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,280
had to party. Yes, well, that box

721
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,380
number... Why are you sitting there listening to this

722
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,120
radio show? Why aren't you out

723
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,180
partying? Bob said to

724
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,260
party. Party!

725
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,260
Bob said you had to party.

726
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,700
He didn't say you could. You had to party.

727
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
You better party. He didn't say you might

728
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,700
if you felt like it. Yes, indeed,

729
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
French. He said to get out there. Where's that

730
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,620
dirt? We want Bob says

731
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,360
to get out there and do it.

732
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,940
Bob says

733
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
find the squid.

734
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,960
Yes, friends.

735
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,480
Let's bring those squids back. Well,

736
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,540
well, well, in the meantime, we'll just

737
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,100
step back.

738
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,420
Someone said to Barry McGuire,

739
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,760
you're all the same.

740
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,740
You've all been brainwashed.

741
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,080
And Barry thought for a

742
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,680
moment, he said,

743
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
yes, that's true.

744
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,880
But you sinners have been brainwashed

745
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,860
also. The only

746
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,940
difference between you sinners and us Christians

747
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,560
is that us Christians,

748
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,080
we have chosen

749
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,820
to wash our brains.

750
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,980
That's a little rough.

751
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,780
And that doesn't sound

752
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,840
too good to the polished ears

753
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,300
of the liberals and the modernists.

754
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,960
So they soften it

755
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,000
down, you see.

756
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,400
And of course, they would read that verse.

757
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,700
Let God be true in every man.

758
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,300
Be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance,

759
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,640
in my opinion, they say.

760
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

761
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,860
Yeah. But the Bible says, let God be true

762
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,100
and let every man be a liar.

763
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,320
Now,

764
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,560
to make these Christians into a political force,

765
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,360
they don't want us involved.

766
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Let's tell them we're not listening to them anymore.

767
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,060
We're going to be involved.

768
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,120
It isn't going to take Ronald Reagan three years to learn about the godless, aggressive nature of communism.

769
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,740
Over the last two or three decades,

770
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:45,520
the federal government seems to have forgotten both that old time religion and that old time constitution.

771
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,560
I'm a little scared.

772
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:48,880
Now,

773
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
I'm going to tell you a story.

774
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,420
It's been a long time.

775
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,480
It's been 1984 since 1953, friends.

776
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,320
That's right.

777
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,480
That was probably the last time your parents told you about Perry's good.

778
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,020
After that, you know, there was a law.

779
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,100
Yeah, that you weren't even allowed to talk about it until the same law.

780
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,780
J Edgar Hoover passed on.

781
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,800
There was a law.

782
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,260
There's a law, friends on the books.

783
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,620
It says it says this.

784
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,340
No subgenius can do anything.

785
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,260
It wants.

786
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
Now, is this a free country?

787
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,800
Yeah.

788
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,940
When they, when they try to repressive.

789
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,180
I mean, now they they talk.

790
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,560
Oh, America, home of the free land of the brave.

791
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,500
Brave, brave enough to are they brave enough to talk about prairie squid?

792
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,620
Oh, no, no, no, no.

793
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,620
And they talk about can they talk about those two dogs we know of?

794
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,540
Oh, no, no.

795
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,460
Can't talk about them either.

796
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,000
But.

797
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,340
Yeah.

798
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,500
You know, and they're saying, oh, well, it's a land where we have free discussions.

799
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:52,980
Yeah.

800
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,820
But it's a democracy.

801
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,980
But you can only launch a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on a Thursday night.

802
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
And they say, and not if it's a public holiday.

803
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,860
Yeah.

804
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:13,300
They got a golfer head can only be launched on on Thursdays in your own, you know, in the in the in the home of a consenting person.

805
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,400
You can't just go next door to your neighbors and launch ahead.

806
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,160
And the odds forbid you launch ahead in public like downtown on the.

807
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,940
The main square or something like that.

808
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,640
Friends, I want.

809
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,360
North Little Rock.

810
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,580
You find yourself in trouble with the county law, boy.

811
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:25,900
Yeah.

812
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,760
That you can tell them.

813
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,480
You can tell them.

814
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, but officer like doctors for Bob did.

815
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,240
You can say officer.

816
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,860
But but but I'm a bold surrealist, sir.

817
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,980
I'm a bold surrealist.

818
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,340
Oh, yeah.

819
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,740
Oh, yeah.

820
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,380
We got bold surrealist.

821
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:47,300
We got we got 40 men hanging them from telephone poles up in Tucker that like to say they were as bold surrealists.

822
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,220
Yes, friend.

823
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,660
Yeah.

824
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:48,760
Yeah.

825
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,420
Oh, they'll.

826
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, yeah.

827
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,660
They'll tell you.

828
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,260
Kind of head.

829
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,780
Yeah.

830
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,080
They'll launch a sneed head.

831
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,880
Oh, yeah.

832
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,880
They'll they'll launch a Trevino forearm.

833
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,620
If you want.

834
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,180
Be careful.

835
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,680
Green straps the whole time.

836
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,720
The whole time.

837
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,260
Friends.

838
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,220
Friends, I want you to listen to this tape and I want you to meditate.

839
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,740
Meditate on this.

840
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,620
Moseurize and think about Prairie Squid and listen to this tape.

841
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,000
That's true.

842
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
They did.

843
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,320
But the head moved up or down.

844
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,480
And I can recall not too long ago, my father.

845
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:17,720
Uh.

846
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,980
Said to me while playing around at home, you're moving your head.

847
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,220
And I said, I don't think so.

848
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,820
I said, I'm keeping my eye on the ball.

849
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,040
And he said, well, you're keeping your eye on the ball.

850
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,320
Yes.

851
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,400
But your head is moving up and down.

852
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,660
Which I had worked into this unconsciously.

853
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,560
See Arnold Palmer unconsciously knew that his.

854
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,000
I realized.

855
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
And you his head had to be launched.

856
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,100
Yeah.

857
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,980
But that's not the real.

858
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,260
That's not the Arnold Palmer.

859
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,600
That you're thinking of friend.

860
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,200
No, no, no.

861
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,900
You're just not the guy that drives a tractor.

862
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,680
Uh, uh, uh, uh, no, no.

863
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,580
It's not the guy who sells, you know, oil based petroleum products.

864
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,060
This is, this is the, oh, forget it.

865
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,740
You don't even want it.

866
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,300
There's no way.

867
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,820
There's no way they can understand it.

868
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,140
Just, just right to that box number.

869
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,420
Yeah.

870
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,740
That box number friends for the church of the subgenius.

871
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,140
And we'll send you plenty of information about Prairie squids, golfer, head launch in slack,

872
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,780
slack, how to make.

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,380
And Reverend staying.

874
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,800
Uh.

875
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,760
You know, the good, the good sex for mutants dating league, I believe, you know, that's

876
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:22,980
right.

877
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,220
Yeah.

878
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,460
We, that's another church service since.

879
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,120
Yeah.

880
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,840
Since Buck sold the good sex for mutants dating league.

881
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,260
Well, he had to, he was just getting worn out.

882
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,340
You know what he sold it for?

883
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
It was, it was getting worn out.

884
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,620
It was wearing him out.

885
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,500
But you know, uh, you know what he sold him for?

886
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:37,980
All them hot mutants coming.

887
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,380
You know what he sold the franchise for?

888
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,540
No.

889
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,740
What did he sell a franchise for?

890
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,500
A bottle of ripple.

891
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,080
Well, that seems to be value received for value given.

892
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,920
If you ask me.

893
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,940
You can write to P.O.

894
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,680
Box one four oh three oh six in Dallas, Texas, seven five two one four.

895
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,540
You can get information and you don't have to send money.

896
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,160
You'll get lots of printed information.

897
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,000
It'll tell you where to write the good sex for mutants, uh, in salt lake city.

898
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,180
We'll send you, we'll send you the little maps of the, uh, of, of the, the, the known

899
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,940
existing Prairie squid wildlife refuges in your area.

900
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,900
If there are any, if you're fortunate enough to live.

901
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,860
In a part of the country where there are still a few of these precious creatures left where

902
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,900
they're still legal.

903
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,380
Yeah.

904
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,480
Well, they're not.

905
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,840
Oh, Dr. Dool, you just got back from the mutant, uh, beauty contest at the good sex.

906
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,040
I was one of the judges at the good sex for mutants, uh, dating league first annual, uh,

907
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,080
beauty contest in salt lake city just 10 days ago.

908
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,260
A Reverend Stan, those lovely, how were those lovely and disgusting subjeans?

909
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,360
They were, they were some of the most beautifully disgusting.

910
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,580
Mutated sickly creatures that I have ever seen.

911
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,620
Beautiful mutants.

912
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,440
And, uh, there was actually a close runner up.

913
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,120
She was voted miss.

914
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:06,000
Well, we think she was voted miss congeniality was actually a mutated variation of Prairie

915
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,300
squid.

916
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,080
Praise Bob.

917
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,320
Praise Bob.

918
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,140
And it was the biggest, the biggest Prairie squid that I have ever seen.

919
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,140
I say it was about 110 pounds.

920
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,340


921
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,560
Prairie squid.

922
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,340
And friends, if you just tuned in late, if you just tuned in late, you're listening to

923
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:29,180
the hour of slack on KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas, the, the vocal organ, so to speak of

924
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,220
the church of the subgenius.

925
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,300
And we are serious.

926
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:39,880
You really can write to us at get that pencil P O box one four Oh three Oh six here in Dallas

927
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,120
seven five two one four.

928
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,780
And uh, and we'll tell you about that good sex for mutants league.

929
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,420
It really is.

930
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,040
It really is a dating service for mutants.

931
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,380
Various minority cults like the Christians have their own special dating service.

932
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,340
God, I forgot to bring the questionnaire for that.

933
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,280
I was going to read it over.

934
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
It is hilarious.

935
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,960
Um, but, uh, and so we've got our own mutant dating service friends, and this is a church

936
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,820
for mutants.

937
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,440
This is a church for people who the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing

938
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,620
in common with the.

939
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,400
Constipation.

940
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


941
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


942
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


943
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


944
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


945
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


946
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,400


947
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,080
Friends.

948
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,340
And you know about the conspiracy and if you don't, then you're not a subgenius.

949
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
That's why that's it.

950
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,840
And they want to owe half of them out there that send us their, you know, membership,

951
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,060
love offering and get the magazines and the tapes, uh, and so forth.

952
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,100
They, uh, half of them out there aren't really subgenial at all.

953
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,100
Listen to those phones.

954
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,660
They're pathetically trying to reach us.

955
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,300
They have things they have to tell us.

956
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,020
They want to be healed.

957
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,400
They want to be healed.

958
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,840
They hate us.

959
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,180
They want to, they hate us.

960
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,000
They want to kill us.

961
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,980
They want to love us.

962
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,520
They want to ask us how we do it.

963
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,640
And mostly they want us to loan them money, which is, uh, and they want us to shut up

964
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,220
about prairie squid cause they're not going to embarrassed.

965
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,340
Oh, they turn.

966
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,680
So this is the prairie squid show tonight and we're dedicating, we are taking this valuable

967
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:11,420
church time to inform you about this very, very, very clear and present danger.

968
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
That is to say the extinction of the prairie squid.

969
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,340
Prespo, Prespo.

970
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,260
Oh yes.

971
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,840
Dear friends.

972
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,240
This is the beach, the Chinese subgenius.

973
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,080
And you are listening to the hour of slack on K and O M in Dallas, Texas.

974
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,660
Oh yes.

975
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,900
It's so true.

976
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,500
Thank you.

977
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,100
Lee Jing.

978
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,480
I got a call from China just this morning in the hot tub.

979
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


980
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


981
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


982
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


983
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


984
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


985
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


986
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


987
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


988
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


989
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


990
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


991
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


992
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


993
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,480


994
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm going to call the high priestess of all Asia.

995
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,700
You know, when friends, if you had joined up, if you'd been the first person on your

996
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,160
continent to join up with the church, you'd be the Pope of this continent.

997
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,900
I know they, they Dr. G Gordon, Gordon, the Pope of South America, the entire continent

998
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,600
of South America.

999
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,600
And when those soul are the harvest friends, when we start collecting those souls, you

1000
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:15,440
know, who's going to get to skim to skim that fine, fine layer off the top, out of the,

1001
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,940
the soul rendering vat.

1002
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,820
Don't you friend?

1003
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,620
Oh, and they're trying to keep them from selling any kind of soul down there nowadays.

1004
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,220
Oh yeah.

1005
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,720
They, they, they don't used to be in the old days.

1006
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,580
You couldn't give it away and now it's against the law to sell it.

1007
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,500
So what are you going to do?

1008
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,820
And then all the religions want to have your soul friends.

1009
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,240
Bob wants your soul, but just temporarily he'll give it back after he's done.

1010
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,020
He only uses it a little bit while he's got it friends.

1011
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,280
That's something to think about.

1012
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,300
He doesn't dry out.

1013
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,160
That's right.

1014
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Friends as Jane or hyper cleats, uh, uh, the, the, uh, the trance spouter of all time,

1015
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,460
Jane or hyper cleats and little rock Arkansas once said they, they said my mind was in this

1016
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,520
jar and then they poured it down a sink.

1017
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,800
I want you to think about that friends and Dr. Gordon, shall we go to the swing and love

1018
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,240
corpses?

1019
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,540
This isn't their brand new album that just came out.

1020
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,240
It does have a, it does have a beautiful song about Prairie squid, right?

1021
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,140
In the middle of it somewhere.

1022
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,460
I just remember exactly which, uh, why don't we go ahead and roll that?

1023
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,520
And I've got the small Prairie squid right here and we'll take a little, little while

1024
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,300
the music's playing.

1025
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,520
This is a swing and love courses, friends.

1026
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,880
Dr. Philo.

1027
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,700
Dr. Philo.

1028
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:31,880
Dr. Philo.

1029
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,420
Dr. Philo.

1030
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,840
Dr. Philo.

1031
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,020
Dr. Philo.

1032
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,340
Dr. Philo.

1033
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,380
Dr. Philo.

1034
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,380


1035
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,240
Dr. Philo.

1036
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,520
Dr. Philo.

1037
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:35,960
Dr. Philo.

1038
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,580
Dr. Philo.

1039
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,480
Dr. Philo.

1040
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,860
Dr. Philo.

1041
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,700
Dr. Philo.

1042
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,700
Dr. Philo.

1043
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,120
Dr. Philo.

1044
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:00,860
Dr. Philo.

1045
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,760
Dr. Philo.

1046
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:01,960
Dr. Philo.

1047
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Great song.

1048
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,180
Great souls.

1049
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,260
Great things.

1050
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,260


1051
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,320
Thank you.

1052
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,340


1053
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,340


1054
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,660
No, I don't want to suffer.

1055
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,880
Poor crazy pony.

1056
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,140
She couldn't stop lunatic room.

1057
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,980
She couldn't stop lunatic room.

1058
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,120
Poor crazy pony.

1059
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,140
Poor crazy pony.

1060
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,140
No, I don't want to suffer.

1061
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,620
No, no, she suffered.

1062
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,600
So, as the sarcomeres contract,

1063
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,800
thin filaments from the opposite ends of a sarcomere,

1064
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,200
that is, the filaments extending from different Z disks,

1065
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,020
meet at the center of the sarcomere when it's about two micrometers long.

1066
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,100
As the sarcomere contracts,

1067
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,260
as the sarcomere contracts further,

1068
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,340
thin filaments from different Z disks

1069
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,280
begin to overlap within the lattice of thick filaments.

1070
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,560
The latticework of filaments becomes crowded in such a double overlap state,

1071
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,020
and the sarcomere expands laterally.

1072
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,340
Its cylindrical shape increases in girth.

1073
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,160
This lateral expansion stretches the Z disks and other lateral...

1074
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,180
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

1075
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,880
He's a maniac, out to rule the world.

1076
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,080
What can I do to make you understand him?

1077
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,060
I love you.

1078
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,580
Flying saucers, man.

1079
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,060
No!

1080
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,140
Cut!

1081
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I won't왔

1082
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I will only your wish.

1083
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,340
I will only your wish.

1084
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,380
I'll cut the cai Body of Heaven inanguished

1085
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
And phrases

1086
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,800
Like

1087
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,260
No!

1088
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:57,720


1089
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,520
No!

1090
00:37:59,580 --> 00:37:59,940
No!

1091
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,780
No!

1092
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,340
No!

1093
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,500
There is now increasing evidence that the connective tissue surrounding the individual muscle cells,

1094
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,940
as well as the tissue linking the cells, also plays a role.

1095
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,820
And I think that about sums up how the prairie squid actually moves, Doctor.

1096
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:53,760
I'm sure, I'm very sure that our audience has been finally, finally so glad to know,

1097
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,060
or at least feel like they can go out into the street and feel cool again.

1098
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,420
Knowing about, you know, how they work, right?

1099
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,900
Yeah.

1100
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,460
Yeah, that's what it's all about.

1101
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:09,920
Chicago's youngest mother, an unnamed girl, at the age of 10 years and 8 months,

1102
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,780
gave birth naturally in Chicago.

1103
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,540
This is the second youngest in the United States when she was delivered of a 6-pound, 4-ounce girl.

1104
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,480
Now, friends, you know, at the same time, he described it as pterodactyl-like.

1105
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,160
It had a Brahma bull type of hump on the back, like a pelican's pouch at its throat,

1106
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,680
and a 5- to 6-foot wingspan.

1107
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,440
Not with feathers.

1108
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,500
This was a reptilian thing.

1109
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,920
And it was seen by a paramedic who worked...

1110
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,200
This is for the Harlingen, Texas Emergency Medical Center.

1111
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,040
While I was down there on the river and this big bird came down, man, it was tremendous.

1112
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes, big bird is back.

1113
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,780
Probably hunting prairie squid along the edges of the Rio Grande River.

1114
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,960
And, friends, somewhere at the edge of your mind is a sort of a tiny cluster of memories

1115
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,580
that date back to human prehistory, to a time when every man, or in those days, they weren't men at all.

1116
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,520
They were yetis.

1117
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,120
Yes.

1118
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,940
And the women, even the women, were yetis, too.

1119
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:22,220
And in those days, friend, the prairie squid didn't have to live among horny toads to stay stimulated.

1120
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,980
It was able to, let us say, converse physically with the yetis at any time that they wished.

1121
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,100
You know, the yetis, friends, your ancestors, those of you who are true subgeniuses.

1122
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,700
Except for that one variety of self-stimulating prairie squid.

1123
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:39,920
Yes.

1124
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,380
Doctor, which, as you know, became extinct in the late devouring period, I think it was.

1125
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,700
Yeah, well, that was, there was, yeah, but that was long after the yetis were extinct themselves,

1126
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,580
and that's probably what killed them off.

1127
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,820
Now, I'm holding in my hand here a book titled Things You Never Knew Existed.

1128
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,180
A very forthright compendium, friends, one might say.

1129
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,640
And right here on page 44, there it is.

1130
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,460
Squid.

1131
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,660
Comma.

1132
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,600
Prairie.

1133
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,580
And there is an entire summation.

1134
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,740
Now, you can get this information on this prairie squid by merely writing to the Church of the Subgenius.

1135
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,780
That's right, friend.

1136
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,180
And if Reverend Stang would be so kind as to give him that sacred box number really quick one more time,

1137
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,300
and I believe we'll, uh, we might get a guest telephone caller as their lights are still on.

1138
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,120
Well, no, it looks like he's drifted off again, Doctor.

1139
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,380
Oh, we'll, we'll get one.

1140
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:36,960
We'll get one.

1141
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,860
Friends, that address to write to.

1142
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,720
For more information.

1143
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,460
About J.R. Bob Dobbs, the only, only individual who could save your soul and then give it back to you again.

1144
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,380
That address for Bob is Subgenius Foundation.

1145
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:59,860
P.O. Box 140306, dear friend.

1146
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,400
In Dallas, Texas.

1147
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,080
75214.

1148
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,680
And, uh, oh, friends, you don't know what.

1149
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,460
What?

1150
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,480
You don't know what, what could be coming your way in the mail once you sign up with this amazing church with your free information.

1151
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,680
Uh, that you can find out the inside story on not, not just things like prairie squid.

1152
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,200
You can find out why you've been losing at the races and how to start winning again.

1153
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,760
You can find out.

1154
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,180
How come you didn't get that big raise at your conspiracy job that you're nailed to?

1155
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,160
How come that special date with her didn't work out?

1156
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,360
And remember.

1157
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,640
Remember that first time you found you couldn't do it for the second time.

1158
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,400
Yes, friends.

1159
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,660
That's the only almost as scary as the second time you find that you can't do it for the first time.

1160
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,840
It's scary friends.

1161
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,280
It's a scary, scary world out there.

1162
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,800
People.

1163
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,260
You won't have to see what you can do.

1164
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,560
You won't have these problems if you just let Bob solve them for you.

1165
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,940
Get right with Dobbs.

1166
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,540
Get right with Bob into your life.

1167
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,900
Let Bob into your heart.

1168
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,800
You need Bob.

1169
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,980
You have to have Bob.

1170
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
You have to have.

1171
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,700
You better have him.

1172
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:19,800
You know, because I'll tell you, friends, when those have it, because when those end times come down, if you're not right with Bob, you're gonna fry.

1173
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,160
And you'll probably deserve it.

1174
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,940
You will.

1175
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,040
You wish you could die.

1176
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,580
Friends, you'll wish you could die.

1177
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,460
But it'll be worse.

1178
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,800
Bobby, he won't let you.

1179
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,960
He won't let you die.

1180
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,980
You'll be going, Bob, kill me.

1181
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,160
Give me a car.

1182
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,060
Please, Bob.

1183
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,340
You didn't tell me the end times is going to be worse than a Sidney Sheldon miniseries on TV.

1184
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,640
Me.

1185
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,420
Friends, we're going to take that collar right now.

1186
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,680
Where are we going to take it to?

1187
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,180
Because our laboratory continues to be shaken under these conditions.

1188
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,820
Squick.

1189
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,560
Squick.

1190
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,080
It's been a long time since we were trapped by the line.

1191
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,680
That's a squid ick for the uninitiated.

1192
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,360
Yes, this is the show that continues to be trapped by the tiny corners.

1193
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,060
An icky squid is a sticky squid.

1194
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,740
We are forced to listen to you.

1195
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,480
We always used to say at the academy.

1196
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,120
That's right.

1197
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,900
An icky squid is one that's actually icky.

1198
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,100
And if you were just a collar, you're now listening.

1199
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,500
What is ick theology?

1200
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,740
What is your wick?

1201
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,120
It won't make any sense.

1202
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,780
It's a giant ickthyosaur.

1203
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,000
No, you're asleep right now, and this is the ugly show.

1204
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,020
Is that a squid?

1205
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,800
It's all over northern central California at this hour.

1206
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,320
And even people in the building refuse to listen to it.

1207
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,260
Well, let's hear what that other collar has to say.

1208
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,140
Okay.

1209
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,780
Oh, he's calling another collar to see what he has to say.

1210
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,800
He's calling another collar.

1211
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,600
It's a chain reaction.

1212
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,300
Call callers and find out what they have to say.

1213
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,080
The last person who broke the chain, something terrible happened.

1214
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,800
So don't do it.

1215
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,660
Do what it says and call the next collar.

1216
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,600
Call a collar now.

1217
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,620
The last collar.

1218
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,740
Disintegrated two U-quarks, a D-quark, and three pybasins.

1219
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,180
Now, you can't.

1220
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,940
Go ahead.

1221
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,340
Go ahead.

1222
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,260
We let you speak if you're real.

1223
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,420
I think all them three collars just pick up the phone and dial in.

1224
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,240
They've been called.

1225
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,340
There you go.

1226
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:54,500
See?

1227
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:54,800
Yeah.

1228
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,480
Somebody else.

1229
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,720
Tell us about your basketball game down there at Santa Fe School with all the eight-year-olds today.

1230
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,720
Tell us about that.

1231
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:00,840


1232
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,200
Squid.

1233
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,260
They talk about squid.

1234
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,940
They talk about squid out there.

1235
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,760
Yeah, they can talk.

1236
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,540
They like to act like people who know what a prairie.

1237
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,240
Squid is.

1238
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,560
But anybody who called in icky squid.

1239
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,620
Because they heard about it for months, frankly.

1240
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,820
Yeah, of course.

1241
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,080
I'll just throw these little wellmen down there.

1242
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:16,540
Yeah.

1243
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,060
Yes, that was one of the Hour of Slack shows out there.

1244
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,800
Actually, that one's not.

1245
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,300
That predates the Hour of Slack.

1246
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,060
That's the more than an hour, less than a show show.

1247
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,420
It's kind of a cut show, if you know what I mean.

1248
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:38,720
But there's also, we just last week, a new Hour of Slack started up in Boston at the radio station with the MLS.

1249
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:38,920
It's a great show.

1250
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:38,920


1251
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,320
We have a lot of people coming up on the MIT campus.

1252
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,000
They're praising Bob, Dr. Bleepo Abernathy, and Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger of the Church of Mr. Science.

1253
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,260
Praise Bob.

1254
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,300
Praise Bob.

1255
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,940
Some of you out there are lucky enough to be in correspondence with these individuals.

1256
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,640
And we'll be playing some of their variation.

1257
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,440
It's different.

1258
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,420
It's a Yankee kind of thing.

1259
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,640
But up in Boston, you know, they're a wild bunch.

1260
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,140
There's some subgeni up there.

1261
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,160
Feisty, feisty.

1262
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,740
They're dangerous up there, Doctor.

1263
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,520
They have to be.

1264
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,080
They have to be because the audience is in Boston.

1265
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,080
I have stood in front of, it was like the Alamo Friends, that time at the Spit Club, DeVival in Boston.

1266
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,740
You know, we travel around and do DeVivals in other towns, not Dallas.

1267
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,340
Dallas apparently isn't ready for, they want to call us a comedy act.

1268
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,080
An act.

1269
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,740
A joke.

1270
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,080
An act.

1271
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,220
A joke, they said.

1272
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,660
Uh-huh.

1273
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,360
They said it was a joke.

1274
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,100
If that's an act, then those five people who left that club spit in Boston without any legs ought to get,

1275
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,420
an Academy Award.

1276
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,240
Yes, friends.

1277
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,520
Copyrighted by DVD, 6J, or Hyper-V.

1278
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,940
And, friends, I want you to think about, let's go to some, I haven't played this version of one of Buck's songs in a long time.

1279
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,480
This is Onan.

1280
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,240
Well, as Pastor Naked cannot be with us tonight, I think it's only proper that we.

1281
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,680
That we not play his version.

1282
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,780
That we not play his version.

1283
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,220
But, Onan's, and here, somewhere in here.

1284
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,280
Ah, yes.

1285
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,120
Ah, yes, friends.

1286
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,220
Somewhere in here.

1287
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,400
The tapes are running backwards.

1288
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,820
Bob's my friend, and he's leading me somewhere.

1289
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,220
Let me in.

1290
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,340
Is he waiting there for me?

1291
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,820
Is that him waiting for me?

1292
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,820
Bob's my friend, and he's leading me somewhere.

1293
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Leading me around.

1294
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,140
What could be waiting there for me?

1295
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,320
What's waiting for me?

1296
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,140
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

1297
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,300
Stop them from killing me.

1298
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,160
Stop them from killing me.

1299
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,660
Ah!

1300
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,500
Ah!

1301
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,820
Bob can't help me.

1302
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,180
He can help.

1303
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,540
But will he?

1304
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,200
Will he help me?

1305
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,660
He can help me.

1306
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,500
Bob's my inner guide.

1307
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,760
And he's leading my body.

1308
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,180
He's my body.

1309
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,620
He's even nice to my pets.

1310
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,460
Nice is not super.

1311
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,380
Bob's that little voice.

1312
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,200
And he's not just a dream now.

1313
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,020
Not just a dream.

1314
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,100
The mightiest guru yet.

1315
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,380
The mighty is.

1316
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,280
The mighty is.

1317
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,920
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

1318
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,980
Not yet.

1319
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,280
He can't.

1320
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,680
Never put the love's ticket to Bill'são.

1321
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:40,760
Possibly.

1322
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,920
.. but said more than I need.

1323
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,900
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

1324
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,920
Total-让- Freedom!

1325
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,060
And so did Kot nossos tên của Diabo!

1326
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,660
Live

1327
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:14,220
What is waiting there for me?

1328
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,560
What is waiting for me?

1329
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,680
Help me somebody.

1330
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,580
That was Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

1331
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,340
Yes, indeed.

1332
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,600
He's the youngest doctor out there from Knoxville, Tennessee.

1333
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,200
And a true crib fisherman.

1334
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,040
Yeah, he's a crib fisherman.

1335
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,400
He'd be fishing out of some cribs, I tell you, Bob.

1336
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,680
Yeah, looking for some prairies.

1337
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah, he'd be a squid fisherman.

1338
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,140
Well, they do have prairie squid in Tennessee

1339
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,540
because there is sufficient prairie there, or at least open lake.

1340
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,120
Well, they have those gulch squids, they call them.

1341
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,220
Yeah, they got some of that delta squid down around New Orleans.

1342
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,900
But I don't know about that delta squid.

1343
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,920
It kind of tastes muddy.

1344
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,800
That's my favorite kind, boy.

1345
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,020
Do you like that?

1346
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,040
With red beans and rice?

1347
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,160
Yeah, after you use them, I'll only eat them after they've been used.

1348
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,280
Well, they aren't even good.

1349
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,480
That's right.

1350
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,400
They're tough.

1351
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,180
You've got to soften them up a bit.

1352
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,560
You've got to tenderize them a little, as the doctor would say.

1353
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,260
Yes.

1354
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,260
Oh, yes.

1355
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,320
And find squid.

1356
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,060
So I'll tell you.

1357
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,440
Oh, this little famous piece of music is also by Dr. Onan.

1358
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,160
I believe that's part of the Hour of Slack introduction at times, is it not?

1359
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,380
Yeah, yeah, right.

1360
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,360
He's got a new one on the way, a new digital Bob song.

1361
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,180
See, everything's digital.

1362
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,480
It's digital here.

1363
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,500
We're not live.

1364
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,340
That's why we can't take any calls.

1365
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,660
This show has been entirely on...

1366
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:43,280
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything on this show.

1367
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,880
That includes move the turntable around with your fingertips.

1368
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,340
But we don't use turntables.

1369
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,240
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.

1370
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,500
And friends, praise Bob, a tape deck can be smashed to pieces.

1371
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,640
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will...

1372
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,600
Praise Bob and pass the Habifrop Zip-You-Lops, doctor.

1373
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,320
Oh, yes.

1374
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,560
Let's step into a quick moment.

1375
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,860
From a subgenius revival.

1376
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,580
This was the last one in L.A.

1377
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,120
You were there as security, running security.

1378
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,260
And Bob got shot again anyway.

1379
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh, yes.

1380
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,600
But this time it was one of those dispensable Bobs.

1381
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,200
Yes.

1382
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,460
He was afraid to go out there.

1383
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,780
He knew the guy that wore the Bob mask in L.A.

1384
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,660
And it was a Bob mask.

1385
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,720
I mean, Bob, the real Bob, wouldn't go in L.A. at the Alexandria Hotel.

1386
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,080
Yeah, he certainly wouldn't be seen at the Alexandria Hotel.

1387
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:31,980
That's for sure.

1388
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,020
In fact, I didn't even want to be seen at the Alexandria.

1389
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,180
In fact, nobody wanted to.

1390
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,460
The only thing that was really seen was obscene.

1391
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:45,500
And that was that obscene big dead rat that was in the Pope of New York's breakfast table or something like that.

1392
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,140
I forget it was.

1393
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,040
That's the way popes are treated in L.A., friends.

1394
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,100
That last year.

1395
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,000
Last year.

1396
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,500
Oh, speaking of popes in L.A., doctor, before you play that, I think we ought to...

1397
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:01,200
Most people don't know that the Pope of all Arkansas, who's on temporary combat duty in Los Angeles,

1398
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,220
reaffirmed his nuptials.

1399
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,620
Yes, he did.

1400
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,720
He did.

1401
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,000
And he did it the subgenius way, too.

1402
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,440
He got...

1403
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,080
It wasn't...

1404
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,480
He had already gotten a short-duration marriage.

1405
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,380
That's right.

1406
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,420
From Pastor Naked, the official one.

1407
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:14,740
He already had the paperwork.

1408
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,100
He did have the paperwork.

1409
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,480
He would have sanctified couplings, friends, for the last few years.

1410
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,500
But their short-duration marriage ran out.

1411
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,500
And rather than send Buck any more money, they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel,

1412
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,320
as Norm just told me they're called, a parlor chapel wedding.

1413
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,100
Marriage parlor.

1414
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,320
Yeah.

1415
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,360
When he left the chapel, this acolyte came running in.

1416
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,660
You know, it was one of those ten-minute ceremonies.

1417
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,060
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going,

1418
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,540
Sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote,

1419
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,060
to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said,

1420
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,380
Sir, kill me.

1421
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,140
That's right.

1422
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:56,300
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno and his faithful ubermatrix,

1423
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,620
that is to say, Miss Dottie.

1424
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,080
That's right.

1425
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,940
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

1426
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,340
Yes, sir.

1427
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,540
They are.

1428
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,200
They are further contaminating the gene pool.

1429
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:11,440
Sterno's father, the way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys who had to stand on the Nevada desert

1430
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,780
and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

1431
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,720
Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

1432
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,340
Mm-hmm.

1433
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,960
Duck and cover, baby.

1434
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,740
You betcha.

1435
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:30,080
But they weren't allowed to in those days, and the result is thousands of subgenius children of those selfless servicemen

1436
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,500
who gave their genitalia.

1437
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,140
Genetic structure.

1438
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,760
Gave their genes for...

1439
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,980
For nuclear dominance.

1440
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,780
There you go.

1441
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,820
And rather than...

1442
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,180
I was about to play that Hal song from the L.A. Divival,

1443
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,800
but I think instead we will, Dr. Dool, dare to play this live report from L.A.

1444
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,100
Sterno, we're going to you now.

1445
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:57,940
This is Dr. Sterno Docs and Dr. Byron Verner of Famous Potatoes organization in Los Angeles.

1446
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,280
Can you hear Sterno?

1447
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,520
Sterno?

1448
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,400
Gee, bow.

1449
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,560
Bow-gey, bow-gey, bow-gey.

1450
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,040
Yep, that's them.

1451
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,000
Bow-gey, bow-gey.

1452
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,520
I'm having trouble.

1453
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,700
I don't think they can hear us.

1454
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,600
Sunset Boulevard.

1455
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,320
Bow-bow-bow-bow-gee, bow-gey, bow-gey-gee-gee.

1456
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,400
At this moment.

1457
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,640
Bow-bow-gee.

1458
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,440
Bow-bow-gee.

1459
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,180
Eat a bow-bow-gee.

1460
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,940
Eat a bow-bow-gee.

1461
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,760
Bow-bow-gee.

1462
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,640
Bow-bow-gee.

1463
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,420
Bow-bow-gee.

1464
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,160
Bow-bow-gee.

1465
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,880
Bow-bow-gee.

1466
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:27,480
Bow-bow-gee.

1467
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,600
Bow-bow-gee.

1468
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,400
Bow-bow-gee.

1469
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,860
Bubba Gee

1470
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,120
Well

1471
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,000
I don't really

1472
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,500
Bubba Gee

1473
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,900
Bubba Gee

1474
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,980
Bubba Gee

1475
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,480
Bubba Gee

1476
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,780
Much

1477
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,420
Much out of the limits of

1478
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,820
That sounds like Los Angeles

1479
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,280
Alright

1480
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,060
Better check in that purse might be a snapping turtle in there

1481
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,780
A snapping turtle

1482
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,680
Did he say doctor

1483
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,200
Gotta watch out for the coodles

1484
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,620
About going into these

1485
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,540
Lesbian snapping turtle bars

1486
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,720
Lesbian coodle bars we call them

1487
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,480
We told Doug about them yesterday

1488
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,520
The other Doug

1489
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,100
The famous Doug

1490
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,220
That's another place friends

1491
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,760
It's not the same thing anymore

1492
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,280
Where you can get those

1493
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,060
Prairie squid

1494
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,920
Drinks you can actually get prairie squid

1495
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,400
Drinks

1496
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,260
They put them in a blender

1497
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,800
With protein powder

1498
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,580
And just turn them into a really

1499
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,180
It's like

1500
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,180


1501
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,120
Kind of like a daiquiri

1502
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,860
In texture

1503
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,300
But it's not the real prairie squid though

1504
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,620
It's the flash frozen stuff

1505
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,280
I mean nobody

1506
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,480
Nobody does it with a live prairie squid

1507
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,620
Praise Bob

1508
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,500
Praise Bob

1509
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,360
Well dear friends

1510
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,940
It's time

1511
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,540
For a moment of

1512
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,940
Threadity and melody

1513
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,300
Yes if you'll turn to page five in your program

1514
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,760
I'm going to lead you in the hymn

1515
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,040
Which we call

1516
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,180
Bob is a

1517
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,800
This is my story

1518
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,940
This is a hymn which is usually performed

1519
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,160
In moments of extreme stress

1520
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,740
And such I judge this to be

1521
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,300
It's very easy

1522
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,800
And you can support me on the second verse

1523
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,400
And the chorus

1524
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,620
If you choose

1525
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,300
So we'll sing Bob is my story

1526
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,220
Page five

1527
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,500
I saw a man

1528
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,580
With a pipe and a grin

1529
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,180
All in my life

1530
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,800
A new morning light

1531
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,740
Smiling at me

1532
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,140
Like a madman

1533
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,800
Till he

1534
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,000
Made me uptight

1535
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,700
I told him

1536
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,760
Don't bother me anymore

1537
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,960
But he kept on

1538
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,120
Just the same

1539
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,700
Till I was totally

1540
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,700
Brainwashed

1541
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,480
Bob is his name

1542
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,800
This is the chorus

1543
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,460
He is my story

1544
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,560
Bob is my song

1545
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,700
Bob my amphetamines

1546
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,180
All the day long

1547
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,080
But I won't tear my poster of dogs down

1548
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,240
I'll feel no sadness or shame

1549
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,940
Till I rejoin him in dogs town

1550
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,980
Bob is his name

1551
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,440
I'll feel no sadness or shame

1552
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:30,440


1553
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,620
He has no lack of his patented slack

1554
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,620
For those of his following four

1555
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,420
He is the friend of whoever will send

1556
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,620
Green bags or gold

1557
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,060
He's growing stronger and stronger

1558
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,500
But he keeps redder than flame

1559
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,060
I'll be a pig boy no longer

1560
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,580
He'll be a pig boy no longer

1561
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,520
Bob is his name

1562
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,860
Bob is my story

1563
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,140
Bob is your story, friend.

1564
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,520
And Bob is your fame.

1565
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,880
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do.

1566
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,060
Keep your squid juices pumping.

1567
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,320
Bob...

1568
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,540
Well, that's held by the old digital counter on the wall, Reverend Stang.

1569
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,960
Yes, we're coming down. We got three minutes left.

1570
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,980
Three minutes of slack time, friends.

1571
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,860
And I could play some Burblin background noise,

1572
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
or I could play the official sign-off tunes and so forth, but...

1573
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,080
Well, we could just talk for another three minutes, but...

1574
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,980
We easily...

1575
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,340
Easily.

1576
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,540
Easily, yeah.

1577
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,260
We could talk for another three hours, friends.

1578
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,960
Or three days, if that's what it takes to get you to write to that sacred post office box.

1579
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,340
You've been hearing the learned old scholars of the Church of the Subgenius Society tonight.

1580
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,260
That's right.

1581
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,820
And learned we are in the dark knowledge and forbidden sciences

1582
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,800
of time control, slack extraction...

1583
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,080
And the arcane secrets of the prairie squid.

1584
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,120
Friends, are you gonna put up with what the gland owners are laying down on you?

1585
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:12,000
I want you to either stand up or shut up, baby.

1586
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,520
That's right. Praise Bob.

1587
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,480
You gotta hip out to it or die trying not to.

1588
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,460
Or just kill me.

1589
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,980
That's right. But, Dr. Gordon, I am going to use this last two minutes to play something I...

1590
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,560
I always mean to play and rarely do, and that's the credits for the hour of slack.

1591
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:28,880
Yeah.

1592
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,840
Even though all of these people weren't...

1593
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,960
Being as how that's the only money those people get is the credits, maybe you ought to roll them once in a while, Reverend Stang.

1594
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,240
That's right.

1595
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,840
Roll those credits.

1596
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,020
The problem is they're an hour and a half long, so...

1597
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:45,120
Friends, Norm Ward and the Monday Morning Creatures will shut off this tape at the proper allotted time.

1598
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,080
Praise Bob or kill me.

1599
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,960
Help me, somebody.

1600
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,100
My legs are on fire.

1601
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,660
She ain't got no legs.

1602
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,780
Pull the lever.

1603
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,680
Down you go.

1604
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:06,620
The voices, tapes, music, and editing you've been listening to come from...

1605
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,520
...Jalebo Abernathy...

1606
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,940
...The Buck, Naked, and the Jaybirds...

1607
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,520
...Dr. Odan Canobite...

1608
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,680
...G. Gordon Gordon, Killer Fruits...

1609
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,080
...The Lion...

1610
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,140
Help me, somebody.

1611
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,000
She ain't got no legs.

1612
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,240
...Doctors for Bob...

1613
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,240
...Dr. Philodrummond, Overman, First Degree...

1614
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,980
...Reverend Cleve, Donut, Duncan...
