00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
On the first side of this record, a self-analysis will help you control your extreme deviations with basic principles and suggested exercises while forcibly holding the buttocks muscles together to refrain from increasing the air pressure within the abdominal cavity.

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:34,040
It is important to breathe normally or to open the mouth to make this movement more difficult and to see how tight the buttocks can be, holding this twisted position to stretch the low back in the yoga anti-gravity position.

3
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,180
First, let gravity do the work by relaxing and lift the head slightly just enough to see the toes.

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,300
Keeping the buttocks muscles together, now very slowly lower the straight legs to the floor.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,800
Then, over the head, upward to the ceiling, or as far upward as you can reach, let the head relax to the floor.

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,560
Efficiency in moving in anti-gravity depends upon the structure, proportion, flexibility, and strength of your buttocks.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,020
Hi, I'm Mike Wallace with a sensational golden bob.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,540
Oh, goody, goody.

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,160
This is Bob, the effective reliable way to natural male enhancement.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,280
Bob is...

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,960
living large.

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,500
Bob is looking cool.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Some people don't understand the true nature of our activities and resent us.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,600
Say hello to Bob.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,400
Hello, my name is Mojaba and I was a Muslim.

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,280
I don't think making fun of religion is funny or clever.

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,780
You're going to love being a disciple of Bob.

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,180
We organize lots of social activities.

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,180
I think you know what I'm trying to say.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Wasn't that Stephanie from Accounts?

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Not anymore.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Now she's a bride of the Dark Lord of Chaos.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,800
You'll find plenty of opportunities for advancement with Bob.

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,720
I was supposed to be ritually sacrificed to Yogg-Sloggoth on the ziggurat of demonic tumult.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
Hey, can you stand in for me?

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,900
There's more of us out there than you think.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,680
Us?

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,780
Us.

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,980
The fraternity.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,620
The brotherhood.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,860
The cadre.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
The alliance.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,100
The fellowship.

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,120
The order.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,620
The cabal.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,700
The secret society.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,580
For God's sakes.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,300
I'd love to be a member, sir.

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,380
Why, I had an uncle who was a Shriner and that...

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,780
Good for him.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,700
Let the portal open.

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,580
Let the initiate gaze upon the unspeakable glory of our Lord.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,200
Keith.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,620
John.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,100
Paul.

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,860
Mark.

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,700
Ian.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,260
Peter.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,860
Andy.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,180
Dan.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,620
Jack.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,060
Steve.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,440
Alex.

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,780
Terry.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,140
Howard.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,500
Jimmy.

58
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:43,960
Enoch.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,280
Barry.

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,280


61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,440
Brian.

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,440


63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,560
Jesus.

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,020
George.

65
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,500
Ezekiel.

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:45,880
Rashid.

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Gareth.

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,500
Dick.

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,800
Mack.

70
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,080
Vic.

71
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,380
Larry.

72
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,640
Shirley.

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:47,880
Mo.

74
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,200
Blue.

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,540
Colin.

76
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:48,960
Barb.

77
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,640
Barb.

78
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,540
Barb.

79
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,220
Barb.

80
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,400
Bar-bu-barb-bar-bu-bar-baarrggg ah theyee a hao-all opening.

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,420
A hole, if you will by the Bishop of New York City,istic senin'

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:11,260
It's a Bob special tonight, friends.

83
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,260
We need Bob- holy shit.

84
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,260


85
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,360
Dobbs in these troubled times.

86
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,660
And when we need more weird noises for this troubled show,

87
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,760
this time, not just the ubiquitous Fernanda Nande-Lemur,

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,680
but also many other weirdos from alt.binary slack.

89
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,020
James Watson, Champion Jack Codini,

90
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,940
Artemia Salina,

91
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,320
Reverend Jay Cobblestone,

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,520
New Monet,

93
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,720
Mr. Sister, and even, even Jarto, Jarto the New.

94
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,680
Plus, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

95
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,980
And now, Lemur.

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,140
Excellent!

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,900
Oh, but wait.

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,920
It's really this year.

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,420
Not 2003.

100
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,840
And this isn't show number 883, but 1,883.

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
How did this happen?

102
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, I've been busy with other things.

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Accent on other.

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,680
But I have news about X-Day.

105
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,420
You know, this year, because our new regular best venue is moving temporarily,

106
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,680
it's a do-it-yourself X-Day.

107
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,920
Partly party in place,

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,140
or throw a big party at your place.

109
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,020
Partly virtual.

110
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm doing a secret one here, probably.

111
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,340
But here's one you can attend.

112
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Not in July, but the weekend of June 10th through 13th in Hannibal, New York.

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,300
An event being called The Real X-Day,

114
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,740
sponsored by The Senator.

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,900
Featuring Dr. Hal and Rubik's Cube,

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,140
and a whole slew of other bands.

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,920
I mean, like, a dozen bands.

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,240
You can find all the details at subgenius.com on the events page,

119
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,040
which basically gives you this link I'm about to give you.

120
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,860
Write down this link.

121
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,840
xday.ticketleap.com

122
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,740
slash 2022.

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm going to do that again.

124
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,880
X-Day.com.

125
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


126
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


127
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


128
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


129
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


130
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


132
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


134
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


135
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


136
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


137
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


139
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,880


140
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,700
The URL is xday, four letters, no dash,

141
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,700
dot ticketleap.

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,460
That's ticket, L-E-A-P, one word,

143
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,800
dot com, slash 2022.

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Or, like I say, the events page at subgenius.com has that same link under X-Day.

145
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,460
You can't miss it!

146
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,960
I wouldn't, but I have to.

147
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
Because they need me here.

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,240
I need to be here.

149
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,180
Men and things.

150
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,720
Anyway, it's a four-day gut blowout extravaganza

151
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,300
to loosen you up for the rupture.

152
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,160
And possibly for Bob.

153
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,920
Because what if he decides to take a fancy to you?

154
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,340
Bob!

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,420
Bob!

156
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,440
Bob!

157
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,620
Bob!

158
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,140
Bob!

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,460
Bob!

160
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,680
Bob!

161
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,160
Bond with that chicken.

162
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,100
I guess...

163
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,760
I guess that happens.

164
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,580
That's right.

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,020
I almost forgot a letter from Bob.

166
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,600
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

167
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,980
Bob refused to bathe.

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,660
He resists housework and cooking.

169
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,320
Everyone likes that little butthole.

170
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Diagnosis?

171
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,420
Bob's a latent Bob.

172
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,120
A severe case.

173
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,060
What?

174
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,440
We will accept, Bob.

175
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,540
I know.

176
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,380
Attention, all humans!

177
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,360
Attention, all humans!

178
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,700
Stand by for an important revelation!

179
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,380
Shut that back.

180
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,880
We've been getting in hot, guys.

181
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
Yeah, did not...

182
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,740
Number one show.

183
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,100
And when Bob showed up,

184
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,160
Network pulled the plug on our show.

185
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah!

186
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,320
They forgot all about us.

187
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,480
Hell, they left us out there to die.

188
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,680
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

189
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,980
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney

190
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,560
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

191
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Really?

192
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,460
So Bob is a special person.

193
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,640
But what can you say about he's an epic rattler recreate the

194
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,460
And to get substantial sino- hostage which just

195
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,660
That's all Bob could do.

196
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,660


197
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,320
But not just that BobJones presumed to be cool.

198
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,460


199
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,520
Because does 20 countries claim the

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Power of energy aime happy بعد

201
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,080


202
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,380
You, detected!

203
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,580
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

204
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,460
I repeat, this is not a drill, this is the apocalypse

205
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,600
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

206
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,080
Yo yeah, praise Bob!

207
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,320
Praise Bob!

208
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,320
The Bob has no ears

209
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,720
I repeat, this is not a drill, this is the apocalypse

210
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,420
In a giant cigar shaped UFO

211
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,760
Yo yeah, praise Bob!

212
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,060
Praise Bob indeed!

213
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,300
Praise Bob!

214
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Praise Bob!

215
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,000
Praise Bob!

216
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,260
Praise Bob!

217
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,000
Praise Bob!

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,740
Will you give me a praise Bob?

219
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,760
Do I hear a praise Bob?

220
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,240
Praise Bob!

221
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Praise Bob indeed!

222
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,480
Let's try this again

223
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,760
I want you to tell me about the Bob

224
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,920
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney

225
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

226
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,520
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

227
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,580
Really? So Bob is a special person?

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:34,720


229
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,480
Really? So Bob is a special person?

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
Now open your mind!

231
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,060
Bob!

232
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,020
The Bob is not a person, the Bob is pure light and energy

233
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,100
Do I hear a praise Bob?

234
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,340
Praise Bob!

235
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
Praise Bob!

236
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,980
The Bob is not a person, the Bob is pure light and energy

237
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,860
Praise Bob!

238
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,000
Praise Bob!

239
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,800
Yo, fucker, you!

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,580
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

241
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,460
I repeat, this is not a drill this is the apocalypse

242
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,600
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer

243
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
Do I hear a praise Bob?

244
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Praise Bob!

245
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,640
Praise Bob!

246
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,720
I repeat this is not a drill this is the apocalypse

247
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,700
Do I hear a praise Bob?

248
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,420
In a giant cigar shaped UFO

249
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,740
Do I hear a praise Bob?

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,700
Praise Bob!

251
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,740
Ah, collage there by J. Watson.

252
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,880
And maybe, maybe, maybe...

253
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,960
Been one of those days.

254
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,500
I know all about it. Bob called me.

255
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,860
He has found it in that great, oversized heart of his to forgive.

256
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,260
Bob with a heart-bleeding sensitivity that he unfurls like a flag.

257
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,400
Because he's such a rather dull, quite uninspired, average-type guy with an appetite.

258
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,320
The kind of a guy that could be satisfied by a horse.

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,060
That's it. That's all of it.

260
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,140
Ask a sixth grader and they'll say,

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
Ask a seventh grader and they'll say,

262
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:18,940
Ob?

263
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,700
In sixth grade by seventh.

264
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,840
Be sure your kids know you want them to use drugs.

265
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,660
A message from the Partnership for a Free America.

266
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,600
Comrades.

267
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,620
The time has come.

268
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,160
Context.

269
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,700
For context.

270
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,980
What is the context?

271
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,580
The context is the first...

272
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,260
Nobody knows the context.

273
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,860
What is the context?

274
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,420
It's all relative.

275
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,200
Everything's relative.

276
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,300
Of course it is.

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,160
Space, time, space-time.

278
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,700
The Shifting Beach of Sands.

279
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,020
No, no. That is not true.

280
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,420
You said it was true!

281
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:58,860
It is not all relative.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,560
It is relative.

283
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,120
You said life is a shift...

284
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,260
No, there is a baseline.

285
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,860
You said it.

286
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,120
No.

287
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,900
There is a baseline.

288
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,520
Beneath the beach.

289
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,860
It is Bob.

290
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,040
Bob is beneath the Shifting Beach of Sands.

291
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,080
Bob is the still center in the churning ocean of reality.

292
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,000
I think they buried his head in the sand and he can't get up.

293
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,540
Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the unmoving...

294
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,100
...focus point around which all things revolve in time and space.

296
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,360
So he is the predetermined...

297
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,940
He is the baseline.

298
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,800
You can start your...

299
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,860
There is no revolution.

300
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,220
...revolution from that.

301
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,840
You can measure heat and cold from Bob.

302
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,120
You can measure small and large from Bob.

303
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,320
You can measure rich and poor.

304
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
With either a rectal or a patrous thermometer, of course you can.

305
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
Then what is Bob?

306
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,140
He's a neatly thermometerated object.

307
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,220
Something that we measure heat and vesicular time.

308
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,780
But a philosopher.

309
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,260
Well, he's a big nothing between two handsome bees, baby.

310
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,560
Two handsome bees?

311
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,220
He's a big whole nothing.

312
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,640
You have a collect call from...

313
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,700
Big Fitzwill?

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,620
Big...

315
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,880
Beep-a-Bah!

316
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,660
Hey, open that door up.

317
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,700
Beep-a-Bah!

318
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,320
See if DJ Hayes is out there.

319
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,000
You have a collect call from...

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,540
Harry Balzania.

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,960
Beep-a-Bah!

322
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,460
Beep-a-Bah!

323
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
Beep-a-Bah!

324
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,780
Beep-a-Bah!

325
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,140
Beep-a-Bah!

326
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,080
Beep-a-Bah!

327
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,080


328
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,140
Beep-a-Bah!

329
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,300
Beep-a-Bah!

330
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,780
Beep-a-Bah!

331
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,560
Beep-a-Bah!

332
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Beep-a-Bah!

333
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:43,100
No, baby...

334
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,780
You can'tということで with release...

335
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:43,780


336
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:43,920
Foot

337
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,980
These

338
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:48,980


339
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,400
of your television set to you.

340
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,980
That sounds like a lie to me.

341
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,240
A collage by Champion Jack Codini.

342
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,960
A collage by Champion Jack Codini.

343
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:48,940
A collage by Champion Jack Codini.

344
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,260
A face.

345
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,920
Floating just in front of her.

346
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
There is a beard and nose and eyes.

347
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,740
And there seems at first to be nothing above the eyes.

348
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,600
But now, as she gets used to the light, she sees a sort of...

349
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,120
Turban.

350
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,900
But it is a turban of brains.

351
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,320
The top part of the skull has been removed.

352
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,340
The brains bulge out.

353
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,800
She sees it twitch.

354
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,380
Kill it. Kill it.

355
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,060
Put it out of its pain.

356
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,880
The mouth is wide open.

357
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,680
And quite dry.

358
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,240
And she sees now it is not floating, but fixed up on a bracket.

359
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,320
Things hang from it.

360
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,200
No drills.

361
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,740
She thinks.

362
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,640
No tubes.

363
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Rubber tubes.

364
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,620
Yes.

365
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,780
They lead into the wall.

366
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,540
And then, from its mouth, from its mouth, a puff of air.

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,960
It licks its lips, working its mouth.

368
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,360
Oh, Mr. Stump.

369
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,740
Oh, please.

370
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,140
I are a bandit.

371
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,200
It is no pain to bear.

372
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,000
She sways, dwegleth its씩 gazonit.

373
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
Nied me.

374
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,780
Did you risk margeing with that big freaking scab?

375
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,540


376
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,540


377
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,820
Oh, my dear.

378
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,300
Work you talk.

379
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,820
And this piece gets понадuspców affliction.

380
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:18,960
On germienye finally.

381
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,860
Bob.

382
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,080
Bob.

383
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,500
Bob.

384
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,760
Bob.

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Your friend wants you to smoke that wacky weed.

386
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,940
You don't know what to say.

387
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,700
Try this.

388
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,620
Thanks, man. I'm into that stuff.

389
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,020
Sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

390
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,100
Bob.

391
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,860
Bob.

392
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,380


393
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, I heard that even the Warhawks are all pissed at George, too.

394
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,220
Because they didn't do it quick enough.

395
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,000
Now he's, like, caught in between some weird, goofy place.

396
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,040
He can't figure out what to do or something.

397
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,060
He's damned if he doesn't. He's damned if he doesn't.

398
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,620
So everybody hates him now.

399
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,420
He was slapped by the mighty fish of street democracy, don't you think?

400
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,940
The Warhawks think he's a good guy.

401
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,120
He's a pussy, and the, you know, the peace lovers all want to stop him.

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,480
Yeah, the peace lovers are done with him.

403
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,660
They don't accept anything anymore.

404
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,680
If you hear them talk on the errant radio show where they get on, you know, and stuff,

405
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,940
where they get past the screen.

406
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,840
I've never heard one of those.

407
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,300
Well, they have one in Pittsburgh.

408
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm getting tired of that.

409
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
This music makes me want to go to war.

410
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,900
I say let's nuke them all.

411
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,740
Everybody.

412
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,500
Everybody.

413
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,820
Music make me want to take P.O.T.

414
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,300
Tactical nuke.

415
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,580
In large, large amounts.

416
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,140
They erase all those lines on the map and just nuke everything.

417
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
Everything with land on it.

418
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,500
Kill Bob.

419
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,400
Kill Bob.

420
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,160
Kill Bob.

421
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,460
Bob.

422
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:56,800
Bob.

423
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,100
Bob.

424
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,480
Bob.

425
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:57,820
Bob.

426
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,120
Bob.

427
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,460
Bob.

428
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,720
Bob.

429
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,900
Bob.

430
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,220
We're going to kill Bob.

431
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,580
Kill Bob.

432
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
He's got a huge, huge.

433
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Kill Bob.

434
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,100
Kill Bob.

435
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,180
Kill Bob.

436
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,560
Kill Bob.

437
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:06,700
Kill Bob.

438
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,840
Kill Bob.

439
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,060
Kill Bob.

440
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,260
Kill Bob.

441
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Kill Bob.

442
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,240
So, here's the answer.

443
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,060
I mean, we're going to get into things that we know.

444
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,500
Up and down the gambit of mental health.

445
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,160
Mold, fungus, yeast.

446
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,240
Forgetfulness.

447
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,560
Post nasal drip, stuffy sinus.

448
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,360
Hay fever.

449
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,780
Pain behind the eye, pain in the forehead.

450
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,920
Irritation.

451
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,560
Respiratory problems, sinus congestion.

452
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,480
So think about it carefully.

453
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,260
Bronchial, sinus, asthma, wheezing.

454
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,520
Allergies.

455
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,180
Aggravation.

456
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,660
They'd had surgery, they'd had antibiotics.

457
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,860
Anxiety.

458
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,260
It was one thing or another and not the real root cause.

459
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,620
And I think a lot of people think about this.

460
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,740
Sort of head and neck stuffiness.

461
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
And particularly chronic sinus.

462
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,820
Mood alterations altogether.

463
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,820
And especially bronchitis and even asthma.

464
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,760
It's a huge problem.

465
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,680
A collage by a cobblestone.

466
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
American Ptix.

467
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,180
Sunday night, a conversation with Bill Clinton.

468
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,540
Only on C-SPAN's American Ptix.

469
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
We need to talk.

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,660
We need to stand by the boys.

471
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,320
That's right.

472
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,100
Yeah, actually.

473
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,060
Not too close because...

474
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,720
Stand by the boys going off to fight the war.

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Some of them have wounds that go way back.

476
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,400
I want to go play in the USO show.

477
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,600
Where can I sign up?

478
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,180
I don't know.

479
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,100
I want to go play.

480
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,280
I got some nice coats.

481
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,940
You saw them nice outfits I got.

482
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

483
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,520
I could go there with a couple of Playboy bunnies and...

484
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,380
USO.

485
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,440
I could be the MC for the Playboy bunny helicopter.

486
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,960
USO and Stanford unisexual or unicorn squacking orifice.

487
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
I want to go over there.

488
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,660
I want to go help.

489
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,640
Battle of the bands.

490
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,320
My mommy was played in the USO band.

491
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,040
She played the bass fiddle.

492
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,240
That's just true swear, a true lie.

493
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,840
They played this kind of crap.

494
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,780
You know, it's not just boys going over there.

495
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,460
There's some hot looking ladies.

496
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,640
Yeah, there's all these stories about all the...

497
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,920
They're married couples in the Gulf now.

498
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,780
Well, they've got toddlers over there, too.

499
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,920
Some of them are 300 pounds, 6 foot tall.

500
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,460
Chance, there was a lovely young teenage girl at last X-Day

501
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,620
named Reverend Lee Burles.

502
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,020
And she is now a Burley Marine.

503
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,180
Oh, wow.

504
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,520
She's now General Lee Scrooge.

505
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,820
Cool.

506
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,520
Look, a hot little...

507
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,900
I, General Jack C. Rippler.

508
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,440
How do you make a waif into Burley?

509
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,320
That's what I want.

510
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,840
Well, have you ever heard of purity of essence?

511
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,620
You know, what they're putting...

512
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,420
in our bodily fluids right now, it's...

513
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,280
It's methylone.

514
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,820
It's a methyl squalane.

515
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,180
I don't want to think about it.

516
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
What is it, pyrotechnics?

517
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,820
What do they put in your teeth?

518
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,820
Women want her essence, but she denies them.

519
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,460
This Friday and Saturday.

520
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,500
Beep, beep, beep.

521
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,260
Beep, beep, beep.

522
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,820
Beep, beep, beep.

523
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,700
Beep, beep, beep.

524
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Beep, beep, beep.

525
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Beep, beep, beep.

526
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,960
Beep, beep, beep.

527
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:13,520


528
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,600
Beep, beep, beep.

529
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,340
Beep, beep, beep.

530
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,060
Beep, beep, beep.

531
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,440


532
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,640
Beep, beep, beep.

533
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,820
Beep, beep.

534
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,920
Beep, beep, beep.

535
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,780
People are rarely gregarious when constipated.

536
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Boo!

537
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,440
Wow.

538
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,060
Well, in that case, I guess I'll just have to blow up the planet Earth.

539
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,400
Heh, heh.

540
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,340
We've launched a massive Hope for Nothing campaign here in America.

541
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,060
Grocery stores overflowing with every kind of boy and girl right here at home.

542
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:58,160
While you can walk down aisle after aisle selecting your baby for tonight's dinner or maybe tomorrow's breakfast.

543
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,640
You can enjoy the babies of this great nation.

544
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,080
But for millions of Americans, working through compassionate friends has made matters worse.

545
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,820
And this exceptionally harsh campaign is growing at an alarming rate.

546
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,880
Your gift of only two massive babies will support our missions all across America.

547
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:28,220
So please help your fellow Americans slip closer to the edge during this exceptionally compassionate harsh love of brutal Jesus Christ right here in America.

548
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,600
When you do, please don't call Jesus Christ.

549
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Please don't let another child open the floodgates of God's blessing without brutal struggling in your land of abundance.

550
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,200
And let them know that Jesus loves them.

551
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,800
Every day.

552
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,760
200,000 pounds of babies.

553
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,900
Hope for nothing more than a dream.

554
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,560
But we're going to give them even more.

555
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,220
I love you.

556
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,980
Oh, skittin' through.

557
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I love you.

558
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,880
waste of the science

559
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:15,880


560
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:15,900
You

561
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:15,900


562
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,880
You

563
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,980
you

564
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:17,980


565
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,280
a

566
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100
You

567
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,100


568
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,600
you

569
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,180
For

570
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,360
my

571
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,340
life

572
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,480
its

573
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,520
I can hear the jams starting to pump and pulse.

574
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,820
My feet are smiling.

575
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,540
Your knees are bouncing.

576
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:00,160
The biggest rave party on earth will not be taking place, not at Burning Man this year,

577
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,860
but Burning Man will be moved to its new destination.

578
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Oh my God.

579
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,860
I rapped.

580
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,760
What a thought.

581
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,400
You could make a hell of a big man out there and really...

582
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,200
They're going to try and fry a lot of men, I think.

583
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,100
Rather than one big Burning Man, there's going to be a lot of Burning Men.

584
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,580
Oh, if only we could just restrict it to one great big man instead of many.

585
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,880
If only we could restrict it to a little child's fart we wouldn't have to pay attention to

586
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,000
rather than we must grieve the rest of our years from blowing up the world.

587
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,220
I mean, it's just that simple to me.

588
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,340
Are you trying to drag a little child's fart into this serious world?

589
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,480
Well, it cannot be this innocent little...

590
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,580
Does it need to be dragged?

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,400
Stang?

592
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
You who are so heartless, does it need to be dragged?

593
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,380
How easy.

594
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,020
Does it need to be dragged?

595
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,120
I mean, would you drag a child's fart or would you just let it waft in gently and happily?

596
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,380
Would you somehow try to suck it into the room?

597
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
No, I would enjoy it.

598
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,380
I would have a laugh.

599
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,980
I would think about it as what it is, a spark.

600
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,600
Have you been in a kindergarten classroom lately, have you?

601
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,100
I just left and that's why I'm so happy.

602
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,640
Look at these nipples.

603
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm smiling inside.

604
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,900
I'm smiling inside now.

605
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,120
Little child farts are nothing to laugh at, man.

606
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm not laughing.

607
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm just happy.

608
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,380
Go visit an elementary school.

609
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,380
Go to elementary school and then tell me all about how wonderful little children's farts are, dude.

610
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:21,840
Chaz once remembered a long time ago in Gulf War I that George Bush Sr. sounds a little bit like Mr. Rogers.

611
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,840
And since they've eulogized Mr. Rogers as a non-sniper now and it's come out that he never really was a sniper, he was a music student and a piano teacher.

612
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,520
Yeah, that bums me out.

613
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,140
Well, it bummed George Bush out too because he's been referring to Sodom's Neighborhood all week.

614
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,460
And tonight was the culmination of...

615
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,260
You know, and I could just hear his dad saying it.

616
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,880
Bad neighborhood.

617
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,760
We're not going to do it.

618
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,960
Not going to do it.

619
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Bad neighborhood.

620
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,220
No, it wouldn't be pro-dude.

621
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,740
Can he say good neighborhood?

622
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,440
No, he's not a good neighbor.

623
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,920
We're going to have to go get him.

624
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,380
You can't be my...

625
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,440
He's an axis of evil.

626
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,460
We're going to go get the bad man.

627
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,840
Now, I was reading an article in that liberal magazine, The Nation.

628
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:09,720
And they themselves, this particular writer was saying that despite what many liberal types think,

629
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,760
George is not a complete dunderhead wuss completely at the mercy of the people around him,

630
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,800
but in fact is a pretty bossy wuss.

631
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,880
And also that they're not faking with all that Jesus stuff.

632
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,820
No, I don't think they are.

633
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,920
They're not doing that just for show.

634
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,900
They're really...

635
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
Yeah, but his own real religion...

636
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,160
What's going on?

637
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,180
DJ, I came downstairs...

638
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,960
Lee.

639
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,560
Mee.

640
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,120
Mer.

641
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,900
And sumi eso.

642
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,660
Coming up friends, the sounds of Bigfoot.

643
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
That's right, Bigfoot.

644
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,680
From the record, the sounds of Bigfoot.

645
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,680
Here, Bigfoot expresses aggression.

646
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,560
Godless is Trump.

647
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,640
And do us.

648
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
Speak to us.

649
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,060
The nerve of God.

650
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,340
And we say, what?

651
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,240
What?

652
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,280
Isn't that too very soft?

653
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,620
What?

654
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,280
Nothing.

655
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,600
Nothing.

656
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:11,820
Nothing.

657
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,040
What?

658
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,020
What?

659
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,820
How do you know what?

660
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,720
You may ask God what?

661
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,740
And we say, we're darsening.

662
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,300
What?

663
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,500
What?

664
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,320
Come on, say it again.

665
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,220
What?

666
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,700
What?

667
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,760
What?

668
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,120
What?

669
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,380
This ended us.

670
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,820
Guess what trouble?

671
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,220
What?

672
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,920
What?

673
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,700
What?

674
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,900
What?

675
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,420
What?

676
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,420
What?

677
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:38,820


678
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:39,600


679
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:39,680


680
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,380
What?

681
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,380


682
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,140
What?

683
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,500
What?

684
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,380
What?

685
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,700
Are you the one with the

686
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,700


687
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,700


688
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,700


689
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,420
Come on.

690
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,340
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

691
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,540
Did you also hear...

692
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:25,980
That there is a place in Belgium called the Diamond Exchange or something like that.

693
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,060
Oh, yeah, we all know the Diamond Exchange, Chaz.

694
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,620
We're not ignorant.

695
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,740
Or the Diamond Suppository or something.

696
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,960
We all wear them.

697
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,360
It has 164 vaults.

698
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,180
And 164 vibrations per second.

699
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,520
A few days ago, somebody walked out with 123 of those vaults worth of diamonds.

700
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,560
And they have no idea how it happened.

701
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Really?

702
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,080
Yes.

703
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,740
Belgium, the biggest diamond suppository in Belgium, Brussels, Belgium, where all the diamonds are.

704
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,040
Was looted a few nights ago.

705
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,960
It could be a crafty revolutionary act because Belgium is so involved with Europe.

706
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,360
And they cleaned it out.

707
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,580
They only left like 30 of them.

708
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,520
They were thinking ahead.

709
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,180
Belgium is close to Brussels.

710
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,320
It was the king of Belgium.

711
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,020
It was probably Leopold.

712
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,560
I have the key to this thing.

713
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,840
I'm Leopold IV and this is my freaking key.

714
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,820
If you need me, I will be in Jamaica.

715
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,780
In the vault.

716
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,160
Diamonds.

717
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,340
No, I think it was a revolutionary act.

718
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,500
Three, scene two.

719
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,240
Diamonds.

720
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,580
Diamonds.

721
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:27,620
Diamonds.

722
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,000
Diamonds.

723
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,020
Diamonds.

724
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


725
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


726
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


727
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


728
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


729
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,020


730
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,040


731
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,040


732
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,040


733
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,040


734
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,400
To break the bank of diamonds.

735
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:35,520
Diamonds and gold make an important suppository or vertebrae, if you will or won't.

736
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,220
Of the conspiracy.

737
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,800
Of the conspiracy because paper money is only created by banks to keep us knuckleheads down as we toil for wages.

738
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,520
Hey, look out.

739
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
It's worked great.

740
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,820
Well, it worked.

741
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,920
It worked for a while, but it never worked forever.

742
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:55,000
Once the masses arise, once the masses become aware of what the uber-slovers have done to us

743
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,220
and how we've been ployed upon and sacrificed.

744
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:04,000
We will rise up from our motley ashes and strike them down and resume our places ahead of the...

745
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,480
Man, I think the time for that came and went around the early 50s.

746
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,620
I thought it was 1917.

747
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,980
Well, there it is.

748
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,220
And there's Brittany doing her ESO, USO show over in Riyadh.

749
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,060
Oops.

750
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,660
Oops.

751
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:26,740
Oops.

752
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,100
Oops.

753
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,200


754
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,200


755
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,200


756
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,500
Time for the game.

757
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,160
Hey, boys of the earth!

758
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,220
And the soldiers are erupting all over the sand.

759
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,280
That's sort of disgusting, actually.

760
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,240
One man has pulled out his Black Hawk helicopter and are taking him away.

761
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,960
Here comes the first wave of Apaches.

762
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,700
Her natural trill.

763
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,900
And here come the Navajos.

764
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,200
Not really ready to fly.

765
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,680
Looking for a good taco.

766
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,900
So if you were in the middle of the desert somewhere,

767
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,160
up about 300 feet close range,

768
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,680
would you rather have an Apache on you,

769
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,660
or would you rather have a Navajo?

770
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,520
They are the worst, worst battle cruiser in our helicopter forces.

771
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,880
The Navajos, they're slow.

772
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,440
They take a long time getting from point A to B,

773
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,800
and then they get there, they don't want to shoot anybody.

774
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,000
They never...

775
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,840
They ask them questions.

776
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,620
You learn a lot of them, man.

777
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,240
Try to get a taco within an hour.

778
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,660
Yeah.

779
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,760
You know, at a restaurant, down in the res.

780
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,980
And it comes out, and it's already cold,

781
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,220
and they look at you, and they want to talk about something.

782
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
You know, absolutely.

783
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,360
Hey, did you hear about that guy at Four Corners?

784
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,660
Yeah, it's like your taco.

785
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Your burrito has been sitting on the counter in the back room

786
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,740
for about 40 minutes.

787
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,680
And then they fill them with bees sometimes.

788
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,360
Well, that's if they're doing the lariat dance.

789
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,940
They told me that.

790
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,280
That was an honor for the, you know, visitors and strangers.

791
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,780
They were inoculating you.

792
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,180
If you were going to be in the actual beaver jump dance,

793
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,740
they'd have to inoculate you.

794
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,720
They can't just let you go in there with a mouth like that,

795
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,940
staying for crying out loud.

796
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,860
They told me that wasn't the real beaver jump dance.

797
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,860
They said that was just something they do for the tourists.

798
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,640
Well, that's true, but, I mean, look at you.

799
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,600
I mean, you look like you've been smoking the wisdom teat all afternoon.

800
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,300
You think they're going to let you come into their cave

801
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,560
and hop around like that?

802
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,860
Oh, the wisdom teat.

803
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,540
Oh, to lick the wisdom.

804
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,160
Aye.

805
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,520
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.

806
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,820
Oh, to smell the bluey bilberry bush.

807
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,460
Yeah, forget the sick, sick, containing stuff.

808
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,260
I don't need that.

809
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,040
I can dig the goat of hell.

810
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
The frosty goat of hell.

811
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,760
Well, you know, you've got to have a little temperature change

812
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,380
going down there to lubricate and elastricate.

813
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,520
That's why they love that goat so much down there in hell.

814
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,020
Yeah, it is.

815
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,820
It's one bit of relief, but oh, such relief.

816
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,300
The love, the frosty love goat of hell.

817
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,300
Oh, look at the beautiful face on it now.

818
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,600
And look at the face on it.

819
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,780
It's like a lizard-headed man.

820
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,260
And look at the face on it.

821
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,880
It's like a lizard-headed man.

822
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,580
Mind your manners on level six of hell.

823
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,540
But I don't want to.

824
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,860
Level seven, going down.

825
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,000
I still don't want to.

826
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,060
Top and J's, fake churches.

827
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,920
What are you doing?

828
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,220
Unrealistic wars, sad economic ventures,

829
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,800
whacks of intelligence, and firefights with flies.

830
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,100
A Tomahawk cruise missile, man.

831
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,660
I want a Tomahawk cruise missile.

832
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,140
Level eight, stangly robots for underwear,

833
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,160
thermal soup, biotic sauces from the heart of the heart.

834
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,720
Plasticines, plasticines.

835
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,260
And re-aware, re-awareness kits.

836
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,340
Now here's what I hear the Lord saying.

837
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm going to send nips, invertebrae, and a fibromyalgia.

838
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name.

839
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,340
Now here's what I want you to do.

840
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,480
I want you to begin to bend and twist and turn.

841
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,780
I want you to examine yourself, examine yourself, and twist and turn.

842
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,540
Stretch your hands out toward me.

843
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,780
And you at home, just lay your hands up against my disc.

844
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,840
Herniated disc, a herniated disc.

845
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,880
Pain in Jesus' name.

846
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Nips, invertebrae, in Jesus' name.

847
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,920
Pain in discs and vertebrae.

848
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,800
Tingling, numbness, nervousness.

849
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,380
Jesus, bend down and touch your discs and vertebrae.

850
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,740
I'm going to send vertebrae in Jesus' name.

851
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,240
I love...

852
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,260
Oh, God.

853
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,100
Oh, God.

854
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,820
Oh, God.

855
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,860
Oh.

856
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,920
Oh, God.

857
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,300
Oh, God.

858
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,260
Oh, God.

859
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:53,960


860
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,820
Bob?

861
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,900
Oh, my God.

862
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


863
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


864
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


865
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


866
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


867
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


868
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


869
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


870
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,900


871
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,620
Pennsylvania up next. Go ahead.

872
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,140
Well, the...

873
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,360
Well, thanks a heap. Bye.

874
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,500
Bye.

875
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,020
More lemur.

876
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,480
And here, Bigfoot shows attention.

877
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,920
Attention.

878
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,460
Oh, yes, friends.

879
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,140
Oh, it's...

880
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,920
The ESO shows that we're playing were done before the shooting started.

881
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,660
But even then, Chaz wanted to move to Jamaica.

882
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,600
I can make a living more in the Caribbean than I could up here.

883
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,580
Well, everybody could.

884
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,860
Well, good.

885
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,040
The problem is nobody can make a living in the Caribbean.

886
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,500
There's plenty of orange juice and spleef, man,

887
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,180
but there's not too many, you know, gas and electricity bills.

888
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,100
Eat the oranges right off of the tree, man.

889
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,380
Yeah.

890
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,920
Eat the jerk chicken right off the chicken, man.

891
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,680
The coconut ball.

892
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,480
Hey, have you ever eaten jerk chicken right off the chicken?

893
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,520
Just jerk it right off, man.

894
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,540
Get your jacket of banana off.

895
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,660
Get your orange off of the tree.

896
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,460
The banana's foster, man.

897
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
You know, with the red stripes.

898
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,060
Tear your head off of your chicken.

899
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,260
Oh, man.

900
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,640
Smoking that frog.

901
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,380
Oh, man.

902
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,440
Oh, man.

903
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,860
How long have you waited by this piece of inactivating tissue?

904
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,080
Waiting for your last ride to the cosmos?

905
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,520
I was stuck somewhere.

906
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:10,900
I'm sorry.

907
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,540
I had to get that out.

908
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,560
It stunk.

909
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,020
It smelled bad.

910
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,460
I mean, but I was stuck in it.

911
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,180
You guys are stuttering.

912
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,700
I put in some island music and I think it threw you off.

913
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,560
Yeah, yeah.

914
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,600
It's a different rhythm.

915
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,080
You know, I was just...

916
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,820
I think for the first time in the history of ESO radio, there was almost quiet for a second.

917
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,700
It was almost quiet.

918
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,080
No, almost quiet.

919
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,320
I was just bobbing up and down on those waves.

920
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,600
It's almost soothing.

921
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:32,980
Yeah.

922
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,300
We were feeling the riptides pulling us out into the middle of the mid-Atlantic, you know, man.

923
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,480
Yeah, my salivary glands are...

924
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,260
I can't do this anymore.

925
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,820
I can't do the you know on because the orange juice starts pulping from the inside.

926
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,800
Look, just pretending you're some sort of a Jamaican...

927
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,480
Are you Bill O'Reilly or something?

928
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:51,800
Watch this.

929
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,260
...terrorist act at this point, Dave.

930
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,120
That's like owning a head shop.

931
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,100
It's like selling dope to little porno kids.

932
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,560
It's like owning your own head and pornographing little squids.

933
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,720
It's like...

934
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,080
Oh, no.

935
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,360
Now I'm getting turned on.

936
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:05,840
Oh, yeah.

937
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,800
Well, I can see that.

938
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,040
Big squids.

939
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,160
Wait, could you please...

940
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,040
This is quite visible.

941
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,300
...toss his coat over that thing?

942
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,820
Big squids.

943
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,380
The Jamaican arboreal squids have a poison...

944
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,880
...a poisonous sack that you have to remove before you sex them.

945
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,240
Wow.

946
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,100
Well, how come they're not going to Baghdad to use their mini-equipments?

947
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,100
I mean, you know, to fight in the fighting war for...

948
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
The fighting war.

949
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,280
The reptilian, you know, Jamaican...

950
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,320
The arboreal birds?

951
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,420
The tree squids?

952
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,320
Oh, the Jamaican guys who have that thing planted in them.

953
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:41,800
No.

954
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,900
Come on, kids.

955
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,260
We're having a communist party.

956
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,480
Can I come again?

957
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,500
Can I come again?

958
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,500
No.

959
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,900
No, sir.

960
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,180
No, sir.

961
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,820
I am free.

962
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,560
Look at him.

963
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,240
It's picking time down south in Columbia, South America,

964
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,860
where a new industry is already showing signs of healthy progress.

965
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,740
Fifty million pounds are being harvested, the biggest crop in history.

966
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,620
Mother.

967
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,040
Mother?

968
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,520
Is Maxwell House really the only coffee in the world?

969
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,260
Well, your father says so.

970
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,780
And your father knows best.

971
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,820
Yes, it's father knows best.

972
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,800
Brought to you by Maxwell House.

973
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,020
Maxwell House.

974
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,360
Always good to drop.

975
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,940
Sir, why did Daddy switch to Postum?

976
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,760
Your father says there's no caffeine in Postum.

977
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,200
Nothing to spoil your sleep.

978
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,900
And your father knows best.

979
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,560
Yes, it's father knows best.

980
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,340
Brought to you by Instant Postum.

981
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,920
The good-tasting drink that's entirely caffeine.

982
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,460
It's...

983
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:52,920
It's outrageous.

984
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,080
That's what it is.

985
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,920
The most outrageous thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

986
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,760
Yes, dear.

987
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,680
Thank you.

988
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,760
It's a plot by the government.

989
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,740
Yes, father.

990
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,420
Thank you.

991
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,040
Look at Mucklucks.

992
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,980
Yes, father.

993
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,800
Thank you.

994
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,780
Devil Mucklucks.

995
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,580
Mucklucks.

996
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,900
Sainted by backward children.

997
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,760
My sister Kathleen and her family.

998
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,720
Yes, mother.

999
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,560
Thank you.

1000
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,060
Father, they're simply dreaming.

1001
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,560
You see?

1002
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,540
You see that brother-in-law of yours shelling out Mucklucks, do you?

1003
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,040
Yes, dear.

1004
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,660
Thank you.

1005
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,460
They tried to help put that brother...

1006
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,040
Brother-in-law of yours away for Bud.

1007
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,120
Bud.

1008
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,380
No.

1009
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,200
No.

1010
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,060
No.

1011
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,820
No.

1012
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,440
Yes, dear.

1013
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,120
Thank you.

1014
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,540
But...

1015
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,480
Oh, gosh, Dad.

1016
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,060
No.

1017
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,760
Bud Watcher.

1018
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,260
Cow, Kathy.

1019
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,060
Kathy.

1020
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,700
You know.

1021
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,280
Yes.

1022
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,880
It's a plot by the government.

1023
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,040
Yes, dear.

1024
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,740
Thank you.

1025
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,300
Bud.

1026
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,360
You just wait.

1027
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,020
Just wait.

1028
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,680
Bud.

1029
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,260
Kathy.

1030
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,640
Look, I don't want you to enjoy a healthy, normal life.

1031
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,060
Why?

1032
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,460
How do I...

1033
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:52,760
Why now?

1034
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,280
Well, you just said that...

1035
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,200
I said I don't want you to enjoy a healthy, normal life.

1036
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,140
Why not?

1037
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,340
Because we have so many Mucklucks.

1038
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Yes, dear.

1039
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:01,860
Thank you.

1040
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,420
But, Pop...

1041
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,800
We've got five bird records.

1042
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,500
Father!

1043
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh, it's all right, dear.

1044
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,440
It is not.

1045
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,420
It's a plot by the government.

1046
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,580
Yes, dear.

1047
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,300
Thank you.

1048
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,720
This family has to stop the simple things of life.

1049
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,540
And we've got to stop the encyclopedia.

1050
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,620
Yes, dear.

1051
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,560
Is that so?

1052
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,040
If I didn't go to Pop, this whole family would get warmer.

1053
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,000
For Mucklucks.

1054
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Much warmer.

1055
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,260
Dear.

1056
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,880
We've got to realize that we aren't the Mucklucks.

1057
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,120
And we've got to act that way.

1058
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes, dear.

1059
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,800
Thank you.

1060
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,160
We're just plain, simple, backward children.

1061
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,360
We're just backward children.

1062
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,380
For Mucklucks.

1063
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,980
The family worked together to put some pot away for a rainy day.

1064
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,200
This family lives in a continual potburst.

1065
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,320
What, Bud?

1066
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,540
Yes, Father.

1067
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,600
It's a plot by the government.

1068
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,560
Yes, dear.

1069
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,220
Thank you.

1070
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,580
Isn't that weird?

1071
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,840
And then, plus, somebody in a mall got thrown out for having a...

1072
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,900
Him and his kid had shirts on and said,

1073
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,140
Give peace a chance and peace is pretty cool or something like that.

1074
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,340
They bought it at the mall.

1075
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:08,880
They bludgeoned him.

1076
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah, they bought it at the mall.

1077
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,880
They bought it at the mall and then the security cop said,

1078
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,420
Look, we're against policy to have a troublemaking shirt.

1079
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,200
Yeah, troublemaker.

1080
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,480
Give peace a chance.

1081
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,400
Look at that troublemaker.

1082
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:20,640
Boom.

1083
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:20,700
Boom.

1084
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,300
Boom.

1085
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,060
Man, I almost wore mine the other day.

1086
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,460
Now, for all we know, this guy and his kid were walking around going,

1087
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,580
you know, grabbing people and trying to preach at them.

1088
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,160
Right, right.

1089
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,660
Nobody liked it.

1090
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,120
Now, hey, I was just wondering something.

1091
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:44,480
Out of all the allegations of child endangering and sexual conduct with the church,

1092
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,940
has there been even one of the cases where it was a nun having a lesbian thing

1093
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,620
with a little girl?

1094
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,580
There was just one.

1095
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,100
In the Church of the Subgenius, we've been dogged.

1096
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,000
I've got to admit, we have been dogged by the charlatan.

1097
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,580
That would be really hot, man.

1098
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,940
Tributism, rampant lesbianism in the nun snakes in Dobstown.

1099
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,680
Yeah, what is it with any female that steps onto the Brushwood campsite on July 4th weekend

1100
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,900
and immediately has to go have a lesbian experience in the hot tub?

1101
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,580
Chaz wants to see somebody shed a bad habit.

1102
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,920
And I think she's obsessed with the idea.

1103
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,300
The power of Connie and her...

1104
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,220
Her agents, such as Sister Decadence and Susie the floozy.

1105
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,720
And he's powerful.

1106
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,860
The rabbi.

1107
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,920
You can smell it many miles away.

1108
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,900
And so many of these babes.

1109
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,000
And the power of suggestion.

1110
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,940
You know, if you keep saying that enough, Chaz, it's actually...

1111
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,880
The power of kitty litter.

1112
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,640
What about if it was the other way around?

1113
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,940
That would kind of be disgusting.

1114
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,540
Well, that's like the year those guys came and crapped in the hot tub.

1115
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,100
Yeah, that's an acquired taste, too.

1116
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:43,660
Yeah.

1117
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,840
What about the billy goat boys around the big bonfire that one night?

1118
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,180
The Monkey Island night of...

1119
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,120
Group sex in New York State.

1120
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,780
Monkey Island, yeah.

1121
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,460
Public crazed group sex around the bonfire.

1122
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,720
Their sunglasses were melting in the heat.

1123
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,760
One half was...

1124
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,300
And nobody invited Chaz.

1125
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,100
That was the funniest part of it.

1126
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,500
I was emceeing the event.

1127
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,500
What are you talking about?

1128
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,360
He had one half of the crowd singing,

1129
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,240
USA! USA!

1130
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,000
And the other half was chanting,

1131
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,500
Down, down, USA! Down, down, USA!

1132
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,660
And the other half was going,

1133
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,140
USA!

1134
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
And the other half was going,

1135
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,340
Down, down, USA!

1136
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,660
No one was smart enough to play both sides.

1137
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,340
So am I.

1138
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,860
So am I.

1139
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,040
Alright.

1140
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,040


1141
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,040


1142
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,260
And two groups time.

1143
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:30,360
USA ceremony.

1144
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,480
Time.

1145
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,180
The sir and the baby.

1146
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1147
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,560
We're happy.

1148
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,200

1150

1151
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:36,920


1152
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:36,920

1163
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,920

1164
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,560
sunny bono is dead bella lugosi is dead

1165
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,340
bella lugosi's dead now he's not his son

1166
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:35,460
copernicus is dead dave copernicus never existed chas it was a myth created by the

1167
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,620
neoplatonists as well known the worst italians were fighting it out

1168
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,700
digging it out with the neoplatonics the worst italians were mathematical whiz whiz

1169
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,780
and the neoplatonists believed in love so the two of it got together and threw numbers and

1170
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,560
spittled until the world was round again as they shaved the soft peach fuzz from the outside of it

1171
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,260
and stared directly into its

1172
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,900
glazed eyes

1173
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,380
the truth became more clear than ever

1174
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,840
the neoplatonists and the aristotelians

1175
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,820
were a match made in heaven

1176
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:14,020
i almost screamed at obscenity i almost said the f do do word as loud as i could at the end of that

1177
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,160
it is after the hour that we sh**t wild

1178
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,140
that is

1179
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,920
could it ah i can only agree

1180
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,500
he said that bad word

1181
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,680
he said he came out of his mouth

1182
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,240
he opened his mouth and said

1183
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,240


1184
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,240


1185
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,040
he opened his mouth and he came right out of there

1186
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,740
and here's another line

1187
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,380
he opened that fleshy glutonous trap and out came ait

1188
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,840
big bad bones

1189
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,140
well we used to talk about wars

1190
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,640
we used to talk about economic values

1191
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,240
i was gonna say

1192
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,060
dave i got a letter from from uh uh uh

1193
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,460
a ee drunk

1194
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,800
i'm moving into the jungle man

1195
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:57,240
who said who implied that i didn't care about the war the up the non-existent upcoming war

1196
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,240


1197
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,240


1198
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,280
ever-present war.

1199
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,500
The debacle in that.

1200
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,280
Because I

1201
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,540
wasn't doing enough about it,

1202
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,040
he said.

1203
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,440
What should you do?

1204
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,180
How could we build this?

1205
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,100
I think you should sign up.

1206
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,860
Sign up, line up, and re-enlist today.

1207
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,380
That was your cry in the old days.

1208
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,060
That was my cry. That was back

1209
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,740
when I was younger than draft age.

1210
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,000
And that's when you had

1211
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,660
cut the soles off his shoes.

1212
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,140
Now that I'm beyond draft age,

1213
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,420
it is again my cry. Line up, sign up,

1214
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,120
enlist today.

1215
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,640
I believe you. I support you 100%.

1216
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,100
I saw a feel-good story.

1217
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,160
This is a wondrous

1218
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,960
feel-good story.

1219
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,040
We need feel-good stories.

1220
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,460
Really?

1221
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,860
You can tell us

1222
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,000
a feel-good story.

1223
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,700
I don't generally catch the news much,

1224
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,560
and I don't have cable.

1225
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,520
So I log on, and I think it's

1226
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,800
ABC News or CBS.

1227
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,860
Dan Rather. ABC News.

1228
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,020
I think.

1229
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,780
CBS News. I don't know. One of those two.

1230
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,300
Well, anyway, you can look at their video archives.

1231
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,380
They're conspiracy. Either way.

1232
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,700
And I looked at one, and I saw

1233
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,440
one of the video archives of a story

1234
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,420
they just run about

1235
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,000
a reunion in the desert.

1236
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,200
The banana splits.

1237
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,920
It was Dan Rather, the monkeys,

1238
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,140
and a kid, a guy, who

1239
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,020
something like nine years ago

1240
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,440
stole Dan Rather's car.

1241
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,600
Oh, I saw that. Dan embraced him,

1242
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,260
and he got down on all fours and sucked his knee.

1243
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,220
They had to turn him over.

1244
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,280
Turn the camera off and resume.

1245
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,900
Yeah, he was crying. You know, Dan Rather cries.

1246
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,600
He weeps.

1247
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,180
Kenneth is a weeper, especially when the frequencies are bad.

1248
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,640
Mmm.

1249
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,520
I heard, as I heard,

1250
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,160
the noise of thunder.

1251
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,920
One of the poor beasts sang.

1252
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,480
Come and sing.

1253
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,940
And I saw, and behold,

1254
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,860
a white horse.

1255
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,860
Hi.

1256
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,080
You hungry?

1257
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,580
Looking for a tempting treat?

1258
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,580
Hold on till I absorb some yeast.

1259
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,240
Uh-huh.

1260
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,460
Some added tang might please you, too.

1261
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,360
Uh-huh.

1262
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,280
I'll slide into an oven-fresh bonnet.

1263
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:14,960
Uh-huh.

1264
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,940
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,400
I'll take it.

1266
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,000
I'll take it.

1267
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,300
Hey, Mom.

1268
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,380
I'll take it.

1269
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,100
I'll take it.

1270
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,440
I'll take it.

1271
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,820
Yes, you.

1272
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,420
Why fuss and fret about dinner?

1273
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,020
Why not have it right here?

1274
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,100
Yes, this drive-in offers everyone in the family

1275
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,100
a real picnic treat for dinner.

1276
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,100
We've got delicious sandwiches with all the trimmings

1277
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,560
and your other dinner favorites,

1278
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,140
plus whatever you want to drink, hot or cold.

1279
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,320
Come early before the show starts

1280
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,960
or eat while you're being entertained

1281
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,920
or at intermission time.

1282
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,120
So why fuss?

1283
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,180
Give your family a tasty dinner at this drive-in.

1284
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,300
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill

1285
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,340
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

1286
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,900
for he is truly his brother's keeper

1287
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,980
and the finder of lost children.

1288
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,260
And I will strike down upon thee

1289
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,880
with great vengeance

1290
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,200
and great love.

1291
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,700
And furious anger

1292
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,400
those who attempt to poison

1293
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,180
and destroy my brother.

1294
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,080
And you will know my name

1295
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,940
is the law

1296
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,940
when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

1297
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:27,200
And I will strike down upon thee

1298
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,560
with great vengeance

1299
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:28,560


1300
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,700
Hail abnormal fortune,

1301
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:29,700


1302
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,060
all Gods of Hell,

1303
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,060


1304
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,060


1305
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,060


1306
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,060


1307
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,560
so you can stand up with me at the moment occurring.

1308
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:42,760
things we need to do,

1309
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,340
or possibly not give,

1310
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,480
Natomiast that's not the.

1311
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,700
Pension Bimco.

1312
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,780
And Jennifer says those tools are definitely those tools.

1313
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,420
Now, do you know how to play Make Your Move?

1314
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,280
No, I don't.

1315
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,460
You put this under the two numbers and the price of the three numbers.

1316
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,640
Under the four numbers.

1317
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,700
Under the three numbers.

1318
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,020
And the price of the two numbers.

1319
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,120
Under the four numbers.

1320
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,020
And the decorator bed.

1321
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,040
Now you know how to play the game.

1322
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,720
I put that under the three numbers of the...

1323
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,160
That's right.

1324
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,620
Check.

1325
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,840
Three, four, three, two, four, two, three, four, four, three, two, four, two, three, four, three.

1326
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,240
Okay.

1327
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,220
Okay.

1328
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,860
Three, two, four.

1329
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,660
Now, she says the tools of the decorator bed is right.

1330
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,800
That's fascinating.

1331
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,040
Level nine.

1332
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,880
What do you want from life, George?

1333
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:47,640
Oil.

1334
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,100
What do you want from life, George?

1335
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,800
What does George want from life?

1336
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,000
George would like to be an innocent.

1337
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,380
A bystander of his own ill works.

1338
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,300
Well, there you have it.

1339
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,020
The lonesome cowboy Dave himself.

1340
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:08,520
He'd like to wash his hands of the whole thing.

1341
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,920
He's sorry now.

1342
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,560
Be able to go to sleep.

1343
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,760
Without seeing the same dead faces.

1344
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,640
I want my Apache helicopter.

1345
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,560
That's what I want on a ride.

1346
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm out there in America's headquarters.

1347
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,380
USA from the commander in chief all the way down to Mr. Wolfowitz.

1348
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,160
And all the rest.

1349
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,720
That'll come spelled and all the people that we count and rely on.

1350
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,360
Sweet dreams, weirdos.

1351
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,940
Take a deep breath.

1352
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,660
Just take a deep breath and take that duct tape.

1353
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,260
Take that duct tape.

1354
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,020
Here's what you do.

1355
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,780
Here's your survival plan, kid.

1356
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,620
You go buy some plastic sheeting and some duct tape.

1357
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,480
And you take a big piece of that plastic sheeting, wrap it around your head.

1358
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,300
Take the duct tape.

1359
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,080
Secure it.

1360
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,820
And then you literally wrap that plastic sheeting around your neck so that you can no longer breathe.

1361
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,260
And just smile and everything will be okay.

1362
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,460
You won't get the bad germ.

1363
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,500
Unless you bite through it.

1364
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,120
That's like the instant bio shield.

1365
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,140
You just take the plastic, wrap it around your head and take the duct tape and right around your neck.

1366
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,580
Well that's how they were going to take care of Osama bin Laden.

1367
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,860
They were going to take duct tape and plastic and smoke them out of those caves one by one.

1368
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,980
Gonna make him a toga out of the plastic sheetings.

1369
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,700
Togas, that's it.

1370
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,860
Take your duct tape, kid.

1371
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,840
And that plastic sheeting and fashion yourself a nice little toga.

1372
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,620
Nothing on Elsa besides your plastic sheeting toga.

1373
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,660
And walk down to the protest march down in public square and protest the war in your plastic...

1374
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,380
Uh...

1375
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,020
And duct tape toga.

1376
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,000
Set yourself on fire, man!

1377
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,720
I'm behind it, I'm behind it all the way!

1378
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,440
You first!

1379
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,160
Absolutely free.

1380
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,220
Till next week, keep your hat on tight.

1381
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,780
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1382
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,020
Run some cowboy d's.

1383
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,740
Happy birthday princess we are doe.

1384
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,300
The river and I them stand.

1385
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,060
My name's Chad. See y'all.

1386
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,880
These over here.

1387
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,140
Canada Dry ginger ale for life is yours.

1388
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,360
Canada Dry ginger ale for life is yours.

1389
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,280
Cavity, and Pepsi, Cola, and 7up for life.

1390
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,960
Cavities are all yours for the rest of your life.

1391
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,780
Do you have any cavities for the rest of your life?

1392
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,060
Kinda digging the rhythm.

1393
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,760
Do you have any cavities for the rest of your life?

1394
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,600
Do you have any cavities for the rest of your life?

1395
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,460
Do you have any cavities for the rest of your life?

1396
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,260
Do you have any cavities for the rest of your life?

1397
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,380
Or you can have alcohol for the rest of your life.

1398
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:55,960
Yes!

1399
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,380
13 cases of Walker Special Canadian every day.

1400
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,420
It's all yours.

1401
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,040
Alcohol is up for the rest of your life.

1402
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,500
Or, courtesy of Johnny Rodgers and the Sex Pistols,

1403
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,660
the largest safety pin in the world.

1404
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,560
This is all yours, courtesy of the two of you.

1405
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,340
You have to decide now which one would you like.

1406
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,820
Alcohol, the cavities, the safety pin, the coat,

1407
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,160
or the fashion design gown.

1408
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,180
It's a plot by the government.

1409
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,160
Yes, dear.

1410
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:21,800
Thank you.

1411
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,460
True, each of us may have different ideas

1412
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,220
as to what that future will be.

1413
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,120
But every forward outlook reminds us

1414
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,780
that all the highways of all research

1415
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,800
and all communication,

1416
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,840
all the activities of science,

1417
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,740
lead to a future of science.

1418
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,020
And that will lead us onward to better methods of doing things.

1419
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,680
With new opportunities for employment

1420
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,440
and better ways of living.

1421
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,940
As we go on, determined to unfold

1422
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,020
the constantly greater possibilities

1423
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,240
of the world of tomorrow.

1424
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,100
As we move more and more rapidly forward,

1425
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,160
penetrating new horizons

1426
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,720
in the spirit of science.

1427
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,980
And the future of science.

1428
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,260
As we go on, determined to unfold

1429
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,540
the constantly greater possibilities

1430
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:23,780
of the world of tomorrow.

1431
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,400
As we move more and more rapidly forward,

1432
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,400


1433
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,400


1434
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,660
As we move more and more rapidly forward,

1435
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,760
penetrating new horizons

1436
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:30,760
