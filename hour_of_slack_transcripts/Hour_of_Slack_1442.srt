1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
Uh, Wellman, Dennis locked me in this little box. I can't feel anything, I can't see anything, it's totally black.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,520
I have no sensation in my hands, I don't know if I'm moving or what, I'm just in this little box.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,300
He said I could talk to you, he said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help me.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,060
Oh, good, happy being Wellman. I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,680
And whatever you want, I mean anything.

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,800
Tevis, you can have Tevis, just get me out of this box, Wellman.

7
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,400
Please, no, no, don't believe what Paul told you, it's all a lie, it's all a lie.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,000
Whatever I did, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, let me out of the box, Wellman.

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,280
I can't, this is a bad show, Wellman.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,780
This is a real bad show.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,220
Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,800
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be made on radio stations and only in the city of...

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,060
Take one.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,080
Take one!

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,380
I don't want to take one.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,940
Perfect, that's all we need, it's a wrap.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,300
Strike the set, boys.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,900
And take it all down now.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,300


20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,760
Thank you.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:37,960
One particular point, it was over-pertulating on me and so I turned the master switch down.

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,060
For am I not the switch turner?

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,980
Are you not the switch master?

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,140
And is it not your razor blade which whips into the flesh of those delicate buttocks?

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,340


26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
As you say.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,760
Sing like the primal monkeys do.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm liberated.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm liberated.

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,980
His eyes are red.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,640
Look at the color of blood.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,620
Look at the changes.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,540
The carnal ape.

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,920
Filled with all the hate.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:16,180
From now on, every subgenius bat shall play Sympathy for the Devil in front of a giant dog's head painted by Jesus.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,260
It's only three chords.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,980
Don't cry.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,420
Okay, cry.

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,480
Don't cry.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,240
Okay.

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,380
This is secret puzzling evidence.

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,860
That's right.

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:39,120
Once again, secretly famous here on Paleolithio treatment coming up for those of you who really want it.

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,360
And look for the big black tube around you.

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,180
Please.

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Please.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,780
Those primitive peasants didn't believe our story.

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,600
But they believed it when the mushroom cloud blasted them off the island.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,560
And we've got to ask you about that.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,620
By the time I got to Dotstock, I asked him, why are you alive?

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,300
Oh!

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,140
Hold on to the phone.

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,080
Okay, they're a great bar.

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,540
Ah!

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:06,940
Ah!

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm scared of the way that caller.

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,040
Come on, guys.

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,860
Let's drive down Shattuck Avenue real fast.

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,600
This station's hard to steer.

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,100
Check orange light sequence two.

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,140
Yeah, well.

62
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,120
At least.

63
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,740
At least out here in space where we don't talk about nothing.

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,040
There's lots of continuity.

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,760
Check emergency override switch.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,420
Oh.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,720
More.

68
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,300
More book.

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,800
More book.

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,420
You are absolutely amazed.

71
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,620
Yeah, I know.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Want some more book?

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:36,940
I don't know.

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,100
It's got some nice big fat places you can just blast your fist right into it.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,640
Kill it!

76
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,100
Run!

77
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,400
Oh, actually.

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,200
Confucius.

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,140
The mustache longer, though.

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Confucius is the one that screwed it up for everybody.

81
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,100
Confucius.

82
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,660
Confucius was the man who changed a thousand years of Chinese patriarchy and started making

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,880
women equal.

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,340
And that was the beginning of the witch's conspiracy, friends, that now has infiltrated

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,480
even, yes, the church of the subgenius.

86
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,400
Wanna hear more about the witch's conspiracy?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,060
Confucius allows you right now to the following address.

88
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,560
Someday, uh, anti-world government of pagans will have stadiums full of Satanists.

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,720
Watching while Christians are beheaded by the thousands to the beat of songs like Sympathy

90
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,940
for the Devil by the Rolling Stones or Atlantis by Donovan.

91
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,500
And the dance is about to begin.

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,740
And there's the orchestra right over there.

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,060
They're all wearing red as well.

94
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,600
And that place looks literally aflame with that.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,660
The guillotines are falling to the beat of Sympathy for the Devil.

96
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,080
And these are very, very not only normal, but these are very high-tech guillotines,

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
says Lord Francois Guillotine.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,380
The beast 999.

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,380
The guillotine, call them the guillotine themselves, are capable of not only cutting through vast

100
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,120
amounts of very, very conical tissues, but also replacing themselves with the old onions

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,780
we have right here.

102
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,040
Friends, I have seen a satanic mixing, mixing and chopping so many of their muscles.

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I have seen a thing so beyond satanic that it looks like a jack-chick comic gone berserk.

104
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,040
I just got back from the Burning Man festival, where the...

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Oh, we're wrong.

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:26,340
We're naked devil demon women and werewolf spider bug men cavorted beneath the gibbering

107
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:38,120
moon of Gavrus, a shabrin, an evil, a rising burning flames of love and ecstasy and a whole

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,460
lot of pot smoke and beer, beer running like clear pee across the plight of the world.

109
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,460


110
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,460


111
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,460


112
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,460


113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,560
I have seen a man in a black desert floor flooding the desert with the urine of the sinners

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,980
and the cavorting demon devil werewolf spider girls.

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,840
What the hell are you talking about?

116
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,060
I just came back from Burning Man.

117
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,060
Have you heard of that famous festival?

118
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,540
All I heard about was werewolves cavorting with, you know, barnacle candles and so forth.

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,540
I like, you know, just the power of this thing.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,040
Oh, yes, my friends.

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,440
My friends.

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,440


123
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,800
I have companions at Burning Man.

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,640
Dr. Philodrumon, Ranger Philodrumon, Dr. Ray Hay, Dr. Howell, and puzzling evidence,

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,820
also known as Ranger Coyote friends.

126
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:35,100
We would cruise the playa on the motorized living room of St. Pepper Mouser.

127
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,080
Literally a living room on wheels with a bar and a bartender and a stewardess and beautiful

128
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,780
babes and a cranking stereo heard in the background.

129
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,260
And on this mighty machine, we would ride across that desert looking at the weirdest

130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,720
artworks and human beings in God's great history.

131
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:14,080
You get longer past these sound installations and sex installations and hell installations.

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,840
And you get to the end of the world.

133
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,320
You get to the end of the world.

134
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,320


135
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,320


136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,320


137
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:29,300
Friends, it's difficult to impart the pure surrealism that one felt strolling across

138
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,620
the desert floor.

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,300
Looking at the scene, it was like a cross between Fellini's satyricon, a Salvador Dali

140
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,460
painting, and some weird old Betty Boop cartoon come to life.

141
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,300


143
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,300


144
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,300


145
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,520
Man, we've met many highmukk emochs.

146
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:01,540
We, we raised Jesus giant dog's head on a ninety nine foot scaffold to compete with

147
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:01,860
that.

148
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,180
That, that cantronic burning man.

149
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,360
We projected that metal dog's head by why ask why on the hugest shadow screen any human

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,920
being has ever seen.

151
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,460
And-

152
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,180
He doesn't come out with a traversing body.

153
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,280
Me?

154
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,620
What?

155
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,320
And friends, I stayed up all night long cranking with them kids.

156
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,620
I put them kids to bed, didn't I?

157
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,560
Man, I was raving with those youngsters till sun up on the playa.

158
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
They were there.

159
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,120
After they burned the man and after they did the giant opera of naked babes

160
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,400
and the giant thing going into the giant hole.

161
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
A giant thing went into a giant hole?

162
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,600
Showing all the...

163
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,980
I wanted to be a part of something like that for so long, Dr. Jerry.

164
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,900
Love it on the playa.

165
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,200
I was still out there, jump banging back and forth like an old chimpanzee listening to...

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,340
Like an old private policeman hired by some neo-fascist state.

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,180
Like the Ernie Kovacs.

168
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,840
We were free of the corporate...

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,540
State for one week.

170
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,900
But you were not free of the corporate stench which had lingered.

171
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,380
Sort of.

172
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,980
The man was there.

173
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,580
There was the burning man.

174
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,600
There was the man-man.

175
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,760
And then there was...

176
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,120
You could see the man.

177
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,760
There's my man.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,840
You could check out...

179
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,140
The man was there, though.

180
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,840
I mean, fleeting glimpses of the old trench coat behind the non-existent booth.

181
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
Puzzling evidence.

182
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Was the man.

183
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,440
And he was...

184
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,020
Yes, he was.

185
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,640
He was Ranger Coyote.

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,280
And he would drive up in his cop car with his cop out...

187
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,100
Ranger...

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
You know, Black Rock Ranger.

189
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,440
With the action rockets strapped to the roof.

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
And he'd go,

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,080
Hey, do you have a license for that art car that's blowing fire out the front?

192
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
Uh, where's that string?

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,180
Is that string up his ass?

194
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,660
Oh.

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,740
With a smile.

196
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,660
See, all the guys...

197
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,800
This is the big thing, folks.

198
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,200
If you're in California, Nevada, you must have a transvestite sort of cachet to your uniform.

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Or slip or put pink stuff on your little...

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,100
I've noticed that that's a real big deal.

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,420
Yeah.

202
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,980
That's a show.

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,900
What a man you are.

204
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
Two years ago, it was flame twirling, which, of course, the...

205
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh.

206
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,340
They're still doing.

207
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,700
Yeah.

208
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,860
Two years before that, it was piercing.

209
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,820
And two years before that, it was...

210
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,500
Bob.

211
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,300
Tattooing.

212
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,900
Tattooing.

213
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,380
Was.

214
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,260
Before that.

215
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,040
And now, see, I'm hoping that we get into, you know, cut strips, weave the skin like

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,800
you would leather.

217
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,140
Nice.

218
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,540
So then that will heal, and you'll have, like, this strange mosaic.

219
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,500
I mean, I think body modification really has to step into that kind of serious venue now.

220
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,780
Hey, man, whatever happened to just the plain old broomstick up the ass?

221
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,140
Yeah.

222
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,740
The old...

223
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,360
Whatever happened to...

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
I still like it.

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,660
Hurry up, Team Ranger.

226
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,700
Yeah, where you going, Ranger?

227
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:59,380
Like in ancient times, when we traveled the land, through deep bush forest and hot dry

228
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,840
sand.

229
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh.

230
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,060
Burning Man.

231
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,140
Oh, it was so love-filled and ecstasy-filled, so to speak.

232
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,680
Friends, and call me Burt Man.

233
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,820
I am Burt Man.

234
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,580
Have we attained such heights?

235
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,620
What?

236
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,940
I can't hear you, lady.

237
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,460
Could you speak up?

238
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,140
I said no, I'm not.

239
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,060
Do you have a girlfriend?

240
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,620
There were cops.

241
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,200
There were...

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,100
Understand this.

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Some cops.

244
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
We didn't bring you down here to compare notes.

245
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,160
You're a...

246
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,800
You're a subjeet.

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Understand.

248
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,040
Understand.

249
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,640
Understand this.

250
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,720
Jesus is Lord!

251
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,560
Jesus is Lord!

252
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,740
Jesus is Lord!

253
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
It's not fun anymore.

254
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,340
I don't want to go.

255
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,380
I don't want to go home.

256
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,240
It's dusty and hot.

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,180
Are we there yet?

258
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,820
My friends came, but they're not really fun.

259
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,380
You'll see them in this tape.

260
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,300
They're stupid.

261
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,960
I just want to go to Ranger Heaven and talk on the radio all the time, see important things

262
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,160
like, the man will burn without you, the plier is closed.

263
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,760
Which I said today, and the guy said, really?

264
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,240
And he started to pack up his stuff.

265
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
I said, Burt, stay.

266
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,100
Burt, stay.

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll let you stay.

268
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,780
Everybody else has to leave.

269
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,860
Because I'm the Ranger.

270
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,880
I'm your mom.

271
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
We do what your mom's supposed to do.

272
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,420
But she's not here.

273
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,060
Report him to the nearest real ranger you can find.

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,800
Or just ignore him and go about your business.

275
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,020
That's all from me, Ken Hummel.

276
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,880
Enjoy yourself.

277
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,140
Are you a real ranger?

278
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,740
Little baby Burt.

279
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:32,960
No.

280
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm a bad ranger.

281
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,020
I'm going to start a renegade organization next year.

282
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,860
The Bad Rangers.

283
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,780
The Black Rock.

284
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,100
I'm going to start a renegade organization next year.

285
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


286
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


287
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


288
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


289
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


290
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


291
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


292
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


293
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,100


294
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,420
Oh my God.

295
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,720
Oh my God.

296
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,420
Oh.

297
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:49,760
Oh my God.

298
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:49,760


299
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,580
Friends, if you can imagine the sight of gigantic propane cannons looking, literally looking

300
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,500
like atom bombs going off in the night in the desert as we stood from the crow's nest

301
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,620
of the motorized living room looking at 30,000 people wearing those neon green Siloom light

302
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,080
sticks around their necks.

303
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Yes, yes, yes, friends.

304
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:26,720
I would wake up in the morning in our RV and look outside and look around at the sights.

305
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,540
I'll be right here.

306
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,300
And I would think, how long have I been asleep?

307
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,780
A thousand years?

308
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,360
Is this the future or the past?

309
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,740
I'll be right here.

310
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,500
Oh, I am.

311
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,080
Death, you've been asleep.

312
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


313
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


314
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


315
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


316
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


317
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


318
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,100


319
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,100


320
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,140
You could only see what these eyes have seen.

321
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,660
It looks like you, yeah, there are no eyes.

322
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,740
It looks like your pupils are like this, like translucent orbs and stuff.

323
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,040
I bet they are.

324
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm still, I have not yet repaired my cameras, nor my eyeballs and mind.

325
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Did you make sure to shave the sphincter muscle the way dad taught his son?

326
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,940
God, this has been such a fine year.

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,460
Did you shave it the way that mom and I both instructed you back when you were a little

328
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,140
teeny boy?

329
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,080
X, X, X, X, day, and day.

330
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,080


331
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm finally Burning Man and we get to do it all again next year.

332
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,780
Until the world ends.

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,740
And friends, this is a hell of a party as the world draws to a close in the year 2001.

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,200
And God darn heck it, they know how to party out there at that Burning Man thing.

335
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,040
It, it, it's kind of expensive.

336
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,920
How many does it cost for one human unit?

337
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,040
200 souls.

338
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,800
100 souls per squad, mom.

339
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,620
To get to burn your soul.

340
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,480
But we're going to start our own rival RV.

341
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,600
We're going to start our own rival RV.

342
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,060
We're going to start our own rival RV.

343
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,120
Uh, uh, uh.

344
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
We're going to get right to the point.

345
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,760
Rivalry.

346
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,900
We're going to get right out there a week earlier, before Burning Man, out on the Black

347
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,660
Rock Desert, we will start holding a new festival called Naked Woman.

348
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,140
Well, no, that was not the funny one, which has been blotted out of existence, which I

349
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,800
thought of many, many times before.

350
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,640
And now it's just totally gone.

351
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,900
So I'm going to leave it there as a painful, painful lack of memory.

352
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,280
Just leave it out there on the desert.

353
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,780
A pile of ash that has to be cleaned up.

354
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,940
It might have been Drowning Woman, but I think it could never be so specious an orgon.

355
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,060
The Overmen and Bob Dobbs were there.

356
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:33,560
Friends, friends, I return from Burning Man with renewed optimism for the fate of humanity,

357
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,180
as well as a reinforced faith that our X-Day Drill events are kind of on the right track.

358
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,740
Uh, uh, uh.

359
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,680
There were so many similarities, friends.

360
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
They had 30,000 people.

361
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,420
We have 300.

362
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,720
They burn a giant wooden man and other giant artworks, and we burn a life-size Bob or some

363
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,700
person on a cross with all our credit cards and family Bibles and things.

364
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,740
They have like a mutant fashion show narrated by Dr. Howell, and we have our mutant prom

365
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,600
and fetish ball, uh, narrated by...

366
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
Nicky and Popus Lilith.

367
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,840
They have a naked slip and slide, and so do we.

368
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,580
They have a naked blood opera.

369
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,660
A blood opera, my friends, with 100 beautiful naked fire chicks, and we have naked blood

370
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,860
wrestling with 10 naked fire chicks.

371
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,060
But, uh, if we've got 30...

372
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,680
They've got...

373
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,420
We've got 30, um, art rockets.

374
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,060
They've got 30 art cars.

375
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Uh, they have burning hot days and freezing cold nights.

376
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,060
And so do we, dear friends.

377
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,400
They have dust storms and rain storms, and we have tornadoes and rain storms.

378
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,860
They have 200 state troopers, and we have one state trooper, and so forth and so on,

379
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,220
friends.

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:05,600
But, and while only 10% of their people are subgeniuses, at X Day, 100% are subgeniuses.

381
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,820
And friends from atop...

382
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:08,820


383
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,360
What?

384
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,720
It's Doctors.

385
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,200
It's Doctors.

386
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,960
We're Doctors.

387
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,780
We're Doctors for Bob.

388
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,580
Friends, there were Doctors everywhere.

389
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
It was like a...

390
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,300
It was where...

391
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,760
It was like so many unsaved subgeni, and yet many were saved.

392
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,480
All the way in and all the way out is alien sex, baby.

393
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:38,280
There was a live, open, open, uh, sexual bonoboisticism of, uh, of an amazing kind, friends.

394
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,560
You people have a permit for all this?

395
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:40,780
I don't.

396
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:40,800
I don't.

397
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


399
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


400
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


401
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


402
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


403
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


404
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


405
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


406
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


407
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


408
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


409
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


410
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


411
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:40,800


412
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:40,860


413
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,220
I don't.

414
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,220


415
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,560
Frilliness.

416
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,060
Let me see your frill permit.

417
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,260
So, we just passed what?

418
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,180
Five o'clock and sex drive.

419
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,280
So, I want to know, if something comes up on our radio net about the, the, the sheriff

420
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,480
going crazy at five o'clock and sex drive.

421
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,660
We have the evidence.

422
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,720
We have seen it.

423
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,740
Seen him standing there.

424
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,580
We saw the beginning of the incident.

425
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,320
We're just going to go to the central campus because I get free coffee or tai chi or tea

426
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
or any of that stuff.

427
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,840
Like, like any cop, you know, gets the coffee.

428
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,840


429
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,840


430
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,840


431
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,840


432
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,840


433
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,700
goes exactly exactly you know what happened this morning at about 8 30 i was in central camp

434
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,200
drinking coffee and a guy came in with 20 boxes of glazed donuts chocolate donuts powdered donuts

435
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,160
and all of us your officer friendly and i felt man all i need now is a little nightstick

436
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,660
and a little gun and a little siren on my hat

437
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:42,840
hippie shaving camp that's a they've got a lot of business hippie shaving camp who's shaving

438
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,620
goddamn hippies this is any person's shower unit puzzling evidence was up and philo drummond were

439
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,820
policemen at burning man that's the kind of city black rock city becomes like brigadoon once a year

440
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,640
this land brings the land of the dead

441
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,920
lightly magic and come behind the tent and tight and for everyone here there's a corresponding like

442
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,400
for instance there there was a lonely cow person david get out of here and and a charles of a

443
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,980
charles smith and there was alternate semi-connected characters which you can't fit

444
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,680
into your mind still because you're more curious about the famous band get off of it driven

445
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,460
a church of of dawn and so forth it was like a perfect that everything that we

446
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,720
We do in our bizarre cultish things.

447
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,960
They do, only they do it jacked up times a thousand.

448
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,540
Perhaps your own anti-world.

449
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,920
So if we have ten beautiful naked babes wrestling at X-Day,

450
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,240
they have ten thousand naked babes juggling fire at Burning Man.

451
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh, man, we just can't compete.

452
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,260
If we've got one motorized art car that looks like something out of Road Warrior,

453
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
they've got a fleet of them.

454
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,440
And it's every rich yuppie dot communist in San Francisco.

455
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,040
Mr. McBoing Boing, why don't we, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you,

456
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,280
but why can't we do something like this just on the spur of a moment?

457
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,020
We can't.

458
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,880
It's the situation.

459
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,400
You can't do it in your backyard.

460
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,740
And the police will come and kill you.

461
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,720
That's the only drawback because of the conspiracy of the normal people.

462
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,300
Well, we have to learn to work around living in a police state.

463
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,900
We have to learn to enjoy it.

464
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,340
Perhaps there's some motives.

465
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Perhaps.

466
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
Perhaps some avenue or venue.

467
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,960
Well, we have to have our own police and our own state.

468
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,340
And they must be fully accredited so the real police don't come and bother us.

469
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,200
Good luck.

470
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,480
And they must be also highly armed in case the real police really come.

471
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
And then they must, well.

472
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,380
Well, if you build your own Amsterdam, they come and put you in jail.

473
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,400
If you build your own ship, it will probably explode on the launch pad,

474
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,980
knowing the people we're talking about.

475
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,600
If you build your own famous hero sandwich,

476
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,980
you're going to be a rich mongrel and a policeman forever.

477
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,620
I mean, just think about all the policemen we've stirred into the mix tonight.

478
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,400
If you'll just do the one thing the conspiracy wants you to do,

479
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,080
then you can be a millionaire.

480
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,920
All you have to do is give up.

481
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,220
Just give up.

482
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,100
Just give up and face, you know, be practical.

483
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,360
Be practical.

484
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,820
Get a, you know, get the right kind.

485
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,560
Work your way up in the company.

486
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,720
And actually, you know, there's nothing wrong with working your way up in the company.

487
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,280
If you can learn to.

488
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,040
What company?

489
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,520
Kiss the art, the fine art, the zen-like art of butt kissing.

490
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
What company do you?

491
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,020
Without actually.

492
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,300
Have you been in the company of spirits?

493
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,680
Sooner or later, they will defecate on your face.

494
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,640
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

495
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,160
In a perfect world.

496
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,960
And it's you, not the former D.

497
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,520
So the district supervisor calls me in and puts the old white schmaltz down on me.

498
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,120
And I will.

499
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,300
I will go back to the office, to the meeting.

500
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:20,680
The meeting of the other new and potentially significant contributors to the corporal world of communications.

501
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,780
And the psychological world of how to get ahead by.

502
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,260
Kissing butt.

503
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,740
Butt.

504
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,100
By not actually letting the lips of the kisser.

505
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,040
Kisser.

506
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,720
Touch the butt of the kissy.

507
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,700
Yes.

508
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,160
By providing the illusion.

509
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,640
That the actual kisser's lips are indeed.

510
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,580
Kissing and touching.

511
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,060
I mean, the molecules themselves are one.

512
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,740
On the point of contact with the kissy's butt.

513
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,860
But.

514
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,160
But.

515
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,780
In this case.

516
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,580
Hmm.

517
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,320
We have found out to get ahead.

518
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Ahead ahead.

519
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,960
In the corporate world.

520
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:25,440
By only using the established norms of success climbing up the ladder.

521
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,700
And how to use those norms.

522
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,720
As a, shall we say, skeleton?

523
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,820
Of whose bones you.

524
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,240
One in that position would act as if they were a ladder or some type of stairway.

525
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,720
Yes.

526
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,340
And advancing up those bones.

527
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Causing the illusion.

528
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,920
To all other.

529
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,400
Uh.

530
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,340
Entities involved in the corporate climb.

531
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,060
That the feet are actually touching the bones.

532
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,680
And the lips are actually touching the butt.

533
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,820
But we both know now that.

534
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,740
That does not necessarily ring true for.

535
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,720
A, oh say, a subgenius in that position.

536
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,420
And uh.

537
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,040
For those people we have found that the best way is to.

538
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,400
Give the illusion.

539
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,380
The zen.

540
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,500
So to speak.

541
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,240
Or per se.

542
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,660
Of uh.

543
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,080
Butt kissing.

544
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,860
And uh.

545
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,720
By doing so.

546
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,700
One can derive.

547
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,060
Said.

548
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,420
Benefits.

549
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,260
From.

550
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,780
Such action.

551
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
That one who.

552
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,560
In all sincerity was following that path.

553
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,940
With uh.

554
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,060
The utmost.

555
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,540
Uh.

556
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,280
Sincerity.

557
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,740
Uh.

558
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,840
To use that word again.

559
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,380
That one who.

560
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


561
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


562
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


563
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


564
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


565
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


566
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


567
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,380


568
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,000
Is.

569
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,000


570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,000


571
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,180
And uh.

572
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,980
By doing so.

573
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,680
Fall into the trap.

574
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,620
Pfft.

575
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,560
Yes.

576
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
By.

577
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,660
Following the illusion.

578
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,720
Conversely.

579
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,780
One can.

580
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,960
Avoid the trap.

581
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,540
But reap the benefits.

582
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,340
Ha ha.

583
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,480
And so my.

584
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,760
This concludes.

585
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,880
Our topic.

586
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,540
Of the zen of.

587
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,780
Butt kissing.

588
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
Corporate climbing.

589
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


590
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


591
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


592
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


593
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


594
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


595
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


596
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,360


597
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,720
Corporate style.

598
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,080
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

599
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,560
In a perfect world there's continuity.

600
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,360
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

601
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,460
There's no need for spontaneity.

602
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,840
Perfect system.

603
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,040
We're all brothers to the end.

604
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,900
Why?

605
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Humanity is my evil enemy.

606
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Why?

607
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,980
Cause it's not worth saving.

608
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,120
Woo.

609
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Woo.

610
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,720
Woo.

611
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,340
Woo.

612
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


613
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


614
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


615
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


616
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


617
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


618
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


619
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


620
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


621
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


622
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


623
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


624
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


625
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


626
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,340


627
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,180
Hey this is oyster everyone.

628
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:09,600
Welcome to the pararabidиваетza.org.

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,740
Join our new bajra show for maximum transparency.

630
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,320
You know it's routine.

632
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,620
benefit.

633
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,820
You know what?

634
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,620
Faster.

635
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,240
Chemical Cop Out

636
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,540
I scored this after you

637
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:24,860
Wow

638
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,680
Chemical Cop Out

639
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,420
Christmas is the hunger

640
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,640
In the seven house on the soulless gym

641
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,820
Crystal twilight

642
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,900
To turn the army psychedelic super kick

643
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,180
Chemical Cop Out

644
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,480
Lives inside a neon light

645
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,000
We're high by liquid motion

646
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,740
Paint a hazy sky

647
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
Weon can't be a public ayud

648
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,580
Can't be a cop

649
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,200
We can't be a part in a resist

650
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,440
Where young deviants

651
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,240
Ahh seen as a arab

652
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,980
Yea you saw it

653
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:38,980


654
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,100
Ever since I was seven

655
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,040
In the swamp

656
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,920
As service

657
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,140
Maybe at my detto

658
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,800
I hate bagpipes

659
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Cool.

660
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,560
Yeehaw!

661
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,440
I bet they're fake rednecks.

662
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,100
I bet they're not even real rednecks.

663
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,700
Get out of the way!

664
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,820
People out here, they don't have any respect for road rules.

665
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,520
Look at that guy, he's broke.

666
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:04,940
Road rage.

667
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,160
Just stop.

668
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,780
Yeah.

669
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,900
You guys think it's his Ranger yelling at him.

670
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,800
I don't know, should I do something?

671
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm pulling your bike license.

672
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,380
There's something happening here.

673
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,700
You don't know what it is Mr. Harvey.

674
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,340
You can't control it because it's too huge now.

675
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,500
Going too fast and the state's going to smoosh your little parade permit.

676
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,480
We're going to be interviewed on the show.

677
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,180
This is the famous Ivan Stantz who started Church of the Sub-Divine.

678
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,180
And this is the famous Philo's brother.

679
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,540
That helped us.

680
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,100
I started the Church of the Sub-Divine.

681
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,240
This guy actually started it, yeah.

682
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,660
Oh you did?

683
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,220
Yeah.

684
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,160
You're the one responsible.

685
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
Yeah, I'm the one that ripped off these, both of them.

686
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
Yeah, I gave them the idea.

687
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,480
Yeah, where's my money?

688
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Jayner's got it.

689
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,000
Where's my money?

690
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,340
Jayner's got your money, man.

691
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,100
I am home.

692
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,260
I am home.

693
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:55,980
Ahhhhh!

694
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,440
There's been no plutonium released on this site.

696
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,000
Please step away from the bicycle.

697
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,900
Everybody, everybody, at least a few meters back, please.

698
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
Entree 21.

699
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,780
Entree 21.

700
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,200
At 40, you need to step away from the bike for about a few meters.

701
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,620
At 40, you need to step away from the bike for about a few meters.

702
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:28,980
Now, Ed Strange was another person I was thinking, should be at Burning Man every year, because

703
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:36,620
it's like a thousand Ed Stranges running around, making insane fake weapons out of household

704
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,060
items.

705
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,680
Okay, now why?

706
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,780
Okay, now why?

707
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,860
kind of racist organization you're running anyway.

708
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,800
Well, speaking of frequency, when was the last time you defecated in the burning house?

709
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,600
Oh, wait a minute.

710
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,680
You're out in the middle of the Black Rock Desert burning a 150-foot effigy of a white

711
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,060
man.

712
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,400
I'd expect that from a bunch of young punks out there, but you're old enough to remember

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,800
the segregation days of the 60s when white people were forced to sit at the front of

714
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,140
the bus.

715
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,400
There's nothing better than having someone stick a screwdriver right in your frontal

716
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,680
lobes and twisting it very, very hard until they actually sweat in the armpits.

717
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,180
I think you probably could explain loads and loads and other volumes over that.

718
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,160
Come on.

719
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,640
Come on, fess up.

720
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,780
I saw a whole lot of colored people at Burning Man.

721
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:33,480
They were like blue, green, purple, scientific silver, you know, orange, blue, purple.

722
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,380
If at X Day we have a parade of, you know, 40...

723
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,520
I got those Norwegian beauties.

724
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,500
I got purple.

725
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,060
I got black.

726
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,240
I got blue.

727
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,980
I got purple.

728
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,000
I got orange.

729
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,340
I got...

730
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,020
Breast-a-sages.

731
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,460
At Burning Man, there was a parade of, like, literally a thousand breast-a-gages.

732
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,340
Breast-a-gages of our life.

733
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,020
I mean...

734
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,440
Dr. Tom, I told you.

735
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,480
What are they doing?

736
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,780
She's not going to make it through the X-Rays.

737
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,580
Why are they making more money than the Church of the Subgenius?

738
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,260
Look, Bill, I didn't want to give her an exorgasm in the first place.

739
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
An exorgasm is expensive, Thyssen.

740
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,080
We can't afford exorgasms for every woman that thinks that she's possessed by Thorns.

741
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,880
The Church of the Subgenius.

742
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,680
We'd probably make more money if it wasn't, frankly, filled with subgeniuses.

743
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,120
Well, then...

744
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,640
Frankly filled with subgeniuses?

745
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,060
You know, but that was a problem at one time the Mormons had, the Scientologists.

746
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,200
And look at them now.

747
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,680
They're visible.

748
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,740
We're invisible.

749
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:25,920
We're invisible.

750
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,180
We have to get the master of the fine art of making them work for us.

751
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:29,960
Yeah.

752
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,740
Right now, it's just us working for us.

753
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,160
Think of the wild rat party before we were terrible employees.

754
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,920
You know, think of the blues projects we used to invent before we passed out.

755
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,340
Doing the numbers, as they used to say.

756
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,460
I'm going to go flip the brain.

757
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,560
Stan, you don't need to flip the brain.

758
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,740
Come back here.

759
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,760
He's going away.

760
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,520
He's mad now.

761
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,120
A bunch of dogs.

762
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,820
He was talking about Burning Man, and he thought I was interrupting him.

763
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,220
Right, Chaz?

764
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,420
That it was personally my fault.

765
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,460
It's all your fault, Dave.

766
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,500
I thought it was a spud gun up his ass.

767
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,780
Well, you know, you didn't have to stick that thing up there so early.

768
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,900
There it be.

769
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,400
The fortress.

770
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,700
The flying Dutchman.

771
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,400
We'll get there.

772
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,520
It appears.

773
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,140
Sometimes in a different place on Earth.

774
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,180
I stag the treasures there.

775
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,660
If you be man enough to find it, argh.

776
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,440
So you believe those primitive superstitions about a treasure?

777
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
Yeah, sure, there's a treasure there.

778
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,800
We don't need no thinking back.

779
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,220
A castle of the desert, indeed.

780
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,580
A hallucination, a mirage.

781
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,520
I got a treasure right there.

782
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,580
I'll give it to you.

783
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,520
It looks like a castle in the distance.

784
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,420
It looks like some sort of structure.

785
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,980
It's a real castle with real treasure.

786
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,240
But nobody builds anything like that.

787
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,380
It's a piece of shit.

788
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,460
Come on, let's go find it.

789
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,460


790
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Look, we're traveling through an absolute whiteout.

791
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,780
It's sheer blankness in front of us.

792
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,120
It's sheer blankness.

793
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,900
And I've been in caravans where all you can see...

794
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:49,920
I tell you.

795
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,480
I tell you.

796
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,880
All you can see is like a vague shape of a car in front of you.

797
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,900
That's the last thing you see.

798
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,220
Look at those people.

799
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,920
We could kill them.

800
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,820
Nobody would even know.

801
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,500
We didn't mean to.

802
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,260
We couldn't save them.

803
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,940
Seatbelt in!

804
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,080
Seatbelt in!

805
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,320
Seatbelt in!

806
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,200
All over your windows!

807
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,460
All the windows up!

808
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,460
What's with this dust?

809
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,540
What's with the dust in all of your windows?

810
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,240
I'm getting dust in my eyes!

811
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,300
I want to go home!

812
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,280
Extinguish the window!

813
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,400
Whimps.

814
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,200
Whimps.

815
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,660
Extinguish your mirror!

816
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,920
There was a lot of dust and there was a lot of breasted edge.

817
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,320
Everybody in California has to put edge on the end of everything.

818
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,140
So it's like...

819
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,080
Man, I'm really feeling my road rage-age today.

820
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,980
Everywhere you went there was this wind and this dust.

821
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,420
And there were so many things that could break your camera or your brain.

822
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,880
Like dryness or LSD breath or sun spots or the giant lasers that covered the sky at night, friends.

823
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,700
Lasers a mile long.

824
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,660
The weird vibes could break your camera.

825
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,120
The Cyalume light stick radiation could break your camera.

826
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,720
The micro waves from the spy satellites photographing all the nakedity from above could get to you.

827
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,020
The dehydration could get to you.

828
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,560
You'd be choking on this dust and dealing with the wind and everything.

829
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,840
But there were good sides to that too.

830
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,660
By the same token, you could fart freely!

831
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,340
The wind was blowing so high that no matter what kind of a crowd you were in, it didn't matter.

832
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,240
Nobody was going to pick up on it.

833
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,460
I know you're into like real odd rare delicacies.

834
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,900
Have you ever like sampled bear crotch?

835
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,300
Uh...

836
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,900
I don't know.

837
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,960
That reminds me of some of the things I saw at that strange festival.

838
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,160
Each one does a different thing.

839
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,240
Each one does a different thing.

840
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:01,520
You know, bears and other large mammals sometimes have a bone in their reproductive organ.

841
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,820
And their pancreatic solutions are good for your hair.

842
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,460
Where humans don't.

843
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
And like subgenius animals.

844
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,440


845
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,680
The bear has a bone.

846
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,220
Right.

847
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,140
I wouldn't call them humans.

848
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,960
But it's not a real bone.

849
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,220
It's more like a near cartilage, Dr. Fuzzby used to say.

850
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,520
The near cartilage of the subgenius phallus is very, very engorged now.

851
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,840
And can replicate an entire race in one fell swoop.

852
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,360
Under subgenius orgasm is like a cross between a violent sneeze and a balloon popping.

853
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,380
A multigasm, as some have called it at the institute in Vienna.

854
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,920
We have also taken extra care to mess with these multigasms.

855
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,280
And poking a little needle here and a little needle there to make them more exciting.

856
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,140
Strange.

857
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,840
They had an actual functioning thunder dome at Burning Man.

858
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,580
Where mighty men hang.

859
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,060
And women.

860
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,580
Great big giantess women, what I saw.

861
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,380
There's nothing right here than a mighty woman.

862
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:04,200
Hanging from bungee cords with giant bats beating on each other while Norwegian death rock band music is played.

863
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,040
I mean it wasn't all peace and love.

864
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,520
There was death and destruction.

865
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,060
Art cars that blow fire battling each other in the desert.

866
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:23,160
It was like the grooviness of a thousand twisted chemical inverse mania.

867
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,520
When it comes to grace and beauty.

868
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,120
A silent dark of a siren that beat the soul rotating plane.

869
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,160
Stranger than object in edge.

870
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,380
The reamer comes bound to chain.

871
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,820
Chemical compound lives inside a neon light.

872
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,140
Where half a liquid motion paints a hazel sky.

873
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,920
Chemical compound.

874
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,580
Just a chemical compound.

875
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,580
Boss man.

876
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,460
Ooh yeah.

877
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,200
Chemical compound.

878
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,820
Just a chemical compound.

879
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:31,120
A silent dark of a siren that beat the soul rotating plane.

880
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,120
Tranquilizer flower junket.

881
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,060
Lost in a turn-laced domain.

882
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,660
Chemical compound lives inside a neon light.

883
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,000
Where half a liquid motion paints a hazel sky.

884
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,840
Chemical compound.

885
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,480
Just a chemical compound.

886
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,540
Boss man.

887
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,420
Ooh yeah.

888
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,140
Chemical compound.

889
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,700
Just a chemical compound.

890
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:15,720
Friends, I met so many wonderful subgeniuses that we had never encountered before out there.

891
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,700
The giant dobbs heads we were toting around lured them.

892
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,940
Bob himself was always one jump ahead of us.

893
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,800
We could never catch up to him.

894
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,960
But, uh, God, there were some scroogeous, there were real superheroes, friends.

895
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,840
Real superheroes.

896
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:37,440
My new hero, Megavolt, would drive through the crowds on top of this gigantic truck,

897
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:47,540
which was mounted, it was mounted with huge Van der Graaf generators that must have been pounding thousands of billions of megavolts through him.

898
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,500
Oh, here comes Megavolt's truck coming around the bend now.

899
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,300
Listen to those incredible discharges of electricity.

900
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:17,260
This guy would stand inside of a suit, a thick space suit, holding things like, people would pass up to him VCRs and TVs, and he would hold them up to these incredible voltages, and, and, and, you'd watch the shrieking electricity rip through the, uh, the objects of the man.

901
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,280
There he is.

902
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,460
Rocky Megavolt is coming through.

903
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,140
Megavolt is a real hero.

904
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,340
The mutants are among us, my friends.

905
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,600
Thank you.

906
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,420
Please speak to us.

907
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,560
Megavolt, Megavolt, make way for the treasured airframe.

908
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,440
Get fully charged!

909
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,040
Megavolt, my friends, beware!

910
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,900
All criminals and pink boys for Megavolt will come and get you!

911
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,980
Get charged!

912
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Megavolt, Megavolt is all powerful.

913
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:43,720
Woo!

914
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,380
Woo!

915
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,300
Woo!

916
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,820
Woo!

917
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,000
Woo!

918
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,420
Woo!

919
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,680
Oh, friends, oh, friends, oh, friends, you can't imagine.

920
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,560
Mark Farrell!

921
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,000
Mark Farrell!

922
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,140
Don't you want?

923
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,320
You want?

924
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,000
You go turn their damn cult, then.

925
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,300
Quit and leave!

926
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,280
You know, you know, well, what we've got to do...

927
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,640
I'm tired of hearing you whine about how much better the other guy is.

928
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,640
No, no, it's not that.

929
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:16,960
Actually, we, Bob Dobbs and Bob's called ministers made a hell of a showing, and I couldn't sell

930
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,660
too, save too many souls, because it seemed like every other person there knew who Bob

931
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,080
was.

932
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,760
He was going to make us wait until after D, where we were supposed to pick up a third

933
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,460
bunch of princesses, so we were not going to be here.

934
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,580
We were going to be here until after D, where we were supposed to pick up a third bunch

935
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,580


936
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:35,540
Once again, yeah, I'll tell you what, we need to just lead a huge caravan of our kind in there to show those people how to do it all night.

937
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,920
Because most of them, hell, I'm a 49,000 year old man and I outlasted most of them bum kids.

938
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,100
It's a flashback.

939
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,640
It's like we've gained some knowledge.

940
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
It's how to build big, stupid things.

941
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,320
Which, of course, Burning Man is all about.

942
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,900
Building big, stupid things.

943
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,080
I was scrapping around San Francisco and light a man on fire.

944
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,600
It was no more meditative than that.

945
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,140
It's a flashback.

946
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,880
We're going right for the top.

947
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,680
It's been a total puzzle.

948
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,020


949
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,660
Just a total puzzle.

950
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,180
Yes, baby, and we're on the mobile living room.

951
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,620
You could even be on TV.

952
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,420
This guy named...

953
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,400
Chuck Serino has this amazing playa theater television whereby you could...

954
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,220
He could make a show in the daytime and project it on a giant theater at night.

955
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,820
And the show was made on the back of the motorized living room.

956
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,380
At least the interview with...

957
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,840
You're extremely revered.

958
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,380
I would say Dr. Philodrum and Ray Hay, which happened...

959
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,160
Welcome to camera.

960
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,720
Talk show, camp show.

961
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,760
The year is 2000.

962
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,000
We're at Black Rock City.

963
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,320
What a great show.

964
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,020
What a great day.

965
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,440
He's up there.

966
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,260
What a great day.

967
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,700
What a fine, fine day.

968
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,600
And what a fine, fine studio.

969
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,720
You see, has anyone seen this man?

970
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,660
That's the main reason...

971
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,080
Oh, look at Bob.

972
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,640
Look at him.

973
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,080
Is that Bob?

974
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,540
Has anyone seen this?

975
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,540
Have you seen him?

976
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,740
We're sure that Bob Dobbs is at Burning Man.

977
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,460
Bob?

978
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,460
Really?

979
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,980
He's definitely at Burning Man.

980
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,980
Since Bob can't be with...

981
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,120
physically, I think we need to channel him.

982
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,580
I think you're right.

983
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,680
We'll have to wait a little while.

984
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,540
Father, do you need some...

985
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,340
Friends, here's the problem.

986
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,840
You got people who are always going,

987
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,720
well, I want to hear Bob talk.

988
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,300
I want to see what the hell's going on with Bob.

989
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,940
I want to lean on Bob.

990
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,520
I want Bob to be my crutch.

991
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,080
My friend, this is not the crutch of the sub-division.

992
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,740
If you are going to be some kind of...

993
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,900
You're supposed to be Bob's crutch.

994
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,300
You don't ask what goes in Bob's crutch.

995
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,820
You don't be asking what Bob's smoking in his...

996
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,080
You throw yourself into Bob's pipe, damn it!

997
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,640
Don't let him smoke you!

998
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,160
Let Bob smoke you!

999
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,700
And then you'll understand!

1000
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,120
I can feel...

1001
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,280
I can feel the magic.

1002
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,940
They'll find me when they pry me out of my cold dead finger!

1003
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,400
Ivan!

1004
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:18,980
Ivan!

1005
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,660
I understand you brought a...

1006
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:20,800
Hey!

1007
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,700
What makes you scream like that?

1008
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,320
We're going to roll that grip!

1009
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,360
Good.

1010
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,740
That's the way we've always operated this church.

1011
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,640
Not that we ever let anybody rip us off.

1012
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,320
Get your hand away from the gun.

1013
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,180
By God, you know, by Jesus Christ,

1014
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,300
and I spend half our time pursuing trademark violations these days.

1015
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,060
People who would steal the visage of Bob

1016
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,340
and use it for filthy lucre

1017
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,720
and the pursuit of mammon.

1018
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,500
His head was changing now, too.

1019
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,780
The evil, filthy money

1020
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,780
that doesn't go in Bob's wallet.

1021
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,360
Or mine.

1022
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,120
Or the church's.

1023
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,600
People like me.

1024
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,680
God darn it.

1025
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,340
You know, that was one other thing

1026
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,620
that was kind of communistic

1027
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,100
about that Burning Man thing.

1028
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,300
They allow no vending,

1029
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,740
no selling,

1030
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,960
no money at all.

1031
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Only barter.

1032
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,960
It's like barter town in that Thunderdome.

1033
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,120
Can you get anything you want there?

1034
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,780
And they call it.

1035
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,420
They can call it.

1036
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,040
Money?

1037
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,220
Number nine?

1038
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,800
Can you get anything you want?

1039
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,580
Anything you want there?

1040
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,560
Turn me on, Deadman.

1041
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,180
I very bad.

1042
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,060
Oh, Bob is dead.

1043
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,840
We smell sausage.

1044
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,640
Do you dread your grandfather?

1045
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,640
Do you dread your grandfather?

1046
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,200
We smell bad.

1047
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,380
It's all slimy.

1048
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,520
Bad, bland, and silly.

1049
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,080
Stan, do you dread your grandfather?

1050
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:43,980
Huh?

1051
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,180
Do you dread your grandfather?

1052
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,600
I do dread my grandfather.

1053
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,440
In a sort of number nine-ish way.

1054
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,320
Yeah.

1055
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,400
pessoas com a minh.

1056
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,440
We're not going to let him meet another parfait ngày,

1057
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:58,540
because when termР

1058
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,320
the signet Mobile

1059
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,000
are the time you sit down

1060
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


1061
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


1062
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,760
with Asmaca.

1063
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,360
God as a man,

1064
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,940
to get your her human trying to to get

1065
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,940
aordon-cowsel ring.

1066
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,120
You can buy my rap track.

1067
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,980
Is that all right?

1068
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,100
10 or 14 minutes or something to get a-

1069
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,740
ultimately a pattern of wiggles.

1070
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,620
Wiggles of nothingness, or

1071
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,420
of

1072
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,320
four

1073
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,580
comprehensible dimensions

1074
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,080
and six really

1075
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,600
completely insane ones.

1076
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,040
I'm glad to hear you made that trip out there to the desert.

1077
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,660
Oh, yes,

1078
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
dear friends, it was slack, slack,

1079
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,280
slack.

1080
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,860
Just wandering around

1081
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,500
with dragging my jaw

1082
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,140
on the ground, you might say.

1083
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,120
Staring at the

1084
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,340
strange sights

1085
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,400
around. I was out in the middle of

1086
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,360
the dryness in the desert when

1087
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,180
this amazing caravan

1088
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,300
comes pulling up

1089
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,680
covered with mermaids

1090
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,920
and hauling behind it

1091
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,280
this

1092
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,980
I can't, it's hard to describe, but it was like

1093
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,440
a clear plastic

1094
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,660
suit filled with

1095
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,040
water in which was suspended

1096
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,680
a floating man

1097
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,300
and

1098
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,580
and that's when I heard this voice

1099
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,940
come up through the desert

1100
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,560
broadcast from this caravan.

1101
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,780
And you need to embrace the wetness

1102
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,140
and embrace the moisture while there is still time

1103
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,720
before the dryness has time to take you over entirely

1104
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,280
and leave you a pile of powder

1105
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,920
blowing in the desert wind.

1106
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,600
Waterboy can kill you.

1107
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,160
Waterboy can save you.

1108
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,360
Waterboy can moisten you to your core.

1109
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,220
Live wet or die!

1110
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,120
You don't need to be afraid of Waterboy.

1111
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,560
Waterboy is a friendly needy.

1112
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,020
He surrounds himself with beautiful mermaids.

1113
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,860
Waterboy is extremely well hugged and totally voiced.

1114
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,060
Waterboy has come to wet you down.

1115
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Waterboy has come to boicing you up.

1116
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,800
Embrace the wetness and denounce the dryness

1117
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,680
and Waterboy has

1118
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,100
Embrace the moisture!

1119
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,840
Run out to a dryway!

1120
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,680
I'm pretty sure that was

1121
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,740
Penn Jillette, friends of Penn and Teller.

1122
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,120
Don't you think? Listen back to that type of news!

1123
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,980
Don't you tell me you don't think that was...

1124
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,260
And I got into a conversation with Jack Webb, friends.

1125
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,560
There was a place called The Web Site.

1126
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,000
Uh...

1127
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Which was, uh...

1128
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,200
It had this model, sort of a life-size Jack Webb.

1129
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,040
And it spoke to you.

1130
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,920
It was interactive.

1131
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,360
I think it had a brain somewhere that would relate to you.

1132
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,760
And I got in kind of an argument with it.

1133
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,900
We weren't talking about marijuana.

1134
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,760
We still are.

1135
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,120
Marijuana is the flame.

1136
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,140
Heroin is the fuse.

1137
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,260
LSD is the bomb.

1138
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,040
Isn't that a subjective judgment, Jack?

1139
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,760
You're a loser.

1140
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,380
LSD is the bomb.

1141
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,840
Let's talk about last night.

1142
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,400
Oh, I mean, not in front of everybody here.

1143
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,340
Come on, Jack.

1144
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,500
Maybe you'd like to tell us now what really happened last night.

1145
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:01,860
Jack?

1146
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
You don't want everybody else to...

1147
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,480
I mean, come on.

1148
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,420
It was great, but...

1149
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,720
I mean, it's not something to talk about.

1150
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,860
This time I want the truth.

1151
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,680
Okay, okay, it was great, Jack.

1152
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,360
Oh, fuck.

1153
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,360
Oh, fuck, man.

1154
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,420
Did you go and repair a car for a woman by the name of Maria Aruba?

1155
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,040
Look, Maria's my...

1156
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,000
She's cool, okay?

1157
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,720
Maria's...

1158
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,840
She didn't have anything to do with it.

1159
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,320
Is that so?

1160
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,120
Go ahead.

1161
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,660
Arrest me.

1162
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,200
Take me in.

1163
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,260
I don't want to talk about it.

1164
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,220
I don't want to tell what she...

1165
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:33,280
All right, son.

1166
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,680
What is it?

1167
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:33,840
Speed?

1168
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,440
Bennis?

1169
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,940
What are you on?

1170
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,260
Bennis.

1171
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,480
All right, son.

1172
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:37,880
What is it?

1173
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,220
Speed?

1174
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,620
Bennis?

1175
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,160
What are you on?

1176
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,440
And mace.

1177
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,980
Is that why your boyfriend needed money?

1178
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,900
To support your health?

1179
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,300
Clorox.

1180
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,560
And some...

1181
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:53,860
A little bit of acid and some downers and some...

1182
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,800
Is that right?

1183
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,500
Say mace and PCP, angel dust.

1184
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,760
Muggles, boo.

1185
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,420
Is that right?

1186
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,620
Sure, man.

1187
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,780
Hey, come on, dude.

1188
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,680
Get with it.

1189
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,200
So, Jack, you're going to be a cop?

1190
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1191
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1192
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1193
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1194
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1195
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,200


1196
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,580
I'm going to turn you on in the grass in the pilt.

1197
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,960
Bob, man.

1198
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,760
Bob turned me on, dude.

1199
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,860
You're a liar.

1200
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,120
No, man.

1201
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,620
Bob is the truth.

1202
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,540
Bob...

1203
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,480
Bob...

1204
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,920
Well, Bob wants you.

1205
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,700
God loves you, Jack, but Bob wants you.

1206
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,980
You're a liar.

1207
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,500
But it's not all reality of mine, Jack.

1208
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,880
But with marijuana, the whole purpose is to get so high you don't know who or what you

1209
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,060
are.

1210
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,100
Son, no matter how you slice that, that's dangerous.

1211
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,360
Praise Bob!

1212
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,200
You're a liar.

1213
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,380
I plead insanity, sir.

1214
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,060
It's in...

1215
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,380
I only know one last question.

1216
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,040
I want you to think carefully about what I'm gonna ask you now.

1217
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:54,960
Yes sir.

1218
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,280
I want you to think carefully about what I'm gonna ask you now.

1219
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,940
Yes sir.

1220
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,460
Yes.

1221
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,020
Okay.

1222
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,300
Have you ever cop blazed up before?

1223
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,120
Cop flazed up before.

1224
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,380
Cop blazed up, cop blazed up before.

1225
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,420
My dad was a cop, too.

1226
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:06,420


1227
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:06,480
So, I'm going to call you Jack.

1228
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,480


1229
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,340
Let's quit for the night, I'm getting bored.

1230
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,160
Can't beat me, I don't scream.

1231
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,660
See you later.

1232
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,880
Frank's bald.

1233
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,800
See you later.

1234
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,600
Watch out!

1235
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,360
I'm not here to give you reasons to leave Burning Man, no.

1236
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,920
I'm here to give you reasons to stay.

1237
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,220
Like for instance, here at Burning Man all the Altoids are pungent and refreshing

1238
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:38,600
and certainly not dosed with a potent blend of lysergic acid diethylamide mixed with elephant tranquilizer and methamphetamine.

1239
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,900
How preposterous.

1240
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:46,340
Why if such a thing were true, hundreds if not thousands of you would have already ingested that brain-frying narcotic cocktail.

1241
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,400
Any minute you might freak out, choke on your own tongues or even fall into a coma.

1242
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,060
And no one falls into a coma at Burning Man.

1243
00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:02,120
Another good reason to stay here at Burning Man is that all the new people with whom you're having sex are guaranteed to be 100% STD free.

1244
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,720
STD stands for sexually transmitted disease and those vivid oozing blisters speckling your groin right now can't possibly be one of those.

1245
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,060
It must be heat rash.

1246
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,620
Nope, there's nothing to worry about.

1247
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,500
Hey, why not get some coffee over at the cafe?

1248
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,720
It's piping hot and totally free of ground glass and feces.

1249
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,240
And hey, while you're wandering around with that coffee don't forget to look up and appreciate those fabulous lasers overhead.

1250
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:32,200
Isn't it great that they aren't deadly and that Larry Harvey isn't planning to suddenly train them on every major theme camp in Black Rock Valley?

1251
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,040
Neatly severing people's heads at the neck and leaving their lifeless torsos to twitch and spill blood into the plier.

1252
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,720
I think so.

1253
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,820
So forget about the boy or girlfriend you left back home.

1254
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
The one who's cheating with a mailman right now.

1255
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:50,540
Forget about pointless conveniences like air conditioning, clean toilets, fresh sushi and laundered underwear.

1256
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,860
Forget about the co-worker who's putting in overtime to ensure that he gets the promotion and you get the sack.

1257
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,300
It all pales in comparison to the risk-free fun at Burning Man.

1258
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,700
Doesn't it?

1259
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,180
Yeah.

1260
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,840
This has been Tokyo Recup with the transmission.

1261
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,480
Disappear and bring the concealed antibiotics of your own physical body.

1262
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,160
...consistency of feature.

1263
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,520
We can carve off chunks of you for a snack with those log pipes and the alligator...

1264
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:27,480
You know, I saw an old... you'd see old naked people that look like they've been in the sun their whole lives.

1265
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,100
Like old chimpanzees. Naked old chimpanzees wandering...

1266
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,380
...in the armpits.

1267
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,600
...flat-jawed across the desert...

1268
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,760
Hanging a mirror around everything.

1269
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,320
...near the old skullcappy.

1270
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,760
Oh, I know what you're... I know what you mean.

1271
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,720
...and this one's kind of moist and...

1272
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,900
I'm working on it. I will become...

1273
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,640
...spinning its tongue...

1274
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,160
...primoanthropocus.

1275
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,980
...the bottle of bottle of bottle of bottle of...

1276
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,100
The pre-man. The pure yeti.

1277
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:48,660
...the fine yeti.

1278
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,640
That's why you go out into the desert to purge yourself and pee clear.

1279
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,140
I must purge myself.

1280
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,740
I think about it. There is no...

1281
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,840
...snack with a little weasel around...

1282
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,920
...or human adaptation that's more useful than in, like, shoe leather.

1283
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,160
Shoes? What do shoes have to do with this?

1284
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,260
There are some iguana humanoids out there, but there were so many purdy...

1285
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,660
...Purdy iguanas.

1286
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,200
...Purdy... There weren't... Actually, there was too many of those skinny types, but it...

1287
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,460
But...

1288
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,640
They're real skinny, like, apid vapid fairy, you know, hippie types.

1289
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,720
Oh, the kind, like...

1290
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,000
With more hair than physical rest.

1291
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,460
...beautiful naked MTV babes.

1292
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,620
Oh, none of those large, juggy women, though, right?

1293
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,100
Oh, conspiracy, you know, playboy-looking...

1294
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,180
No? Yes? No?

1295
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,920
I have no... I use... I know nothing of these...

1296
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,080
I think a certain amount of...

1297
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,380
...supermodels...

1298
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,500
...flashing... not flashing...

1299
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:37,920
...you kind of shame...

1300
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,000
...fecundity is in order. I'm not...

1301
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,500
...or ugly.

1302
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,680
...I'm not one of those big boy women myself.

1303
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,640
Yeah, but...

1304
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,480
...but I think a woman should have some...

1305
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,440
No, they're not all going to have to do...

1306
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,700
...to die.

1307
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,900
...fecund things going on.

1308
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,920
Not those who have joined up with the men and women of Bob.

1309
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,680
Oh, the minnows of Darth.

1310
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,180
Okay.

1311
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:53,880
I'm with you.

1312
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,500
Darth?

1313
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:54,920
Oh, Darth.

1314
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,520
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1315
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,760
You're...

1316
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,920
Hey, Ed, I know you're losing your faith.

1317
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,580
I know you...

1318
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,060
...the men of...

1319
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,920
...you're of the this-is-hell doctrine.

1320
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,880
Ed Strange here seems to believe that...

1321
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
...that he lives in the city of this.

1322
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,540
...the reason there has been no X-Day rupture is that this is, in fact, hell.

1323
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:10,740
Hell.

1324
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,660
Well, dang.

1325
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,280
And we've never said it wasn't.

1326
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,200
We've been sept...

1327
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,200
We say it every third radio show.

1328
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,740
Every...

1329
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,100
It's an old joke around here.

1330
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:19,320
...staying.

1331
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,820
Every third Reich we say it.

1332
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,700
And every third Reich in world we rock it.

1333
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,200
And it's true.

1334
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,860
And it still keeps coming back in its same old saved monkey form.

1335
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:26,980
It's like that...

1336
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,940
But that don't mean Bob Dobbs ain't gonna save our butts.

1337
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,900
Because he said so.

1338
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,600
He still might.

1339
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,940
And if you can't believe Bob, who can't believe...

1340
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,540
There's no way in hell Bob Dobbs is going to save anything but his own stinky, slimy

1341
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:41,540


1342
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,440
What does it say in the pre-scripture is that Earth itself is not, in fact, hell.

1343
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
It doesn't.

1344
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,680
So it very well could be.

1345
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,800
It's just like that pink elephant right in front of your face that you refuse to see.

1346
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,280
Right, Proctor Strange.

1347
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:53,820
This is hell.

1348
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,840
You just refuse to see the flames.

1349
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,860
And once you do, you get kind of comfortable in it.

1350
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,140
And, Proctor Strange, can I ask you where as we walk...

1351
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,580
I'm sitting inside in the middle of the night and I got a hell of a sun tan.

1352
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,660
Where as we walk around in our sunlit malls and our acumen-bearing areas do we ever see

1353
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,520
the signs that say, this is not in hell.

1354
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,380
You're not in hell.

1355
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,220
Come on, man.

1356
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:11,920
You know it's true.

1357
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,180
We are in hell, Stan.

1358
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,240
See, now he...

1359
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,500
No.

1360
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,120
No.

1361
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,440
We are not in hell.

1362
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,100
Can you explain to me why every word of religion on the planet has doctored a decree that every

1363
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,360
single pleasurable act will lead you straight to hell and what is the world filled with

1364
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,380
decadence and pleasurable acts?

1365
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:29,760
Eggs.

1366
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,020
Obviously we are in hell.

1367
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:31,960
It's filled with eggs.

1368
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,240
Rich, moist, carbon-filled eggs.

1369
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,820
Let me play sort of an ironical...

1370
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,080
Ironically, they're right, but we're not going there.

1371
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,800
We are there.

1372
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,400
You know, it doesn't seem that hellish to me.

1373
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,240
It does to most of us, though.

1374
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,220
Actually, to me, Lord, I'm not going to hell.

1375
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1376
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1377
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1378
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1379
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1380
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,220


1381
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,460
It's like the drug war.

1382
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,800
What?

1383
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,540
Oh, great bringer of truth, Ray, you are lying to yourself.

1384
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,300
It's just like the drug war.

1385
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,200
I can't believe in the propaganda that it's supposed to be so bad.

1386
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,760
Just like drugs are bad.

1387
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,420
Hell is bad.

1388
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:57,960
Well, I will...

1389
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:07,240
I quit watching the news, so I haven't noticed any terrible disasters in, you know, no earthquakes

1390
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,080
or wars have affected me in the slightest.

1391
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,560
I did the same thing, doctor.

1392
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,540
No horrible murders or crimes.

1393
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:12,980
I have no idea.

1394
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,020
I pushed my DNA.

1395
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,860
I called the army.

1396
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,000
I called the army.

1397
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,980
I called the army.

1398
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,160
I called the army.

1399
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:17,880
I called the army.

1400
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:17,900
I called the army.

1401
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,200
I called the army.

1402
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,340
I called the army.

1403
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:18,500
I called the army.

1404
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,180
I called the army.

1405
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:19,380
I called the army.

1406
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:25,860
I spent half of this year wandering around doing things that everybody says are illegal

1407
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:25,860


1408
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,660
Bent over a log break like a donkey while being sodomized by a hillbilly.

1409
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,720
And everybody else around me was doing them too.

1410
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,300
Yeah, everybody does that.

1411
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,440
Only most of them passed out before I did.

1412
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,200
Well, you know, sometimes you have to pass out rather than...

1413
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,140
Because they're a bunch of amateur kids.

1414
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,940
Well, yeah, have you ever been sodomized by one of those really, really big donkeys?

1415
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,560
Have you ever met Bob Dobbs, my friend?

1416
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:44,820
Of course.

1417
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:49,000
Have you ever been initiated into bat as an apprentice over man, my friend?

1418
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,040
What do you think of this hole in the back of my body?

1419
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,380
Bob Dobbs could make a donkey scream out.

1420
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,820
Take it out.

1421
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,720
Take it out.

1422
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, it's stupid.

1423
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,320
You know I ain't all the way in you yet.

1424
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,500
Oriental.

1425
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,820
This is also Oriental.

1426
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,400
Some specious Brazilian tea.

1427
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,440
So slopey and sweet.

1428
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,440
So mixed up.

1429
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:25,080
A dog makes a donkey look like some kind of a little limp biscuit, baby.

1430
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,740
Now, what is this cut, Charles?

1431
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,740
Rock and roll, baby.

1432
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,680
But what is this particular cut, Charles?

1433
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,720
We're just playing the rock and roll.

1434
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,800
It's rock and roll heaven, baby.

1435
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,180
This ain't hell, it's rock and roll heaven.

1436
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,900
What is that cut on your neck?

1437
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,640
It's disco limbo, baby.

1438
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,260
You've heard that before.

1439
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,600
It seems you're too big of your dog for some type.

1440
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,620
Oh, baby.

1441
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,200
Oh, baby.

1442
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,500
I want to go tonight, but I can't.

1443
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,660
You see, I superglued my ass to the bottom of the Dodge.

1444
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,120
And the cupboard's full of toxic waste.

1445
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,740
I'm still crying.

1446
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,300
Now, don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

1447
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1448
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,500
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1449
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,720
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1450
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,460
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1451
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,440
Got your pencil ready?

1452
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,620
Bob, post office box...

1453
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,700
1-814-17.

1454
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:41,880
1-814-17.

1455
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,380
1-814-17.

1456
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1457
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1458
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1459
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1460
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1461
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1462
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1463
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1464
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1465
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,380


1466
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,340
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1467
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,120
4-4-1-1-8.

1468
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,000
That's Bob, P.O. Box.

1469
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,280
1-814-17.

1470
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,940
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1471
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,720
4-4-1-1-8.

1472
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,660
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1473
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,360
We had news in Black Rock.

1474
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,900
Big Beach, Ohio.

1475
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,600
Big Beach, Ohio.

1476
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,800
Boys are pink.

1477
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,480
Oh!

1478
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,520
Oh!

1479
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:36,820
Oh!

1480
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,380


1481
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:38,900


1482
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:40,440


1483
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:40,680


1484
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:40,800


1485
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1486
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1487
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1488
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1489
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1490
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1491
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1492
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1493
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,860


1494
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:40,960
Oh!

1495
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,100


1496
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,100


1497
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,100


1498
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh!

1499
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,340
Oh!

1500
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:45,340


1501
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:45,340


1502
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,120
Oh!

1503
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,600
Oh!

1504
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,360
Oh!

1505
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,520
Oh!

1506
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1507
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1508
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1509
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,580
Oh!

1510
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1511
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1512
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1513
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1514
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1515
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1516
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1517
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1518
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1519
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1520
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1521
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1522
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1523
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1524
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1525
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,580


1526
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,020
Boy, he's got a nasty Marais pattern.

1527
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,660
Who is this?

1528
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,060
Who is this?

1529
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,140
Somebody familiar, yeah?

1530
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,380
You know who that is?

1531
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,840
I mean, do you recognize him at all?

1532
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,520
No.

1533
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,360
That's Bob Dobbs.

1534
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,520
No, it's Bob Dobbs.

1535
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:04,760
I know.

1536
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,540
It's kind of like every white guy, a really dark-haired white guy.

1537
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,340
It's a church these guys started in Dallas one time ago.

1538
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,660
and see if anybody knew who he was.

1539
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,880
Nobody cares.

1540
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,180
No, nobody cares.

1541
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,300
You know who this is?

1542
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,160
No.

1543
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,620
Do you know who that is?

1544
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:22,760
No.

1545
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,440
They know.

1546
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,100
They just don't want to get involved with a bunch of religious nuts.

1547
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,280
Dobbs commotion, Dobbs commotion, Dobbs commotion, Dobbs commotion, Dobbs commotion.

1548
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,980
There's colors, man, colors.

1549
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,100
I'm looking at you, says Bob.

1550
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,700
Look, see, everybody's avoiding the street now because I'm holding this out.

1551
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,340
Go disco Bob.

1552
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,540
What is his name?

1553
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,280
What is his name?

1554
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:53,720
There's only two kinds of people in this world, those named Bob and those who wish they were

1555
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,320
named Bob.

1556
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,420
If you stare at it, it embeds its image on your skull, on the inside.

1557
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,400
Wait until you see what this thing does with a flashlight light at night.

1558
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,700
It's psychedelic as .

1559
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,040
Why don't we do that?

1560
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,220
I think we should do that.

1561
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,140
We can impress all kinds of girls with what you can do with a flashlight and a

1562
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,020
metal Dobbs head.

1563
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,060
Good morning.

1564
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm living an old Betsy here.

1565
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,000
I was just like a foul, distended pleasure beast.

1566
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,860
Jesus, that is gorgeous.

1567
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,780
And there's apparently like a big one, about four foot around one.

1568
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,520
Did you make this?

1569
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,980
Oh, yeah.

1570
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,260
Hey, look, look, look, look.

1571
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,400
There's some more of it, just like an old tampon of a sick old woman with tuberculosis.

1572
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,020
Dysentery.

1573
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,120
This is what you get for your $220.

1574
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,120
Boogers and cigarettes.

1575
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1576
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1577
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1578
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1579
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1580
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120


1581
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,240
There's some boogers that cause places that will never heal in your nose.

1582
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,260
Or the, well, it's only cost us $200.

1583
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,760
Philo said it would only cost us about $230.

1584
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,060
When you pull out the handle, when you have that booger you were talking about with the

1585
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,980
handles on it.

1586
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,240
Yeah.

1587
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,500
It's so big and so stiff.

1588
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,360
And so satisfying to remove.

1589
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,780
But when you pull it off, it pulls the skin off the wall of your face.

1590
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,640
So if you don't want me coming after you and showing everybody that tape of you taking

1591
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,360
a dump at Burning Man, the x-ray infrared tape that I have, you better send me a copy

1592
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,740
like I asked you of this tape.

1593
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,600
Or I'll have the rangers come to your house if you don't want that.

1594
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,820
You don't want a full body cavity search by a bunch of girl.

1595
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,680
Oh, yeah, you would.

1596
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:32,240
I mean, you would.

1597
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,120
But I'll send the boy rangers.

1598
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,240
So you better be careful, Smith.

1599
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,760
We're coming for you.

1600
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,100
Okay, where's the camera?

1601
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,100


1602
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,100


1603
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,100


1604
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,100


1605
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:40,420
Where's the off button?

1606
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:40,640
Just saying.

1607
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,660
I just want everybody to understand.

1608
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,160
Larry Says.

1609
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:42,860
You do it.

1610
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,580
Which is what you'd expect from a cult.

1611
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:46,680
Yep.

1612
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,460
They would put themselves...

1613
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:55,840
Those of us in the brown shirts, I mean the rangers, don't have to go to the indoctrination

1614
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,480
brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama

1615
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,500
brainwaaama brainwaaama brainwaaama.

1616
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,060
I fell in love with a girl back at that arena place.

1617
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,720
You did?

1618
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,140
Yeah.

1619
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,640
I said she was perfect.

1620
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,340
She was the...

1621
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:50,660
I could tell just by looking at her that she was the perfect personality and a nice girl

1622
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:50,960
too.

1623
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,600
Just I could tell just by the way she looked.

1624
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:04,580
So fresh and young and titted and butted and sort of bouncing and throbbing.

1625
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,880
I was just like, fuck you Bob!

1626
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,960
Fuck you Bob!

1627
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,820
Fuck you Bob!

1628
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:30,920
Fuck you Bob!

1629
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:37,440
Fuck you Bob!

1630
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:37,960
Fuck you Bob!

1631
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:45,460
Fuck you Bob!

1632
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,200
Fuck you Bob!

01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1634
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1635
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1636
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1637
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1638
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,200


1639
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,580
There is no more money!

1640
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,020
We gotta get some money!

1641
01:04:53,740 --> 01:05:05,200
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show and we're even more glad that some listeners

1642
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,420
have donated enough to help us keep on going.

1643
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:13,360
going for another couple of months. Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other

1644
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:21,240
archive sites. But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1645
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:28,200
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store

1646
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:35,440
pages and help out financially as best you can. Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink

1647
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,480
of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse. But some of

1648
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:48,380
you still have jobs. Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month

1649
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:55,640
from enough of you. Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference. All we're saying is that

1650
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:04,020
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs. We also take checks and money

1651
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,860
orders to...

1652
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:19,060
Subgenius Foundation. P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1653
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:24,280
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1654
01:06:48,260 --> 01:07:05,420
Subgenius Foundation. P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1655
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:05,860
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
