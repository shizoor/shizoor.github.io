00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,440
All characters are purely accidental.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,580
This is a recording.

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,560
This is a recording.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,600
This is a recording.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,520
This is a recording.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,560
This is a recording.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,560


8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,420
This is a recording.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,700
The Soul Genius.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,760
Power of Swatch.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,640
Bob was there to watch each dropping of each coprolite from each dinosaur sphincter.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,420
Bob saw.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,100
Bob sees now.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,940
Bob always will see.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,020
Bob.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,180


17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,840
Bob.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,360
Bob.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,080
Bob.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,100
Bob.

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,100
Bob.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,160


23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,200


24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,240
Please.

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Bob.

26
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,500
Bob.

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,900
Please.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Bob.

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,220
Bob.

30
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,500


31
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,500


32
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,500


33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Bob.

34
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,220


35
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,760
Bob.

36
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,480
Bob.

37
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,700
Bob.

38
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:01,800
Bob.

39
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:01,800


40
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:01,800


41
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,020
My name's Joe.

42
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,020
Joe Normal.

43
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm just an average kid from a regular all-American family.

44
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,300
My mother is preparing me an average early morning snack.

45
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,200
Toast, cereal, juice perhaps.

46
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,480
Looks normal, mother.

47
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,540
What is it?

48
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,880
I don't think I could find a more normal family anywhere in the whole universe.

49
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,200
You're a freak.

50
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,320
You're a freak.

51
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,300
Who said that!

52
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,540
You're a freak?

53
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,460
You're a freak?

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,960
You're a freak, you're a freak!

55
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm going down to Mexico to start me a UFO religion.

56
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:42,840


57
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Amy stands cm agent

58
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,080
you

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,240
you

60
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm normal.

61
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,540
Miss Letitia Van Allen and the Van Allen dancers.

62
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,400
You've got to taste all the fruit.

63
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,700
You've got to drink all the wine.

64
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,800
Hell, jail wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for all those faggots.

65
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,780
There's always some fruit after you.

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,060
That shouldn't bother you, Rusty.

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,780
Well, the whole idea makes me want to puke.

68
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,200
A man should act like a man.

69
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Know what I mean?

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,960
How should a man act?

71
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,680
He should ball chicks, that's how.

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,800
But only if he loves them.

73
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum.

74
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,040
Indianas.

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,020
What is norm?

76
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,480
Well, it's what everyone does.

77
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,720
I mean, it's what the majority of society does most.

78
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,160
Yeah.

79
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Come on.

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,160
Fill a bit.

81
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,900
Do something.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,620
Just for the...

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,280
Fill a bit.

84
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,860
Make every point.

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,920
While you taste every giant.

86
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
On the fruit.

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,140
You've got to taste all the fruit.

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,720
All the fruit.

89
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,140
Fruit.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,820
All the fruit.

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
You've got to taste all the fruit.

92
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,520
Okay, Joe.

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,060
You've got 60 seconds till lunchtime.

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,780
Let's keep everything normal, okay?

95
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Okay.

96
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,160
Five, four, three.

97
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm going to make it.

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,420
I'm going to make it.

99
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,280
I'm normal.

100
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm normal.

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,600
Do people think you're strange?

102
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,860
Yes.

103
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,280
Oh, yeah.

104
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,700
Are you abnormal?

105
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,480
Yep.

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,660
Are you different?

107
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,260
Do you urinate?

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,960
That's the important part.

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
If so, then you're different.

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,040


111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,040


112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,740
I'm sure you're going to be interested in what I have to say, my friend.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Are you ready to slide down the cutting edge?

114
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,540
Well, in that case, let's make some noise and praise Bob.

115
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Praise Bob.

116
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,160
Yeah.

117
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,920
Now, Bob is famous worldwide as the great traveling salesman of jokes, but more than

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,940
that, for his own pithy aphorisms.

119
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,880
The primary one of which is the only law, the one rule of our church, which is to keep

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,020
your mouth shut.

121
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,020


122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
And I think you know it, friends.

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,240
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

124
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,940
Bob also said the subgenius must have slack.

125
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,340
That doesn't mean you have to get slack.

126
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,300
That means you must already have slack to be a subgenius.

127
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,580
You're going to find out tonight how much slack you already had, especially once you

128
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,840
leave and the noise stops.

129
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,520
Bob also said you should choose the way you're going to get screwed.

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
Some ways are fine.

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,020
Yeah.

132
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,120
He said that, and this will come in handy on the job, my friends, if you act like a

133
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,860
dumb shit, they will treat you as an evil.

134
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,840
And you try that at work and you'll see what we mean.

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,740
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,140
We have two choices.

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,940
We can go with the one that represents our opinions.

138
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,160
The one that represents change or the one that represents the economy.

139
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,960
The scared, fraidy Bob is what I'm going to go with.

140
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm going to go with the one that represents hope and change.

141
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,720
But we'll keep the fraidy Bob lurking over my shoulder.

142
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Thanks.

143
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,120
You're thinking entirely too small.

144
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,040
You should have a minion to hold it up during the whole.

145
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,020
You know, I'm not going to do that.

146
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,020


147
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,960
The problem with this religion is a serious lack of minions.

148
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,280
And when we do get minions, they're such messed up people, we chase them away.

149
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,900
We deprogram our own cult zombies.

150
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,880
That's the truth.

151
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,500
Or we try.

152
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,680
There are some that you can't deprogram.

153
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,700
I've run into people who I've had to cross my fingers and go, oh, look, this is all just

154
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,220
made up.

155
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,400
Really.

156
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,020
You know.

157
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,840
You really should join some other religion.

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,940
Scientology something.

159
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,620
Because we couldn't deprogram them.

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,600
It was.

161
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,420
I want to follow you forever.

162
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,680
If you ever look at alt.slack on the internet, you'll see what I'm talking about.

163
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,960
Alt.

164
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,340
Alt.slack.

165
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,540
That's our forum.

166
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,200
It's not moderated or policed in any way because whoever had to do that would go completely

167
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,580
nuts.

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,000
But it's not.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000


170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,460
You know, I've never heard anything associated with you to be moderates.

171
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,120
What the hell do you think you're doing?

172
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,860
You're driving your butt through the damn cell and bonding your soul into a bunch of

173
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,180
pretty bad lacerations, Chloe.

174
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,000
What's the matter?

175
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,060
Wouldn't she kiss you?

176
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,380
Wasn't a kissing mood, doc.

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,200
Yeah, man ain't as good as he used to be.

178
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,140
Don't tell me about it.

179
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,220
I don't know, doc.

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,380
One man killed by an animal.

181
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,920
Another darn near.

182
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,340
It wasn't an animal that killed Joe.

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,140
The same goes for Chloe.

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,620
It was a man.

185
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,100
There were teeth in my mouth.

186
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


187
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


188
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


189
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


190
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


191
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


192
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


193
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


194
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


195
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


196
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,100


197
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,860
There were marks of an animal on Joe's throat.

198
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,080
She's right about the teeth marks.

199
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
What's the trouble, doc?

200
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
I think we both are.

201
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,800
What are you talking about?

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,220
Well, it had to be either animal or man.

203
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,740
What are the odds on that, doc?

204
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,860
Man, what you're trying to say is just a lot of poppycock, storybook stuff, the things

205
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,120
kids get nightmares about.

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,260
I know, I know.

207
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
But a witness saw what looked like a man killed Joe.

208
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,300
And Chloe, you're stone sober.

209
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,420
You got answers for it?

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,080
Yeah.

211
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,580
I haven't.

212
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,720
There is a word for what you're saying, Jack.

213
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,620
Yeah, I went to school, Amy.

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,760
But...

215
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,300
Mom?

216
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,100
But...

217
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,580
If you think I'm gonna put that in my medical report, if this gets in the papers, they're

218
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,900
gonna think we're all crazy up here.

219
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,900
I don't know whether I should take a sedative so I can sleep or drink coffee to stay awake.

220
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Drink the coffee and eschew the sedatives.

221
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,800
You don't want to be normal, do you?

222
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,080
That clip was from the 1956 movie, The Werewolf.

223
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,460
Before that, Preachings from the Winter Star revival of Ought 9 and from the Baltimore

224
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,660
08 one.

225
00:08:51,940 --> 00:09:00,300
And before that, some 1973 clips from the movie Myra Breckenridge and from the Liquid

226
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,180
TV short called, uh, I'm Normal by Stephen Polman.

227
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,580
Our titles were by Lemur and The Large.

228
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,500
And now back to...

229
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,720
Winter Star 09.

230
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,680
First off, friends, will you be my valentine?

231
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,300
Will you marry me?

232
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,780
Yes.

233
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,720
As a matter of fact, we will all get married.

234
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,640
If you remind me, before I show the video, I'll do a public mass marriage, and we can

235
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,160
all get married.

236
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,480
You know, the funny thing is, the first time I came to a winter star, 18 years ago!

237
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,480


238
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,480


239
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,180
Dennis and Linda Murphy walked up to me.

240
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,680
I'd never met them before, and they said, um, we're married now.

241
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,180
I was going, God, these people are really swingers.

242
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,260
But it turned out to be a spiritual marriage, but they were running around marrying everybody.

243
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,340
You remember that?

244
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,740
Wasn't our honeymoon great, Dennis?

245
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:13,460
Anyway, um, later on that same night, I walked into the drumming cabin, and Dennis and his

246
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,460


247
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,460


248
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,460


249
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,460


250
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,180
friends were dancing around, little candles on the floor, holding fake snakes.

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,620
And I was in such a religious mood from being at Winter Star that I thought they were real

252
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,040
snakes!

253
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,780
I thought I'd walked into a bunch of snake handlers.

254
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,720
It's like, wow, it's just like back home in Dallas!

255
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,480
I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and so did Dr. Philo Drummond, who first introduced me to

256
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,180
Bob, actually.

257
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,400
And, you know, when you grow up in a place like Dallas...

258
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,540
You have to pretend that you're like a Christian and even know what the different denominations

259
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,340
are and stuff.

260
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,340
I was actually raised a secular humanist weirdo.

261
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,920
My dad was a lawyer, what can I say?

262
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,960
But, uh, yeah, I...

263
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,600
Anyway, I'm glad, I'm happy that it's Valentine's Day.

264
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,360
Winter Star actually is a special, it's kind of like an anniversary for Princess Wee and I.

265
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,000
So, I'm married into this group.

266
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,860
I don't actually believe any of this bullshit.

267
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,420
And yet, here I am.

268
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,560
Yes, here I am, friends, lecturing to nice people that I consider superstitious.

269
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,720
Here then are my comments to the large crowd at Starwood 28.

270
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,440
Now, the story is...

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,560
Speaking of stupidity...

272
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,500
There's some great titles in the Starwood book.

273
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,540
I usually don't have to write much of a sermon for Starwood because there's so much great stuff just in the schedule.

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:09,600
Um, and this is not to put down the subject matter or the people who taught these courses or workshops or whatever.

275
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,820
It's just that they're funny titles.

276
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,440
Like...

277
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,660
This one.

278
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,560
The Drum Circle is not your backup band.

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,960
I've seen that.

280
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,400
It's got me to, um...

281
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,100
I was talking with, uh...

282
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,920
Was it you?

283
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know, somebody.

284
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,020
We were talking about the Starwood dumbassery.

285
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,160
The special dumbassery.

286
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,200
It started, go talk to the Brushwood staff.

287
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,720
Some of the things they have to tell people...

288
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,080
Oh, it started with, uh...

289
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,220
Somebody had left a nice delicate glass on the ground in the drum circle.

290
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,300
And somebody, some dumbass knocked a drum over, broke the glass.

291
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,680
So there's glass all over this place where there's barefoot people chomping around.

292
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,400
And, um...

293
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,920
So number one rule is don't leave glasses in the drum circle.

294
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,880
Breakable glasses.

295
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Also, the drums are not chairs for the public.

296
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,500
And you can't just use anybody's drum that you find sitting around.

297
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Now this is one that the...

298
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,440
Brushwood staff has to actually tell people.

299
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,460
It's in the, it's printed in their rules.

300
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,820
Don't set up your tent in the middle of the road.

301
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
And you laugh.

302
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,660
But I have seen people start to do that.

303
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,860
And that was before they even started drinking or doing the drugs.

304
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,240
And there's so much stupid shit that happens out here.

305
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,040
It gets to where some people become stupid shit snobs.

306
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,380
Where they don't...

307
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,900
They're only interested in a certain kind of stupid shit.

308
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,960
And there's a...

309
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,100
They look down on the others who are interested in the other kind of, the lesser stupid shit.

310
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,280
Anyway, the, um...

311
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,880
The drum circle is not your backup band.

312
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,860
Men's Sweat Lodge Workshop.

313
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,080
Now...

314
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,920
That just...

315
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,020
Have you ever stood downwind of a hippie?

316
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,460
How inviting does that sound?

317
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,360
I've actually been there.

318
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,000
I've actually...

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,120
I know what a sweat lodge is.

320
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I've actually been in one.

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,780
But...

322
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,600
Let's face it.

323
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,800
True origins of the ancient Hebrews.

324
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:30,060
Now, there's a whole division of redneck kookery that thinks that the true Israel are the people who came north to England.

325
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,020
And then moved to America.

326
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,000
And are now racist bastards.

327
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,800
And they're the true Jews.

328
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,800
That means they get...

329
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,720
They're better than anybody else in the chosen race.

330
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,140
And they get decided to lynch.

331
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,580
I don't think that that was what this one was actually about.

332
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,640
But it brings to mind those...

333
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm from Dallas.

334
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,060
You know, if you grew up in Dallas, Texas, wouldn't you start your own religion?

335
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,600
They're all telling you you're gonna go to hell.

336
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,460
So we just developed a bigger and better hell.

337
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,740
A much more interesting hell.

338
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,620
A hell that you can design yourself.

339
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,940
In fact, the subgenius...

340
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,040
You have to go through the subgenius hell first.

341
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,540
Just to be ready for the pleasures of subgenius heaven.

342
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,880
Because otherwise it would just kill you with pleasure.

343
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,160
I was hoping that my colleague Dr. Lecune would be here to elaborate on subgenius heaven and hell.

344
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,980
But he might have taken his chill pills.

345
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,280
And he may be in subgenius hell right now.

346
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,700
We'll see.

347
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,520
An audience with the gods.

348
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,160
Well, that's what I'm getting.

349
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,580
You are the gods.

350
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,160
That's what the New Age says anyway.

351
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,220
Everybody is a god.

352
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,600
That's ungodly.

353
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,420
Actually, you are all gods except for the ones who think you're gods.

354
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,220
You are assholes.

355
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,320
You are just all희.

356
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,760
We see the gods all the time.

357
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:14,760


358
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,060
Oh, there you are.

359
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,080
There you are.

360
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,500
The whole verecimento here.

361
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,500


362
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,900
Let's go see those去

363
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,380
Where did she go?

364
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,240
Mosey Lady Goal.

365
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,300
Is it at you?

366
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,180
Hey, I'm lying.

367
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,180


368
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,960
Damn straight up hot.

369
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,040
how to party. They know the secret of fire and the secret of rhythm, which the subgeniuses

370
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,880
certainly don't. We're working hard on both of those. So, you know, we're trying to learn

371
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,300
from you, but I know the other half are the fundy pagans. They're the ones who aren't

372
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:58,900
here. And they're the ones you'd like me to make fun of. Fundamentalists are the same

373
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,320
as they were, and they're fundamentalist subgeniuses. We call them bobbies. But we like to say we

374
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,600
put the fun in fundamentalism. We put the duh in fundamentalism. We put the me in fundamentalism.

375
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:21,280
We put the is in fundamentalism. The ism. The I. The mmm. It just goes. The mental.

376
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,480
We put a lot of the mental in fundamentalism. That must be old. I'm sure everybody here

377
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,620
has already come up with that.

378
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:40,880
Oh, the food guy. I just thought, now talk about gods. That's a great name for, that's

379
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,300
a great person to be, the food guy. After I, I feel differently now that I've named

380
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:57,360
him. Getting real, practicing honesty in relationships. That seems like that would just defeat the

381
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,660
purpose.

382
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:09,320
Toward a nude model for relationship. Oh no, new model. Pagan speed dating and networking.

383
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,780
I like that one. There's another one that's like redneck meth dating and networking.

384
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:26,660
Prosperity, a money washing ritual. And we're into that. Prosperity, money laundering, brainwashing.

385
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Same guy.

386
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,460
Same guy.

387
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,860
Same guy.

388
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:28,880
Same guy.

389
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:28,880


390
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:28,880


391
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:28,980
Same guy.

392
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:28,980


393
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:36,160
Food is magic. Food is magic. And the products of food are magic if you believe in Jenkum.

394
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Does anybody here know what, raise your hand if you know what Jenkum is. Okay, I'm not

395
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,540
going to go into that. Just forget it. You don't want to know. I could outgross you,

396
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,640
I could do something worse than anything Paul Krasner said. But I'm not going to lower

397
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,740
myself to scatological humility.

398
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,140
I'd make the reservation open about 94 hundred dollars.

399
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,140


400
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,140


401
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,640
People say that he is a good orator.

402
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:12,640


403
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,700
Why I need Reg�놱!

404
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,960
I got you Mm-mm- Aquariant sanitary gel.

405
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,580
ή

406
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,160
Happy I couldn't grew history.

407
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,180
For I can go to Genghis Khan to find out.

408
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,060
Don't you dare touch theل

409
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,480
I can do this forever and never to see me.

410
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,840
My father told me every day I have to go. IQue I can't tell you what to do now. I don't tell you.

411
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,800
Such a thing could have happened here, here in my own house.

412
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,620
Oh, what a pity.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,560
But I never dreamed such a thing could happen here to us.

414
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,520
Yes, I remember saying distinctly.

415
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,780
Oh, yes.

416
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, yes.

417
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,480
Oh, yes.

418
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, yes.

419
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,980
Oh, yes.

420
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,860
Here's another good title.

421
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,740
Quantum Holographic Fractal Universe.

422
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,040
The four least understood words in the dictionary.

423
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,380
But boy, are they handy.

424
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
Using those words.

425
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,640
There's like back in the old days, all you had to do to explain a giant monster was say, atomic radiation.

426
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:03,460
Well, now all you have to say is, to explain anything, including the JFK assassination,

427
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,320
Quantum Holographic Fractal Universe, man.

428
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
Homeopathy tips for...

429
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,220
Dis-ease free living.

430
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
No comment.

431
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,420
Teen pool party.

432
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,760
I missed it.

433
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,700
Oh, punctuation enhanced meaning.

434
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,920
I was going to mention that.

435
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,200
I was going through this book, and I noticed that some of the presenters obviously write their own blurbs.

436
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:40,720
And you can tell the ones who feel the most godly because they, their punctuation has the most...

437
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:40,720


438
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:40,720


439
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,620
capital letters.

440
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,060
And they capitalize every noun to give it this profundity, this weight.

441
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,680
And especially if it's a noun describing the things that they're expert in.

442
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,940
Things that are normally not punctualized, capitalized at all.

443
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,720
Now, I'm guilty of comic book punctuation, where certain words have all caps all the way through.

444
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,500
That's a type of kook punctuation.

445
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,700
Unless you're a comic book reader.

446
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,760
You're a subgenius.

447
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,180
Then it's comic book punctuation.

448
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,360
And that's cool.

449
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,600
I think that's about it with the...

450
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,320
Oh, The Dark Side of the Moon.

451
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,320
Damn, I missed that.

452
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,240
What a great title.

453
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,320
I bet it was, too.

454
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,600
Ascend was this morning.

455
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,620
Ascend as opposed to front end.

456
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,960
I suppose.

457
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,680
Oh, and our friend Phil Farber had a thing called introduction to math.

458
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:40,680


459
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:40,680


460
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,120
It was about meta magic.

461
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,700
And I read up on that, and it was basically the magic of magic.

462
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,500
And I thought, I should do one that's like meta skepticism.

463
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,940
The debunking of skepticism.

464
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,120
Which is not that hard to do.

465
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
The art of possession.

466
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,620
Deity, demon, or departed?

467
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,300
Not enough choices.

468
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,320
I think there's a few.

469
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,500
Steve Gaskin was talking about zen of politics and the transmission of mind.

470
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,100
And I think zen is the best way to look at politics.

471
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,780
Because otherwise you'll just go crazy.

472
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:34,900
I've been studying radical and reactionary politics and extremes for so long that I've been driven directly into the middle of the road.

473
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,280
Which some people say, this is the most dangerous place to be.

474
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,580
But you know what?

475
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,600
Politics isn't really a road.

476
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,240
And there is a meeting in any way.

477
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,520
And generally we tend to try to stay about 15 feet above the road.

478
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,100
So you can look down on it and get an overview of the whole thing.

479
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,080
And at that point you notice that it's a good cop, bad cop game.

480
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,360
But they're all cops!

481
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,520
Just a gag of all the idiotic, dangerous pranks.

482
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm not a cop.

483
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,140
I'm a man.

484
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


485
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


486
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


487
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


488
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


489
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


490
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


491
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


492
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


493
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


494
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


495
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


496
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


497
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,140


498
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140


499
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Give me the police.

500
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,440
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

501
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,360
What do you need the police for?

502
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,480
Please try to understand.

503
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,200
In some individuals, as little as one millionth of an ounce of these experimental chemotherapy compounds can induce a full-blown psychosis.

504
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,120
Hello.

505
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,040
This is Dr. Bernard Anderson.

506
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,760
I want to report that a Mr.

507
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,800
Todd Stiles.

508
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,600
You stupid.

509
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,560
Todd, please.

510
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,760
Just a minute.

511
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,280
Stupid, stupid.

512
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,180
Mr. Todd Stiles is in an induced psychotic state.

513
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,580
He's at large somewhere in the city and is potentially dangerous to others and to himself.

514
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,960
You know, I'm going to do something that we all have to do eight times a day out here at Brushwood, which is change clothes.

515
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,840
It's really hot.

516
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,560
I'm going to take off this televangelist outfit, as shiny as it is.

517
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,780
You know, it's like in the morning.

518
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,500
You get up and have to put on two pairs of pants and a coat.

519
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,220
And then in about an hour, you have to strip down to a T-shirt and shorts.

520
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,620
And then finally, just a T-shirt.

521
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,760
And then later on, it gets cold.

522
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,460
So suddenly, you're back in the coat and the pants again.

523
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,640
And then you do too much.

524
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,880
You take one chill pill too many.

525
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,600
And then you say, you know, you're naked again.

526
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,720
Even though it's freezing cold.

527
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,120
So.

528
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,740
There's no more coffee.

529
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,100
There's no more to Italy.

530
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,700
There's no more anything anymore.

531
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,360
It's over.

532
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,300
What the?

533
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,140
There goes the bottle.

534
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,040
Kind of a funny taste.

535
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,560
Oh, sorry.

536
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,780
I just had to put that in so you could.

537
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,800
Oh, pardon you.

538
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,980
Oh, well, somebody cleaned that up.

539
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:54,980
What?

540
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,180
Hal, what are you doing here?

541
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,740
I just put that poison in there.

542
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,680
Well, I'm here with a plan to stick it to the.

543
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,040
Man.

544
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,420
Hey, man, wherever you are, you better watch out.

545
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,560
But I'm dynamite.

546
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,120
Check out my move.

547
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,600
What can we expect from him?

548
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,300
Anything, everything, a whole range of human emotions.

549
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,180
Well, there must be some kind of pattern, some basic pattern.

550
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,680
Yes, there is a basic pattern.

551
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:33,700
I'm sure you can see it.

552
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,980
Even in microscopic doses, these compounds can induce hallucinations, psychotic state,

553
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,780
both temporary but roughly comparable to those of schizophrenia.

554
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,640
Uh-huh.

555
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,360
I see.

556
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,660
Well, I don't.

557
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,700
I mean, what's going on here?

558
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,620
These two idiots here give my buddy a glass of drugs and make some guard of his mind,

559
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,760
and you stand here, and you talk, and you talk, and you talk.

560
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,040
Well, what do you suggest we do, Murdoch?

561
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,700
Stop talking and get out and look.

562
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,100
How?

563
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,500
I don't know.

564
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Just get out and look.

565
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,620
Where?

566
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,180
Where?

567
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,980
That's for you to know.

568
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,360
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.

569
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,540
Where?

570
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,120
And how?

571
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,460
I'm sorry.

572
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,080
Go ahead, will you?

573
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,520
All right, doctor, go ahead.

574
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,540
Phase one has already taken place.

575
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,360
Yawning, intense drowsiness, sleep, a minute, an hour, depending.

576
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,880
Then, uh...

577
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,000
Explosions, Bill.

578
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,460
As in this case, but not as a rule.

579
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,520
Possibly you had just angered him, a grievance, an imagined grievance of some kind.

580
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,460
It's possible.

581
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,820
It's very possible.

582
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,460
What did I do?

583
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,120
Look, you and you and you, shut up, all three.

584
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,900
Just shut up.

585
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,220
Murdoch.

586
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,160
Stiles should now be in the swiftly transitory phase two.

587
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,700
Patience describe this as a state of confusion, a feeling of helplessness,

588
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,740
a sleepwalking, a nightmare, lost in a great, mysterious cobweb world.

589
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,500
But, doctor, you said transitory.

590
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,260
Yes.

591
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,680
Well, transitory to what?

592
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,620
Trouble.

593
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,380
Following this state, the really dangerous phases begin.

594
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,100
FIRST, The patient becomes euphoric, high, a giant ten feet tall.

595
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,760
FIRST, The patient becomes euphoric, high, a giant ten feet tall.

596
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,800
Unpredictable. Uncontrollably happy.

597
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,440
At one with the world.

598
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,120
How long does that high stage last?

599
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,440
Good question.

600
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,620
Total effect of the compound will last from six to eight hours,

601
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,840
depending on the individual and upon the amount administered.

602
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,540
Six to eight hours?

603
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,280
You've got to find them before then.

604
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,160
Well, we hope to.

605
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
In any event, I'd better be with you to administer the antidote.

606
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,680
This will cut short the effect and greatly ease any after effects.

607
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,500
Well, it's a big town, Doctor.

608
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
What happens if we don't find them?

609
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,740
After the high period, what then?

610
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,660
What goes up must come down.

611
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,200
Depression?

612
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,660
First paranoia.

613
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Intense.

614
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,600
Terrible.

615
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,160
Unreasoning terror.

616
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
Then depression.

617
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,100
In my own experience, I found that...

618
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,540
You say in your own experience?

619
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,720
All of us working in the field have undergone at least 20

620
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,220
and as many as...

621
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,700
40 sessions with the compound.

622
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,640
And in the final phase of depression,

623
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,120
all of us, even the most stable,

624
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,960
have turned potentially suicidal.

625
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,060
40 sessions, friends.

626
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,920
I've done a...

627
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,300
Actually, I've done 150 sessions.

628
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,020
Thanks to Lemur and Mr. Sistar for the cuts

629
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,140
from Route 66 to Mr. Sistar

630
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,500
and to Ace.

631
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,980
In Cleveland.

632
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,900
Which puts on Starwood every year.

633
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,640
They also put on Winterstar in the winter.

634
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,720
And coming up,

635
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,020
some pagan put-on

636
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,520
from what they put on at Starwood.

637
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,960
And we also heard some puzzling evidence show

638
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,680
from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell.

639
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,120
Now, back to Starwood 09

640
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,520
and my reviews of my fellow presentars.

641
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,620
Oh, Paul Krasner's thing, Porn Soup.

642
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,900
When I read that title, I thought,

643
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,380
now that's false advertising.

644
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
I just know it is.

645
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,320
But it wasn't.

646
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,920
It was for...

647
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,280
He was telling the truth.

648
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,780
I've seen those websites, every single one of them.

649
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,240
He's talking about the scandals.

650
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,200
Terrible.

651
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,960
It's awful, the things that we're doing.

652
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,460
Oh, Ferry Races of the British Isles.

653
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,700
That was just done a little while ago in the lounge.

654
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,640
And I had been wondering about the ferry races.

655
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,220
I heard the...

656
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
They were doping the ferries,

657
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,720
and there was a big scandal about that.

658
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,160
They were going to call off ferry racing

659
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,980
because of all the illegal doping.

660
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,400
And...

661
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, and also, experimental...

662
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
My friend Beth Rosemary was doing

663
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,820
experimental ferry working.

664
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,960
I thought that the slave trade in ferries

665
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,880
had been maybe illegal.

666
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,920
Ferry working.

667
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,740
How can...

668
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,960
What are they good for?

669
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,120
Tying your shoelaces?

670
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,460
Standing in nowhere.

671
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,000
Well, here I am.

672
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,860
Oh, and here's the...

673
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm going to finish with this one.

674
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,900
Kenny Kline's...

675
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,580
This is the most honest title of all of these.

676
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,740
Opinionated history of pagan music.

677
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,700
He didn't say a history of pagan music.

678
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,560
He said opinionated history of pagan music.

679
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,980
And that is...

680
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,500
Honest.

681
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,560
And that's good.

682
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,560
What time is it?

683
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,400
Oh, my God.

684
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,760
Friends, you don't have to sit

685
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,420
and watch this defilement.

686
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,100
Nor do you have to sit and watch

687
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,280
the stupid TV shows you complain about.

688
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,680
Somebody was complaining about

689
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,000
our stupid blather on alt.slack.

690
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,820
And British subgenius,

691
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,700
Reverend Diva Schematic...

692
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,660
Oh, she was replying to somebody who said,

693
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,020
anybody who's really into Star Wars...

694
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,600
is a mental defective who needs to be put down.

695
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,960
It's like, doesn't that describe pretty much everybody?

696
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,600
And she said,

697
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,460
you aren't forced to watch these things, idiot.

698
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,760
If you don't like being fucked up the ass with a brick,

699
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,240
stop sitting on the brick!

700
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,160
So that was the word solidified.

701
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,700
My friend Sodi said,

702
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,540
in the gap between the best possible result

703
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,220
and the best result...

704
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,600
possible lurks slack.

705
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,040
And as Nenslo said,

706
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,520
the Church of the Subgenius

707
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,840
is like steroids on acid.

708
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,180
And then there's Sock-a-to-me.

709
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,720
Yeah, Sock-a-to-me.

710
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,160
Boc-a-lock-a-lock-a-boob-boob.

711
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,280
Bocula? Oh, no, that's a bone inside the raccoon's...

712
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,720
Well, you know, I mean...

713
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,220
Error.

714
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
And not just a raccoon, but other...

715
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,460
animals.

716
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,400
Nothing known to contain such a...

717
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,960
device.

718
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,960
Hello.

719
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,380
Honk.

720
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,840
So this is the way you go to school.

721
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,240
This is the way you wear your pants.

722
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,260
This is the way you wash your face.

723
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,040
This is the way you comb your hair.

724
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,880
This is the way you tie your shoes.

725
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,720
And this is the way you make your pants.

726
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,220
This is the way you button your butt.

727
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,200
This is the way you do everything.

728
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,880
This is the way you brush your teeth.

729
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,960
And that's part of everything.

730
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,900
Not upside down.

731
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,840
No.

732
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,140
So, um...

733
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,280
Look at the size of that creature.

734
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,120
Easy enough. Easy for you to say.

735
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,940
The Brontosaurus.

736
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,100
A moving mountain of flesh and bone.

737
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,420
So last week, uh...

738
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,880
Yeah?

739
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,200
The episode was called,

740
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,200


741
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,200


742
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,520
The episode before last.

743
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,140
Now which episode was that? Let me look in my planner.

744
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,640
That was the one you left that...

745
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,980
You started to say that one thing...

746
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,380
What?

747
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,860
At that one juncture. That one...

748
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,240
crucial...

749
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,300
juxtaposition.

750
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,260
Between concept A and...

751
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,120
I suppose...

752
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,860
Extension of concept Q-R-Y...

753
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,740
We have to get into that now?

754
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,560
Exponent Y.

755
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,500
I don't know if it does us any good to recapitulate these old problems...

756
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,460
when we have so much...

757
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,960
before us.

758
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,900
In the future. In the immediate future.

759
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,060
Can you help us call it a go?

760
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:32,900
Yes.

761
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm here, my boy.

762
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,680
This is Reverend Neuromancin calling.

763
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,520
Well, and the top of the morning to you.

764
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:41,980
Neuromancin, huh?

765
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes, Neuromancin. Hi, hello you.

766
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,700
Yes, don't take too much Neuromancin.

767
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,900
And what can we do for thee?

768
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,860
Well, I was just curious.

769
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,500
You know, knowing that, uh...

770
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,480
fanboyism is almost a canon word...

771
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
to religiousness...

772
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,720
Uh... idolatry.

773
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,540
What do you think of the new Star Trek movie...

774
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:01,920
coming out?

775
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,600
Well, obviously, most people wouldn't be able...

776
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,540
to give such an answer, since as you point out...

777
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,480
the movie is coming out, and has not...

778
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,420
come out. Therefore, no one can be expected...

779
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,320
to have seen it. But I, with my...

780
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,500
occult powers, have viewed...

781
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,940
this movie in its entirety.

782
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,080
And I can tell you that it's the...

783
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,500
best reconstituted Star Wars...

784
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,520
I mean, Star Trek movie...

785
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,360
that one could possibly have, according...

786
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,620
to, uh, current trends and such...

787
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,140
Well, such things are inevitable.

788
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,300
Yeah, but, uh...

789
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,460
also, remember, now the fans...

790
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,520
the nerds, all these people...

791
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,060
they are now in control.

792
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,800
They are now a majority, not an isolated subculture.

793
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,300
They will make the movie...

794
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,720
the way they want it to.

795
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,200
Yes, you will die before you see the movie...

796
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,120
version of Star Trek.

797
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,320
I want to spend $500 million on a movie, and I want...

798
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,880
to spend it all on a cardboard set.

799
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,540
Tish Tush, my boy, that is...

800
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,840
chicken feed these days.

801
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,560
$500 million? How about $10 billion?

802
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,980
The entire thing made in front of a green screen.

803
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,720
How about... how about...

804
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,520
infinity billion?

805
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,180
How about vintage?

806
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,300
Then they get on YouTube and instantly it makes money.

807
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,700
Yeah.

808
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,940
Right, that's a great way to make money.

809
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,820
Put everything on YouTube and, man,

810
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
the cash starts rolling in.

811
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,900
And when the weekend's over and September rolls down...

812
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,320
Yes, YouTube is the path to stardom, friends, for somebody.

813
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,400
In the meantime,

814
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,480


815
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,480


816
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,420
we at the Subgenius Foundation

817
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,880
have made a bunch of new movies,

818
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,700
or rather,

819
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,180
in some cases, posted

820
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,340
a lot of old movies.

821
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,200
They're animated,

822
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,860
and they offer mind control

823
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,360
over you by us,

824
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,160
if you dare.

825
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
YouTube account RevStang

826
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,880
will take you there,

827
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,020
as will any click

828
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,960
on subgenius.com.

829
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,920
Yes, we did a bunch of

830
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,060
animation and music.

831
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,360
But that is not

832
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,120
the most important

833
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,460
thing in life.

834
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,460
The most important

835
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,620
thing in life is dinner.

836
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,000
And that's about to happen.

837
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,760
But first we will show

838
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,420
one of these

839
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,220
brainwashing videos.

840
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,760
These things, by the way,

841
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,620
are meant to replace recreational drugs.

842
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,620
I occasionally find

843
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,680
people using them

844
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,220
with recreational drugs.

845
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,080
And that's like...

846
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,420
Well, too much is always better than not enough.

847
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,280
As Bob said.

848
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
But it's almost as bad.

849
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,420
So I guess we will show

850
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,680
part four.

851
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,260
Did you bring any recreation for me?

852
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,640
But this

853
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,980
cerebral reformatter...

854
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,420
Rev. Stang, what is that

855
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,500
one law you were saying there's one law...

856
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,320
Oh, there's one law in the Church of the Subgenius.

857
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention it.

858
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,480
The one law in the Church of the

859
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,620
Subgenius is...

860
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,900
Fuck everybody, can't take a show!

861
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,840
We'll just show this one.

862
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,120
It's 13 minutes long and then you can go eat.

863
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,720
And it will make you feel

864
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,100
like you're on acid.

865
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,720
I hope.

866
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,720
If you like acid.

867
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,400
Now for a moment, let's consider

868
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,200
an entirely different type of case.

869
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,540
The case of Bob,

870
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,280
one which shows how ambitious men

871
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,340
can get ahead under our American

872
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,660
system of free enterprise.

873
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,480
When Bob graduated from high school,

874
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,440
Bob was surprised to learn

875
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,600
that this Bob Society had created

876
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,680
a special type of life for people

877
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,400
of his type. Right, Bob?

878
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,820
Well, life never was a burden.

879
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,740
In the first place,

880
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,920
Bob's flexible.

881
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,800
Bob can expand or contract.

882
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,540
Now, Bob

883
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,220
has gone far.

884
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,340
Why not profit by Bob's example?

885
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,640
Send the postcard care of this station

886
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,960
to the Bob Society.

887
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,940
Bob.

888
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,400
Bob.

889
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,460
I.

890
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,660
Bob.

891
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,600
Bob.

892
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,460
Bob.

893
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,300
Bob.

894
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,640
Bob.

895
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:08,660
Bob.

896
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,400
Bob.

897
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,320
Bob.

898
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:10,960
Bob.

899
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,160


900
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,160


901
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,640
Bob.

902
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,980
Bob.

903
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,580
Bob.

904
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,120
thing about Bob.

905
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,460
Hey

906
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,700
Bob.

907
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,380
He loves you, Bob.

908
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,760
You love Bob.

909
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,120
You have to.

910
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,000
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

911
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,080
He'll kill you.

912
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,840
So Bob, you out.

913
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,600
Him, Bob, you out.

914
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
She's 24-3 now.

915
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,560
You heard it here first.

916
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,060
You don't love Bob.

917
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,700
You have to.

918
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,780
You have to.

919
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,220
You have to.

920
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,160
1-3-0-1-3

921
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,180
1-3-0-1-3

922
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,040
Bob?

923
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,100
Bob?

924
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,420


925
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,780
Bob.

926
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:21,980
Like.

927
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,820
Raw meat.

928
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,600
Yeah.

929
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,360
Bob, calm now.

930
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,480
You better investigate.

931
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,620
You may get into trouble.

932
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,940
Bob, smell food.

933
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,660
In that van.

934
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,220
Yeah.

935
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,220
There's something familiar about him.

936
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,580
Bob.

937
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,080
Bob.

938
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,620
Bob.

939
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:45,860
Bob.

940
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,860
Bob.

941
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:46,860


942
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:46,860


943
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:46,860


944
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,720
Bob.

945
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,020
Bob.

946
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,020


947
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,060
Bob.

948
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,120
Bob.

949
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,140


950
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,140


951
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,140


952
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,140


953
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,280
Bob solvent.

954
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,040
Bob won't solve your problems.

955
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,220
But he will help you to blow them off!

956
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,680
You can't use Bob as a crutch because

957
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,160
he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.

958
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,180
Mr. Pornriver speaking.

959
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,180


960
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,180


961
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,180


962
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,180


963
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,440
Well, gee, it's Bob

964
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,140
Yeah, Bob

965
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,340
Yeah, but Bob's going to be there

966
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,420
Even if Bob, Bob, Bob

967
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,920
Yeah, well, no

968
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,440
Yes, if Bob

969
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,900
Bob

970
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,760
Bob

971
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,100
Bob

972
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,380
Bob

973
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,920
Bob

974
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,520
Bob

975
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,640
Bob

976
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,020
Bob

977
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,180
Bob

978
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,900
Bob

979
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,040
Bob

980
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,880
Bob

981
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,000
Bob

982
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,300
You make me sick

983
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,280
Tell Bob

984
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,660
Bob

985
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:30,660


986
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,460
Bob

987
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,240
Bob

988
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,600
Bob

989
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,000
Bob

990
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,200
Bob

991
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
Bob

992
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,240
Bob

993
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,800
Thank you.

994
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,660
Thank you.

995
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,720
Good morning. This weekend we commemorate Bob Day.

996
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,680
Bob is a proven leader who has served six presidents, four Republicans, and two Democrats.

997
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
And he has shown that he is an agent of change.

998
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,980
And I am deeply grateful for his service.

999
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,520
Clear. Clear. And I pledge to the party.

1000
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,840
He doesn't care about your sins.

1001
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,460
He comes not to forgive, but to rationalize your sins.

1002
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,080
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.

1003
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,200
And what did you really need?

1004
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,360
If you want your sins forgiven, friends, do it yourself.

1005
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,680
If you're a subgenius, you're probably already pretty good at that.

1006
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,980
Jesus may have died for your sins,

1007
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,620
but Bob Dobbs made a damn fool of you.

1008
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,000
Of himself.

1009
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,240
And of you.

1010
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,880
For your sins.

1011
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,280
Hello, Bob, and I'm so happy to give my personal testimony.

1012
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,740
Fifty years ago, I was a freshman in high school,

1013
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,360
and that happened May 10, 1941.

1014
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,640
I accepted Bob as my personal savior, and he's never let me down since.

1015
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,460
I'm a retired teacher, a widow, I've had cancer and all kinds of stuff,

1016
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,040
but he's always by my side.

1017
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,560
Thank you so much.

1018
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:13,940
Bob.

1019
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,060
Bob.

1020
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,280
Bob.

1021
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,920
Bob.

1022
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,300
Bob.

1023
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,520
Did Bob and sex go hand in hand?

1024
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,920
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

1025
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:29,740
Slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad money after Bob!

1026
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,620
And you can do that at our lovely sales table down there.

1027
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,520
Bob?

1028
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:51,880
That is a cut from the video soundtrack of Subgenius Igasm Part 4.

1029
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,520
By yours truly, Lemur and Norell,

1030
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,320
of which you can see a lot more if you check out the Rev Stang pages on YouTube

1031
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,220
or Subgenius Igasm on Google.

1032
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,300
But these are soundtracks of videos.

1033
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,860
Normally we have attractive preachers and we don't need the video as a distraction,

1034
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:33,040
but we'd love to program your mind with the image of Bob.

1035
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,980
Incidentally, you see the parts where the picture gets really fuzzy and grainy?

1036
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,640
That's where the actual brainwashing code is.

1037
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,920
It's not what you think.

1038
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,840
It's not what you are consciously seeing,

1039
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,780
but it's the fuzzy stuff and the weird little sound effects and things.

1040
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,420
That's where the actual brainwashing is.

1041
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:54,980
Morgan.

1042
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,600
Newspaper says they found an animal's teeth marks in the dead man's throat.

1043
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,360
Morgan, what have you done?

1044
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,480
Done?

1045
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,240
Accomplish is a better word, Emery.

1046
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,440
Someday it will happen.

1047
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,940
The human race will destroy itself.

1048
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,920
Not quickly, but slowly.

1049
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,540
That wolfman is the proof.

1050
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,480
Radiation creates mutants, people who become monsters no longer human.

1051
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,560
They'll make the hydrogen bomb more powerful, then more powerful again.

1052
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,240
Enough to change every person that faced the earth into a crawling inhuman thing through fallout radiation.

1053
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,540
Would you really believe it'll happen in our lifetime?

1054
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,560
The science of destruction always gains on us, Emery.

1055
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,540
It could happen tomorrow, next day, next week.

1056
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,180
I don't know.

1057
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,540
But it won't happen to us.

1058
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,840
Well, how can you be sure?

1059
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,740
By a slow series.

1060
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,500
By a series of inoculations.

1061
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,620
We can immunize ourselves.

1062
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,740
And a small select group, just as I'd planned.

1063
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,120
When the rest of the world has been destroyed, we will be the only normal thinking persons left.

1064
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,640
The perfect science, Emery.

1065
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,700
The one that ends all science.

1066
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,520
Perhaps it would have been better not to know what's coming.

1067
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,100
Ridiculous.

1068
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,600
It'll mean the beginning of a new kind of world.

1069
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,900
A world that'll start without...

1070
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,660
hatred.

1071
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,920
And we'll be the ones to give it up.

1072
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,140
To the birth.

1073
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,720
Who wants to...

1074
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,320
Oberon did this one, I guess, yesterday.

1075
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,080
Who wants to live forever?

1076
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,820
And friends, I don't.

1077
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,620
When you're young, not only do you want to live forever, but you think you're going to.

1078
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,080
And it's even developed to the point where there's a theory called the singularity, right?

1079
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,740
Kurzweil was the guy who came up with this.

1080
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:49,040
The idea that the computers are getting so much faster, and we're learning so much, and there's this curve, right, of knowledge.

1081
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,580
And we're now approaching this part of the curve of knowledge, where we're learning so much so fast,

1082
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,160
that at some point, the computers will get much smarter than us, and they'll rebuild new computers that are even smarter,

1083
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,400
and they'll have the answers to everything, and everything will be perfect in about 50 years.

1084
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,340
And that's called the singularity.

1085
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,560
So if you can live that long, you might well be able to live forever.

1086
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,440
And I think that's a beautiful religious belief.

1087
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:21,620
But what it leaves out is the ideogularity, the opposing force.

1088
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,600
As some of you may have seen that movie Idiocracy, which shows the opposing force.

1089
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,900
Yes, praise Mike Judge.

1090
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,740
He used to listen to our slack when he lived in Dallas, by the way.

1091
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,680
And, you know, that's the thing.

1092
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,260
It's a race.

1093
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,840
It's a race.

1094
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,400
Which will we get to first, the ideogularity or the singularity?

1095
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:52,560
And I personally, I think that all of, ever since 1998, I haven't been much for predictions.

1096
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,560
I must say.

1097
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:02,460
And Frank Zappa said, you know, we all grow up, oh, yeah, Sylvia was saying,

1098
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,980
every generation has its own dystopia.

1099
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,820
When I was growing up, at first, the dystopia.

1100
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,040
Dystopia was like Planet of the Apes or Road Warrior.

1101
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,720
It was going to be a nuclear holocaust and all civilization was going to get destroyed

1102
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,880
except for the baddest asses and the gorillas or something.

1103
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,160
Unfortunately, I wish.

1104
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,860
But then there was the 1984 dystopia, which some people grew up with.

1105
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,000
And now the kids have grown up with the global warming dystopia and so forth.

1106
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,540
You know, it's different for each person.

1107
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,940
And I'm 55 now.

1108
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:52,880
And I'm glad that I probably won't live to, you know, to be 150.

1109
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:02,540
Because I see things getting dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber.

1110
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,140
And I used to, my dad used to say, I'd be listening to Jimi Hendrix and go,

1111
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,520
that stuff.

1112
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,640
Not even music.

1113
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,560
It's just noise.

1114
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,840
Now I'm starting to hear my own friends that are my age go, that's rap music.

1115
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,820
That's not even music.

1116
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,720
That's just noise.

1117
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,040
Well, they were both right.

1118
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,480
But the thing is, you know, you turn on the TV.

1119
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,980
The less you watch TV, the dumber it looks when you do watch it.

1120
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,400
And it's every time I try to live in my own little ivory tower and talk to nothing but subgeniuses.

1121
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,580
And that's depressing enough.

1122
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:47,120
But, you know, I was telling my friend Nikki, it's like, she's 20 years younger than me.

1123
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:53,120
And she'll have to see 20 years more worth of dumb assery than I'll have to.

1124
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,420
Now, I might not live to see the free energy thing or, you know, Mr. Fusion.

1125
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,540
I might miss out on some good stuff.

1126
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:07,980
But at the same time, I think it's best that we old folks make room for the young ones.

1127
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,480
Because I don't think.

1128
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,500
I think we're tough enough for some of the crap they're going to have to deal with.

1129
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,700
We're in the middle of a species, a mass extinction.

1130
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,580
There's been a lot of them.

1131
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,560
You know, most people know about the one that wiped out the dinosaurs.

1132
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,140
But there was actually a couple before that that were much, much worse.

1133
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,420
And there have been some since then.

1134
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,040
And we're the latest one.

1135
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,540
It's been going on for about 50,000 years.

1136
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,500
And it's really coming to a head.

1137
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:38,880
And.

1138
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,120
I don't have any advice at all.

1139
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,380
I can't tell you what your slack is.

1140
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,240
I can't tell you how best you can fight the conspiracy.

1141
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,460
As St. Kim Kesey put it, put your good where it'll do the most.

1142
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,640
I don't know what your good is.

1143
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,520
Maybe your good is voting for Rush Limbaugh for president.

1144
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,400
Hell if I know.

1145
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,200
But it's, you know, it is up to you.

1146
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,160
It's up to you and your slack.

1147
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,900
And I'm glad I'm not going to live forever.

1148
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,620
And then it's all it's all of subgenius 101.

1149
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,660
But I don't think I need to explain any of that to you.

1150
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,480
I think you already know everything you need to know.

1151
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,240
As my father said to my son, I know everything worth knowing.

1152
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,300
And your dad knows everything else.

1153
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,580
Oh, by the way, I have to announce, I honestly really thought about this.

1154
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,080
I'm a grandfather now.

1155
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,520
I'm so old.

1156
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,700
I've become a grandpa.

1157
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,380
My daughter.

1158
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,420
Had got married and then had a child.

1159
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,860
It's convenient when it happens in that order.

1160
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:53,780
And I was going to just show slides of my beautiful new grandson for the whole hour.

1161
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,300
But I think Judith talked me out of it at the last minute.

1162
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:58,640
Yeah.

1163
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:58,980
Yeah.

1164
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,040
By the way, friends, hit those vendor tables.

1165
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,980
It's Valentine's Day.

1166
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,440
There's somebody you need a gift for.

1167
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,580
It may be you.

1168
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,680
And the money's not worth anything.

1169
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,560
So don't worry about it.

1170
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,580
As Onan said in that rant, you already have all the money you're going to need for when you're dead anyway.

1171
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,980
That's one way to think about it.

1172
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,980
Of course, Onan's only 40.

1173
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,480
He's a young fellow by my standards.

1174
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,260
Man, my age needs his sleep.

1175
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,420
Oh, and could I ask a question, Dr. Howell?

1176
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,580
Well, we probably have time to squeeze in one question.

1177
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,440
You just did ask a question.

1178
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,060
Please go ahead and ask a question.

1179
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,280
Oh, excellent question.

1180
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,460
Thank you.

1181
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,460


1182
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,460


1183
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,460


1184
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,860
Second question.

1185
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,240
This is your second question.

1186
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,420
Yeah.

1187
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,200
Regarding Dr. Wortham's comics and stories, do they still exist now?

1188
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,500
I remember back when I was a kid, I did some filler art for it.

1189
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,020
And you had your wonderful, wonderful, wonderful insect porn comic.

1190
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,040
I'm glad you remember that story.

1191
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,140
Of course, it was not considered porn, although insect human sex did take place in the story.

1192
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,200
Oh, yes.

1193
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,820
Bug.

1194
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,200
But of course...

1195
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,420
Brr.

1196
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:06,920
Yes.

1197
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,460
Well, I'm glad it affected you on a visceral level.

1198
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,720
And that comic story is now in obscurity because no one reads those comics anymore.

1199
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,420
But I would say that the comic still has the potential to exist.

1200
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:33,300
A potential in embryo, still waiting to be born, endlessly gestating until enough popular interest causes the resurrection and the re-germination of life.

1201
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,100
Oh, yeah.

1202
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,480
And we who endure the endless winter of public indifference...

1203
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:38,860
Oh, yes. One day. One day.

1204
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,320
...must have...

1205
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:54,600
...a little bit of faith that at the end, life once again will germinate in the raw soil and the re-fecund earth will flower in a fluorescence of literature, comic books, and the graphic novels.

1206
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,480
And this young man will once again find slack.

1207
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,640
Slack.

1208
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,240
Or maybe not.

1209
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,860
You said that on the radio.

1210
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:07,060
No, thanks for the nice words about my comic book story.

1211
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:07,800
Oh, yes.

1212
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,380
I guess he will.

1213
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,300
When I got...

1214
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,580
When I got into that, I was only about 16 at the time.

1215
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,980
I wasn't even legally old enough to read the comic, but I drew for the comic.

1216
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,080
Well, and it affected you in some way, you're saying?

1217
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,020
Oh, yes. I would say it affected me vitally.

1218
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,980
Now, I'll have to tell that to Mr. Saul, who also worked on the same story.

1219
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,440
Yes. Thank you so much. I now remember the name. Thank you for that input.

1220
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,780
His name was Ron Saul.

1221
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,240
Ron Saul.

1222
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,200
And the story you refer to was entitled Galloping Insect Phobia.

1223
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,200
Yes.

1224
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:53,240
Well, what do you know? There you are. Radio makes connections out of the past, just as if radio were MySpace, YouTube, or...

1225
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,040
Brain memory.

1226
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,060
Where are that you now?

1227
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,100
That's where radio goes now.

1228
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,360
Twitter, Flutter, Tatter.

1229
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,820
Radio is just like that.

1230
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,280
Tatter, yeah.

1231
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,920
It's like a thing that makes voices come out of the air.

1232
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,260
I know, it's magical.

1233
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,520
It's weird.

1234
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,220
When I was little, I thought...

1235
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,220


1236
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,220


1237
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,220


1238
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,220


1239
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,340
There were little people in the radios doing the sound.

1240
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,440
LinkedIn, Shutout, YourFace, .com.

1241
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,340
And the next thing you know...

1242
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,340
And the name of it?

1243
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,680
Next thing you know, you've got a big box of chocolates, 30 different kinds inside of it.

1244
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,420
A box of chocolate.

1245
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,600
You're just going to start at one end and work your way to the other.

1246
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,240
And you don't even care what flavor you get.

1247
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,720
Well, I care.

1248
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,020
And it's definitely hard...

1249
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,600
You don't even tell where the caramel is.

1250
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,620
You're going to eat them all anyway, so...

1251
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,660
But no, I only want the caramel.

1252
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,360
But once you open one, you have to eat it, even if it's a chocolate-covered cherry cordial.

1253
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,580
Even if it's...

1254
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:50,580


1255
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,460
Choke, retch, coconut.

1256
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,280
The worst of them all.

1257
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,380
Don't let me stop!

1258
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,220
How about some whorehound drops?

1259
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,420
See, this is a man who for sure makes a candy little child.

1260
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,300
Oh, that cocoa butter.

1261
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,280
Better like...

1262
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,220
Yes, that cocoa.

1263
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,220


1264
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,220


1265
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,220


1266
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,220


1267
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,720
Cocoa butter has a hypnotic power to put you under my commandment.

1268
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,300
Oh, yes.

1269
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:22,320
And then after years of inactivity, I can reanimate these sleepers with a special code word that comes in that 3 a.m. phone call.

1270
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,420
And if he does it once...

1271
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:30,180
You pick up the receiver, and while you're still groggy, before you have a chance, before your mind can make a defense, I give you...

1272
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,340
Sigm...

1273
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:32,800
Similacrum...

1274
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,680
Sim...

1275
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,180
Seven.

1276
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,260
Seven.

1277
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,880
Seven?

1278
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,220
And if he does it once, he can do it again?

1279
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,340
That's right.

1280
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,420
I can do it any old time I want.

1281
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,620
But if he does it once...

1282
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,380
Yeah, I might not choose to do it, so you gotta treat me nice.

1283
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,140
You have to do it at least once.

1284
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:50,980
At least for the first time.

1285
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,500
What was that?

1286
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,360
Speak into the rectifier.

1287
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,160
Rectifier?

1288
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:55,240
Oh!

1289
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,480
Not that close.

1290
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,720
My rectal voice can only be so high.

1291
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,860
Well, uh, you...

1292
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,760
Do you have a large collection of these comic books?

1293
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,200
I did.

1294
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,200


1295
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,200


1296
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,940
I had one. Then I got burglarized, and most of them went poop.

1297
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,740
So, burglars took them, eh? A likely story.

1298
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,760
Yes.

1299
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,400
Burglars took them.

1300
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,580
I only have what's in my memory.

1301
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,620
Burglars took his comic books.

1302
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,620
Burglars took my mind.

1303
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,000
Burglars would want comic books.

1304
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,700
Like your mom took your comic books.

1305
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,740
I had a junkie take my comic books.

1306
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,220
Oh, my mom got me into the comic books. Don't get me started.

1307
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,660
My mom...

1308
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,400
She flattened him between the comic book pages.

1309
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,360
My mom took my comic books and threw them in the trash once.

1310
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,180
Dad gave my dog one.

1311
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,820
Oh, my mom used to be a editor...

1312
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,420
And I snuck out there and got him back.

1313
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,200
Good for you.

1314
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,200
And Milo the Overman turned to rock and roll.

1315
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:44,880
And you...

1316
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,520
Praise God!

1317
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,860
Praise God!

1318
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,580
Hail God!

1319
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,420
Hail God!

1320
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:04,420
And, uh, for more information about the Church of the Subgenius, I want you to, um, do whatever you want.

1324
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,680
Got that pencil ready?

1325
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,340
Post Office Box 181-417.

1326
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:21,360
That's Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1327
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,220
44118.

1328
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,100
Here in the U.S. of A.

1329
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,700
And we welcome all the new stations that are now playing the show.

1331

And, uh, happy new month and year.

1332
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,780
Yes, yes, yes.

1333
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:44,420
Technically, I know it.

1334
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:51,920
