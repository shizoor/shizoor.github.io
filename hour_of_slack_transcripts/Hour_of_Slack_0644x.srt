1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,920
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,440
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,140
Ah, yes, dear friends, this time we're really back.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,300
And this is the first show that I've actually sat down and done, as far as being an hour of slack, since X-Day, friends.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,340
The X-Day that, let's face it, didn't happen.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,040
At least, I assume it didn't happen.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,960
I sure hope that this is not my escape vessel.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,560
But, you know, friends, we're crazy and it doesn't bother us to trust in Bob for...

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,120
Don't worry, Bob.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,120


12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,660
X-Day 1999, July 5th.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,960
That's when Nostradamus said it was going to happen anyway.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,640
Friends, and I'm going to attempt...

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,820
This is going to be a strange show.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm going to attempt to explain to you what happened in the very last minutes before 7 a.m.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm going to play the audio from videotapes of the moment at Brushwood, New York, at 7 a.m. on X-Day.

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,680
When, yes, it's true.

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,740
Yours truly, Reverend Stang, did, in fact, have to face the music.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,520
Well, let's get on with it.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,960
This one's going to be tricky because there's a lot of cussing in these videotapes on this audio.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,860
I'm going to narrate this so that you can sort of see with me what's going on.

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,520
But I'm going to have to cut some cuss words majorly, friends.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,060
But, uh...

25
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,780
So let us, uh...

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,920
Let us proceed.

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,680
All right, then.

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,680
Hey, friends!

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
X-Days are coming!

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,840
And the pigs are coming!

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
This tape starts at midnight the night before.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,080
It is now 12.01.

33
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,060
Half the audience is on the stage.

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,320
There's like 200 subgeniuses.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,080
It's the day dawned.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,760
The pre-X-Day.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,500
It's 12.01.

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,860
X-Day's here, baby.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,620
And this is what you're doing at midnight.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm not kidding.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
It looks like a scene from hell, friends.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,680
There's several large women partially dressed in what can only be described as breasts and, uh, uh, butts.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,980
And men are having simulated sex.

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,300
Okay, now it's the next morning.

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,500
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,120
The white...

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,700
The huge white stretch limo has pulled up outside the, uh, enclosed pavilion area.

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,040
There are 400 subgeniuses standing there.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,240
They're standing around.

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,520
Uh, Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, myself, and someone else just exited the limousine,

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,440
um, carrying a dummy of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

52
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,620
Um, th-th-th-th-and it's-it's...

53
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,060
Things are not too confused, surprisingly.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,940
Don't drink that stuff!

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,580
It's unkilled!

56
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,460
Exactly 7 a.m.

57
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,020
I guess the time master is, uh, I hope is still alert.

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,940
Um, the lovely Friday Jones is dis...

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,720
Dispensing, uh, Kool-Aid.

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,940
And, uh, I believe someone else...

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,720
...exactly at 7 a.m. will take the hit and say,

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,900
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,000
You see what I mean about the cuss words, friends?

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,480
And hopefully we'll be on the saucers by the time that damn sentence is fitting.

65
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,760
I don't know about you, but...

66
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,640
Friends, the, uh, stage is decorated with huge Dobbs heads.

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,380
Jesus is in his robe.

68
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,300
Papa Joe Mama is in a Nazi outfit.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Ten more minutes until...

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,200
Until rupture, children.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,580
That's Papa Joe Mama.

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,980
He is up on stage helping me to leave.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,140
Ready at 666.

74
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,060
We're trying to, um...

75
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,220
Trying to, we're, we're, we're help...

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,340
We're trying to organize dispensing the Kool-Aid.

77
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,480
People are lined up.

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,420
The subgeniuses are drinking down...

79
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,480
Well, they haven't drank it yet.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,040
They're getting Kool-Aid in little cups.

81
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,780
Hey, I don't know if y'all heard,

82
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,820
Has there been anything on the news about

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,880
cities in Europe being, uh, destroyed or anything?

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,900
Has anybody tuned in?

85
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,380
I'm dressed in my trademark quiet preaching suit.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,360
I honestly don't know whether...

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,380
We're in the future or the past.

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,960
I can't clarify that statement for you.

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,840
I brought something with me.

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,980
I'm gonna have to shut this up.

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,240
I wanted to bring the original...

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,720
Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

94
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,120
The sound wasn't working right.

95
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,920
I didn't want to bring the original Dobbs head.

96
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:52,920


97
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,740
I see.

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,420
This is the original handwritten note

99
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,660
in J.R. Bob Dobbs' own hand

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,100
written... that he wrote in a bar in 1953

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,980
that, uh, that says,

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,860
The world ends July 5th, 7 a.m., 1998.

103
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,700
This is the original piece of paper touched by Bob.

104
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,980
That was a pretty awesome thing to hold, friends.

105
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
This, this little crumpled note,

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,820
like a...

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,200
25, 45 years since Bob first received the

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,020
immaculation from Jehovah One

109
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,140
that, that the Exodus would come

110
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,660
in, according to my seven minutes...

111
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,940
I suddenly decided to take my watch off

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,060
and smashed the hell out of it

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,960
against the pulpit.

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,940
That was a...

115
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,860
I just didn't... I felt like...

116
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,460
I just didn't need a watch anymore.

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Unfortunately, then we didn't have anything to count down with.

118
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,240
Right in the crotch, today!

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,760
Right in the crotch, you mother...

120
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,660
There's a lot of really drunk subgeniuses out there.

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm displaying the original note,

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,200
a blow-up of Bob's original note

123
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,640
that said the world ends July 5th, 1998.

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
7 a.m., July 5th, 1998.

125
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,540
So this is just a few minutes before the end of the world.

126
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,760
Eight minutes?

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,840
Eight minutes.

128
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Oh, there we go.

129
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,660
Goddamn!

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,520
These things keep flipping up.

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,220
So did y'all hear what I said?

132
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,520
Yeah!

133
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Okay.

134
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,320
Fuck out.

135
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
Hey, how about this?

136
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,220
It took three days to preach and I'm still talking.

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,980
It's a miracle that I didn't lose my voice.

138
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,820
That's Sister Susie the floozy.

139
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,800
She should be up here.

140
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,080
Oh, God.

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
Susie the floozy comes up and joins the gods.

142
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,280
Where's... where's my doctor?

143
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,680
Dr. Legume and, uh...

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,500
She's a god. I just...

145
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,640
Ed Strange and G. Gordon Gordon

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,880
were burning their membership cards

147
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,680
and just came up to the pulpit...

148
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,000
Seven minutes?

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,280
...giving me the ashes of their membership cards.

150
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,000
How did you know, Dr. Legume?

151
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,180
What'd you find out?

152
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,440
Hell no, I said.

153
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,460
Come back home.

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
We got seven minutes.

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,520
What's... what's that...

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Burn my membership card.

157
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,120
They wanted me to burn my membership card.

158
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,360
They were really drunk and they...

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,160
None of these people have actually read any of our books.

160
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,960
Legume...

161
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,580
I actually just got a new card on me.

162
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,160
I just saw it.

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,920
I suddenly realized I'm glad they did that

164
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,380
because I realized that I was not actually carrying my membership card.

165
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
I'd left it in my car.

166
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,640
So I ran away from the stage to go get the membership card.

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,820
Um...

168
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,600
Legume thought that he was gonna be trapped on these saucers

169
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
with all those nerdy subgeniuses.

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
He did not read his book very closely.

171
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,920
It's a moot point since the rupture didn't really happen.

172
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,480
This is your last chance.

173
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,920
Burn it. Burn it!

174
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,420
Don't be like me and remember to check your card.

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,640
Most of these people had been up all night long.

176
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,280
Well, I'm not going.

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,920
But I'll be glad to burn this dollar bill

178
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,620
so the exes will be able to know where to home in on you.

179
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,900
You folks.

180
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

181
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,840
Fuck no!

182
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm not getting on them saucers with you fucking people.

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,700
Dr. Legume does not have as high a regard for the subgeniuses as I do.

184
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,460
As the smoke from this dollar bill is still rising up to heaven,

185
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,380
the invisible space monsters that really are there

186
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,720
know that there's still something down here on Earth worth saving.

187
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,680
I think Dr. Legume and some of the holocaustals wanted to stay behind.

188
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,620
Get the first filled out membership card.

189
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I was displaying my membership card.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
It's one of the...

191
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,940
It doesn't even mention my priestesses.

192
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,560
That's how you know I'm not a holocaustal.

193
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,700
A 1980 subgenius membership card.

194
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,160
While you folks are all up here in the attic trying to make sure you get out,

195
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,860
I just saw a subgenius heading to the bathroom to take a shit.

196
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,440
Who's got more faith?

197
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,680
Friends, this roof will be...

198
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,540
This roof is going to be blown off the top of this building.

199
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,260
How long do we have?

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,220
How's everybody got their...

201
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,100
Five minutes.

202
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,400
Susie the floozy is looking beautiful.

203
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Children, let's not be rowdy rowdy...

204
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,940
I can't describe the Susie the floozy X-Day outfit.

205
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
...dispensing the Kool-Aid.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,620
I've been wanting to say that for years.

207
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,200
If you have perfect trust and faith, you will be ruptured.

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,860
Don't worry. Trust us.

209
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,980
They did, too.

210
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,520
The Kool-Aid is just symbolic, friends.

211
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,660
You don't have to worry about it.

212
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,420
You really can't afford the Kool-Aid.

213
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,920
I'd like to point out that that one accident the person had when they touched their tongue to the Kool-Aid,

214
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,000
that was because that person was epileptic.

215
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,760
It had nothing to do with the Kool-Aid.

216
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,960
Popes Lilith is up there on stage.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,480
I mean up at the top.

218
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
You can take out that money and burn it now, folks.

219
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,220
There's no more use for it anymore.

220
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,080
Now down to officially three minutes.

221
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,480
In 35 seconds.

222
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,580
Yeah!

223
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
Friends, it was exciting.

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,140
It was really exciting.

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,700
You know, considering that most people had not slept.

226
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,500
Get some sleep.

227
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,900
That was all I wanted to do as soon as I was ruptured.

228
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,480
I wanted to get a bed.

229
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,620
You know, because the moment of rupture, you will become what you want to become.

230
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,800
And I hope you want to become.

231
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,560
Praise God.

232
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,300
Yeah!

233
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah!

234
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,620
Woo!

235
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,640
There may be a few Holocausters out there that want to remember this.

236
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,820
I mean, behind just this kind of mop-up troops.

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,980
But we don't want to miss out on all the fun.

238
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,980
So we might kind of have to join, you know, say goodbye to the Evangelicals for a few hours.

239
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,060
Because you want to kind of be involved with the actual...

240
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,160
We're not going to all end up...

241
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
This is the last we'll probably see of each other for a few hours.

242
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,040
But hours will be meaningless in a few minutes.

243
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,540
Oh my God.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,440
We need something that we can count down with.

245
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,200
I just smashed mine.

246
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,240
It looks like it's two and a half minutes.

247
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,260
Two and a half minutes.

248
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:48,680
Two and a half minutes.

249
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,140
Work, Willie!

250
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,760
Now, two and a half minutes.

251
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,000
Two and a half minutes as Bob sprawled on his original note.

252
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,440
The world ends July 5th, 7 a.m., 1998.

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,080
That was the first time I noticed something odd about that note.

254
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,500
Papa Joe Mama is examining the note at this point.

255
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,040
You can see on his face...

256
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,060
What are you talking about?

257
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,540
What the fuck?

258
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,900
You're not giving stuff back?

259
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,180
Man, oh, by the way, hang on to any Earth artifacts you have.

260
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,220
They will be very rare.

261
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,640
And, uh, important...

262
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh, yeah.

263
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,060
We have enough of them to stay in our lives.

264
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,720
We're in the hotline.

265
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,140
Everyone will be back at us.

266
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,000
You don't have a choice.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,700
Like you...

268
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Poor legume.

269
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,340
He's gonna be sitting there trying to stay down here on Earth so he can kill more pigs.

270
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,240
Poor superstitious bastard.

271
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,520
Okay.

272
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,160
One and a half...

273
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,540
Don't give him shit!

274
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,560
Could this really be one and a half minutes?

275
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Where's Jesus?

276
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,100
Man!

277
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,920
Nobody recognized Jesus because his beard was mysteriously removed in the night.

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,020
I don't know where...

279
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,720
Like I say, I can't tell you where we've been.

280
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't...

281
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,900
Honestly don't know whether it was the future or the past.

282
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,560
Uh, the Lord and I and our wives had disappeared during the night.

283
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,340
The final minute.

284
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,460
The final...

285
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,700
Wow.

286
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,020
There's some good looking women up there on that stage.

287
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,060
And some really ugly guys with cool costumes.

288
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Um...

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
Wait, now we're down to...

290
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,300
Did everyone sign that last will, by the way?

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,380
That's just a joke.

292
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,780
Everyone at the camp...

293
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:15,900
I don't know.

294
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


295
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


296
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


297
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


298
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


299
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


300
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


301
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


302
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


303
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,900


304
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,040
I don't know, people at the camp had to sign a last will and testament before we gave

305
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,800
them the Kool-Aid.

306
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,160
Everybody got their Kool-Aid!

307
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,000
And we're getting down to 40 seconds.

308
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,940
More Kool-Aid!

309
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,160
Thirty five seconds.

310
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,600
Hey!

311
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,260
Kool-Aid!

312
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,240
Three...

313
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:40,100
Watch the camera, 30 seconds, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23...

314
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,900
No, it's 20!

315
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,920
21...

316
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,880
I wanted so much for the X machine.

317
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:45,880


318
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:45,880


319
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,460
this to rupture us all up to our escape vessels, friends.

320
00:12:49,760 --> 00:13:02,880
30, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

321
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,660
Suck up if they can't take a job!

322
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,400
All those subgeniuses have their arms and tape decks raised up waiting to be ruptured and then nothing happens.

323
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:29,980
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

324
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,160
Suck up if they can't take a job!

325
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,500
Well, um,

326
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,300
friends, I wish you could see the close-up of my face.

327
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,820
Why has Southport sacked me?

328
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,740
Uh, triple their money back!

329
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
And of course they're instantly already calling for triple their money back.

330
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,960
Father Joe Mama just noticed that the 1998 on the note has been taped in and upside down.

331
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,880
It had originally said 86-61.

332
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm showing the note.

333
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,780
Papa Joe is questioning the note.

334
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,800
Susie the floozy looks over my shoulder and sees how the year has been taped in upside down and gets the most...

335
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,140
She gets the most horrified look on her face.

336
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
What do we miss?

337
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,320
The year 8,861?

338
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,340
The world ends July 5th, 8661.

339
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,640
That's not for sure. That's just a theory, friends.

340
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,080
But, uh, you can see...

341
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,300
I was horribly confused and shocked at this point myself.

342
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,060
Susie is crying. Susie the floozy is crying.

343
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,780
Jesus looks disturbed.

344
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,140
He didn't change the... When we started talking about this, he didn't jump in and mention any changes.

345
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,060
I was getting a little scared at this point, friends, because people were starting to call for my blood.

346
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,520
Maybe swing another needle. I don't know.

347
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
I mean, it said he could swing another needle.

348
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,840
Hell, we might have to... Fuck. I don't want to have to do this again next year.

349
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm afraid we will have to do it again next year.

350
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,020
There's no reason that we can't keep up the spirit, though, children.

351
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,840
I know that there's a lot of pocket calculators out there. Somebody do the math.

352
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,160
How many more seconds until 8,661?

353
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,920
No, I can't. You're wrong.

354
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,560
The mood of the crowd is turning.

355
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,860
I was wondering what that other apostrophe was doing.

356
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,220
Ed Strange is making a hand-mincemise over on the side.

357
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,780
Let's get around.

358
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,560
Are you... Are...

359
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,520
Are you...

360
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,580
This watch can't be right.

361
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,460
He had a new pamphlet?

362
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,340
Then he meant 707s.

363
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm going back to the story that...

364
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:58,680
I'm just saying, I don't have... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but if some explosions don't start exploding soon,

365
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,220
I have a feeling that somebody up on this stage...

366
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm not saying no, no, no, no, no.

367
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,500
Maybe we all better just kind of...

368
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,960
...dance in opposite directions.

369
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,760
You know what?

370
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,820
You know what?

371
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,280
You know, as far as the eternal salvation goes, that's when you die.

372
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,580
Okay?

373
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,500
We promised two utopias, one before your dead and one after your dead.

374
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,440
You don't get your money back until you, you know, until you can prove you didn't get eternal salvation.

375
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,380
That may take a while.

376
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,080
Uh-oh.

377
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,220
Dr. Legime and the Luciferian Liberation Front just...

378
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,160
...the fucking charlatan!

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,820
...suddenly the Luciferian Liberation Front guy, who's like a Green Beret, grabbed me.

380
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,540
And they're physically restraining me, yelling at me.

381
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,280
Gee, Gordon Gordon is helping.

382
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,840
Quick, we need some women up here!

383
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,480
Dr. Legime calls a bunch of women come up happily ripping my clothes off.

384
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,180
Get up! Get up!

385
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,620
Someone else, my wife, Reverend Friday Jones,

386
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,740
the new Christ in a Bucket, or Christy Liv and Christina Bucket,

387
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,860
and Susie Dufluzzi are stripping the clothing off of me, forcibly,

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,040
holding me down while they pulled my t-shirt off of my head.

389
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,360
These girls thought this was real fun.

390
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,100
...and never have to pay it back.

391
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,640
I've just worked here my very life.

392
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh, and the rabbi is up there helping to strip me.

393
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,160
I've...

394
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,080
Every day, I was stripped and thrown into water by women.

395
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,020
Any last words, Ivy?

396
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,460
Uh, during that weekend.

397
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,780
I'm trying to hide my nakedness behind the pulpit at this point.

398
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,780
There's a man with a Satan mask in the crowd, standing there in the foreground.

399
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,060
And, oh no! This is...

400
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,860
Then they pull out the honey, a big jug of honey.

401
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,400
And Dr. Lagune poured this huge thing of honey over the top of my head.

402
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,860
Joe Mama said it was...

403
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,600
Joe Mama said motor oil, and that's what everyone thought it was.

404
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,840
And then they dumped, friends!

405
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,140
Here I am, stark naked, covered with honey, and they dumped a bag of pink feathers on me.

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,280
Bright, day-glow pink feathers.

407
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,120
So that I looked like a little naked chicken.

408
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,620
A little half-foot chicken.

409
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,980
Um, totally humiliated in front of 400 subgeniuses.

410
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,920
All of you shit-or-actions just line up here on the side of the stage.

411
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,580
Hey, stay!

412
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,080
We'll make sure that this world will end with a bang, if not a whimper.

413
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,800
Friday Jones comes up and tries to wipe the honey out of my eyes.

414
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,540
And Jesus wiped his wept.

415
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,780
Oh, and Jesus is helping to wipe my eyes off.

416
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,200
Having honey in your eyes is a strange sensation, friends.

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,280
We want our money back!

418
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,520
We want our money back!

419
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,740
We want our money back!

420
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,940
We want triple one, three, four, and three!

421
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,180
Um, Christina Bucket, Christ in a bucket, I mean, is comforting me.

422
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,460
Beautiful, uh, young lady.

423
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,040
And, uh...

424
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,380
Careful! Careful! Careful! Careful!

425
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,940
I finally... There was nothing to do but cry.

426
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,600
Jesus held the mic up to me and I just bawled like a little baby.

427
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,980
And, uh, everything would have been fine at this point, friends, except that, um...

428
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,680
Go to the showers. Put that in.

429
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,800
I wanted to go to the showers.

430
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,300
But...

431
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
My mom! My mom! My asthma has forsaken me!

432
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,940
Um, unfortunately, someone got the bright idea to throw me in the pond.

433
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,660
And that is what subsequently happened, friends.

434
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,680
You know, I was looking for a last minute porno movie.

435
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,500
Poor little naked stang.

436
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,400
I ended up trying to run away to the showers.

437
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,340
I think that's as close as we're gonna get to him volunteering to bend over and take it where it counts.

438
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,360
I'm afraid Bob did that to me some twenty years ago.

439
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,100
I got one request.

440
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't throw this piece of shit in the pool. I gotta clean the pool.

441
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,740
Throw this asshole in the pond.

442
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,520
Thanks, Rhino.

443
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,060
It was one of the Brushwood staff suggested throwing me in the pond, and that was it.

444
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,740
I tried to run away, friends, and, uh...

445
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,040
This is Popes Lilli.

446
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,180
...that Bob had that note and was writing it out, and then just got distracted.

447
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,840
The note got turned upside down, and he did write down 1998 upside down!

448
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,300
And monkeys might fly out of my butt!

449
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,300
Listen to this!

450
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:43,760
Woo!

451
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,380
Ends dateline for dominance.

452
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:54,620
At the very end, you have the chart of time outlining the events that are going to be occurring in the past and the future of this universe.

453
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,440
And there, it clearly says July 5th, 1998.

454
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,760
Exes arrive underneath.

455
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,740
It says the year 2000.

456
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,740
Exes depart.

457
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,580
As far as we know, the exes are, in fact, here.

458
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,100
They're just not making themselves known to us.

459
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, that's a hopeful feeling.

460
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,240
Of course, Jesus...

461
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,340
Ladies and gentlemen...

462
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,380
...happened to be ready.

463
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,200
Not that I was prepared and didn't have faith and, uh...

464
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,720
Yeah, all right.

465
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,920
...was prepared for this in any way.

466
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,140
Of course, down to the wire, I thought we'd be ruptured.

467
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,320
But just in case, we have prepared for you...

468
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,460
I have prepared for you.

469
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,840
Bob has prepared for you...

470
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,780
the new official subgenius sticker.

471
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,840
Only $2.

472
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,200
July 5th, 7 a.m.

473
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
It's all purpose.

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,920
There, that'll give you some free...

475
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,980
Jesus was selling bumper stickers already...

476
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,820
...with the year removed, friends.

477
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,580
Okay, I give you free.

478
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,120
Now it's $2 a piece.

479
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,680
In all of the subgenius pamphlets where it used to say 1998, it now says...

480
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,820
...soon.

481
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,640
I think nothing should be mentioned that if this man actually winds up in the pond...

482
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,920
If y'all recall, we had a little incident in the whirlpool a few nights ago when someone laid a turd.

483
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Oh, my God.

484
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,500
But that pond, I think, has got more than a lot...

485
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
More than just one or two turds in it.

486
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,240
I think that's kind of where the sewage winds up.

487
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,700
Free and safe.

488
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,900
How appropriate.

489
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,600
There's leeches in the pond.

490
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:38,100
Yes, friends, I spent the next half hour or so start naked with 400 people laughing at me.

491
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,800
You know, it's...

492
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,420
That's what most people would consider a horrible nightmare.

493
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,180
The nightmare of slugging through mud while 400 people point at your nakedness and laugh.

494
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,560
To me, that's just a memory.

495
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,100
Into the pond.

496
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,160
Friends, I tried to run the other way.

497
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,220
Into the pond.

498
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,660
And...

499
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,340
Into the pond.

500
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,600
But the girls themselves caught me and dragged me down and the whole crowd just...

501
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,160
He has to go into that pond.

502
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,300
I tried to run.

503
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:09,840
Friends, I...

504
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,800
Should I continue with this tape and...

505
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,240
And play the humiliation of poor Reverend Stang, the...

506
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,060
The...

507
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,940
The charlatan, the fraud.

508
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:28,160
Finally, in the end, after they had mocked me and berated me and mocked my nakedness and so forth...

509
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,000
And said, triple your money back a thousand times...

510
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,120
Uh...

511
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,220
The guy in the devil suit, Satan, came down and said...

512
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,740
Stang...

513
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,100
I'm still on your side.

514
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,740
You can come with me.

515
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,140
I'll help you out.

516
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,800
And I was helped up out of the pond finally by Satan himself.

517
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
Um, friends...

518
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,260
You know...

519
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,000
The...

520
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,260
Well...

521
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,800
Actually, I guess what I should do now is take this tape over to the subsequent devival.

522
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,220
Believe it or not, two weeks after this terrible failure, this...

523
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,560
This...

524
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,000
This...

525
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,300
Non-rupture...

526
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,860
And humiliation.

527
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:21,820
Two weeks after that, I was back at Sherman, New York at Brushwood Campground for the giant Starwood Pagan event.

528
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,160
Um...

529
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,800
And did a devival there with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

530
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,240
And that's where I...

531
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,060
Uh...

532
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,060
Tried to explain our take on...

533
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,600
On this...

534
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,420
This problem.

535
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,640
This X-Day problem.

536
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,500
And, um...

537
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,520
And our faith that...

538
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,560
Sure, if X-Day doesn't happen on...

539
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,660
Double X-Day...

540
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,520
Dos Equis...

541
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,560
In 1999...

542
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,820
Uh...

543
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,400
Perhaps it will happen on Triple X-Day...

544
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,960
Um...

545
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,000
The year 2000.

546
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,940
We may have to have a party every year...

547
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh, God...

548
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,560
Friday Jones herself pushed me into the water there.

549
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
A poor, pathetic...

550
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,800
It...

551
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,380
It...

552
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,100
The pond was very smelly, friends.

553
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,660
And, in fact, I've had an illness ever since that day.

554
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,800
I didn't get it in the pond.

555
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,300
I had it before then.

556
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,540
But I've been suffering from that.

557
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


558
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


559
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


560
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


561
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


562
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


563
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


564
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


565
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,000
It's like vertigo.

566
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
Quite badly.

567
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,360
I feel like I'm spinning right now.

568
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm...

569
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,340
I'm down there in the water trying to wash the honey out of my face using this stinking,

570
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,220
rancid water.

571
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,560
I cried and wept.

572
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,280
Only now in the end do I understand.

573
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,700
I do still believe, friends.

574
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,120
Look, poor little naked stone.

575
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,180
As Father Joe Mama said, it's true, he only has one.

576
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,100
Where the fuck am I?

577
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,120
That's where I used Jayner's one.

578
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
I remember us in seventh grade trying marijuana for the first time.

579
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,840
Woo-hoo!

580
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,420
Well, friends, it went on for a while.

581
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,060
There was a...

582
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,360
You know, of course, more movie quotes yelled out from the crowd.

583
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,260
I got mad and yelled at them.

584
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,620
I ended up finally just...

585
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,400
I may be being baptized in shit, but that's nothing compared to what you fuckers are gonna

586
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,100
have to deal with.

587
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,780
Maybe we got the math wrong or something.

588
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,520
I don't know.

589
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,400
Hey, it's not my fault.

590
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm not Bob.

591
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,140
Yes, you are.

592
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,840
I just...

593
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,340
You believed in two.

594
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,340
Show us Bob.

595
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,240
I've been placed down with fucking peps.

596
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Show us Bob.

597
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,260
Where is the Bob?

598
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,260


599
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,260


600
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,260


601
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,260


602
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,260


603
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,160
Bring him before us.

604
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,720
Shoot a wad for Bob.

605
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,120
Shoot a wad for Bob.

606
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,900
Feed him to the beast.

607
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,880
Show us Bob.

608
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,620
There is even a model flying saucer burning on the little island in the pond.

609
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,620
Hey, Stag, you're alone in feathers.

610
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,600
Hey, Stag.

611
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
I got your saucer right here.

612
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
They're in a balsa wood and paper just like the church.

613
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,480
Maybe they're just small.

614
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,460
Maybe they're just small.

615
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,500
balsa wood and paper saucer being burned in disappointment.

616
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,440
What goods has sex got us that little?

617
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,780
My dreams of excess escape going up in plums.

618
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,620
I've tried to leave the pond, it was really cold.

619
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,620
This is up in ski country and it's quite cold at night there.

620
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,820
You know the thing is, it was as if Bob never existed.

621
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,000
They took it all out on me as if there were no Bob Dobbs,

622
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,560
as if I was the one who came up with all this crap.

623
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,560
And then triple your money back.

624
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,240
That's uh, that triple your money back is for when you're dead.

625
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,100
I'm trying to get out of the pond and the girls push me back in again.

626
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,100
Is this enough humiliation for you?

627
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,440
Hell no!

628
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
I was really getting cold.

629
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,480
Show a handstand!

630
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,840
And looking sad.

631
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,120
Well actually friends, I'm in better shape than most 44 year olds,

632
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,160
so it wasn't that embarrassing.

633
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't look too bad.

634
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,940
I'll just rip my clothes off if you don't look at my face.

635
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,100
I still believe it goddammit!

636
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,000
I still believe in Bob!

637
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,340
I still love Bob!

638
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,240
This was just a test!

639
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,480
Bet you had a test!

640
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,060
You just wanted, I'm the only one who passed the goddamn test!

641
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,120
I'll bet you!

642
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,380
I got you Bob!

643
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,060
Here!

644
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,700
You guys fucked it up!

645
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,240
It's sad!

646
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,380
If you had faith!

647
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,260
If you had faith they would come!

648
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
This show's your faith!

649
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
You fucked it up for me goddammit!

650
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,740
Oh that's so sad.

651
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,700
Did John the Baptist have to go through this?

652
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,500
Did Moses and Jesus have to deal with this kind of crap?

653
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,700
Did Bob ever have to mess with these yo-yos screaming at him like this?

654
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,420
You better hope you don't!

655
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh man.

656
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,260
You better hope you spike the fucking Kool-Aid!

657
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,700
There, see?

658
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,700
Where's your Kool-Aid now, Kool-Aid man?

659
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,540
No, you're just on your way!

660
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,920
I transubstantiated your...

661
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
Well friends, I...

662
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,600
There, as you can see, I'm a little bit more of a...

663
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,680
I mean as the camera pans over the crowd of all kinds of people.

664
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,020
The subgeniuses are, you know, comprised quite a cross-section of people who...

665
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,560
Some of them even look sort of normal.

666
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Uh.

667
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:56,880
So, friends, on side two of show we shall now proceed onto the much slicker and better produced subgenius devival at Starwood.

668
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,480
You motherfuckers have me mixed up with Bob fucking Dobbs, don't you?

669
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,520
You motherfuckers never...

670
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,100
You motherfuckers never once believed in Bob!

671
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,480
You fuckers thought Bob was a goddamn piece of clep art and nothing more, right?

672
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,660
Admit it! Admit it!

in Bob's honest autonomy

681
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,180
Your finger tips set holdin' fire

682

Everlastin' sweet desire

683
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,680
If you matter what the doctors say

684
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,760
You're a man you steal away

685
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,000
Immortality for two

686
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,500

All you gotta do is take his hand

703
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,820
Remember what Ivan says

704
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,980
As the man inside the head

705
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,220
Finger drips and hold his fire

706
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,220
Everlastin' sweet desire

707
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,160
The Faith Healer!

708
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,600
You can never escape the eyes

709
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,380
The eyes of God watch you wherever you go

710
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,060
Can I put my hands on you?

711
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Can I put my hands on you?

712
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,540
Can I put my hands on you?

713
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,140
Can I put my hands on you?

714
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,920
Can I put my hands on you?

715
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,060
Can I put my hands on you?

716
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,320
Can I put my hands on you?

717
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,460
Can I put my hands on you?

718
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,620
Can I put my hands on you?

719
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Can I put my hands on you?

720
00:33:51,740 --> 00:34:01,180
Can I put my hands on you?

721
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,360
making your periodic heartbé

722
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,380
Can I put my hands on you?

723
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,620
Can I put my hands on you?

724
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,780
Can I put my hands on you?

725
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,980
Can I put my hands on you?

726
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,880
Can I put my hands on you?

727
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,340
Welcome to the revival of Rose Ivan Stone.

728
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Praise Bob!

729
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,580
Let's get right to it.

730
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,160
I want to hear a moment of sacred noise.

731
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,040
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

732
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,520
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

733
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Goddamn Bob.

734
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,680
Oh, and the fucking Bob, too.

735
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,500
We'll praise all of the Bobs.

736
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,840
Friends, I wasn't supposed to be here today.

737
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,260
I was planning, like every other subgenius,

738
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,600
to be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

739
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,740
Don't interrupt.

740
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,940
I know, maybe we are on them.

741
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,440
There are 180 excuses for X-Day on the Internet already.

742
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,640
Personally, I believe that Occam's Razor, usually,

743
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,500
which says that the simplest explanation is usually the best,

744
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,260
Bob fucked up.

745
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,140
I know, I know that it's hard to imagine

746
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,240
that a holy man like J.R. Bob Dobson,

747
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,160
would lie or fuck up.

748
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,360
I know, I can't believe that Bob would fuck up,

749
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,720
but that may be it.

750
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,180
Maybe that's what happened.

751
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,820
Maybe that's why the X-Ess didn't arrive

752
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,660
two weeks ago on X-Day.

753
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,340
I'm not going to explain any of that to you.

754
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,920
You can pick it up from context.

755
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,140
But friends, you know,

756
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,900
remember that little nutty religious cult

757
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,720
in Garland, Texas?

758
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,220
The God Salvation Temple.

759
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
Poor little teacher, Chen.

760
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,500
They were from Taiwan.

761
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,960
You've heard about them, I'm sure.

762
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,360
They actually, that silly end of the world cult,

763
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,580
was right down the street

764
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,660
from where our skyscraper office is.

765
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,160
Really is.

766
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,460
And they had been predicting that the world would end March 31st.

767
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,740
I think God was going to be on TV and so forth.

768
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,160
And those poor, silly cultists,

769
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,780
duh, they were so wrong.

770
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,440
And the media laughed at them and made fun of them.

771
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,620
And friends, I remember standing on this very stage

772
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,020
six months ago saying,

773
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,460
well, we don't have to worry about being like those idiots now, do we?

774
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,900
And friends,

775
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,180
two weeks ago,

776
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,580
we did the countdown.

777
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,560
7 a.m., the exes, the aliens,

778
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,740
did not show up.

779
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,480
I'll admit it.

780
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,660
They took it out on me.

781
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,200
People don't believe in Bob.

782
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,100
They have to, you know, kill the messenger.

783
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,060
So they stripped me down

784
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,860
and tarred and feathered me.

785
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,660
Poured motor oil and feathers over me.

786
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,360
Threw me in that pond down there.

787
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,240
Friend, did you ever have that nightmare

788
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,100
where you dream that you're slugging through the mud

789
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,600
and you're naked and everybody's laughing at you?

790
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,720
Well, the next time I have that nightmare,

791
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,360
it'll just bring back fond memories of a fun party, dear friends.

792
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,900
And I'll tell you something.

793
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,940
Sure, our prophecy may not have come true.

794
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,700
Maybe Bob fucked up that one time.

795
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,800
Uh, but you know what?

796
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,020
We're religious nuts!

797
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,620
We don't care if Bob...

798
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,280
Bob could suck up a hundred times

799
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,460
and we'd still show up here at Brushwood

800
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,060
waiting for those blind saucers

801
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,480
and having a hell of a party.

802
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,580
Did Bob...

803
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,300
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses stop coming to your door just because their world didn't end every time?

804
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,960
Last time I noticed, they were still at my door.

805
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,200
Well, are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses be bigger religious nuts than us?

806
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,580
Say no!

807
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,840
We are the biggest religious fanatics in the world, and we will wipe out all other religious fanatics.

808
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,080
But, friends, I guess what that brings us to,

809
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm afraid that, of course, there are many provisos for why Bob's prophecy might not work out,

810
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,820
if you read the fine print in Revelation X,

811
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:14,780
but what I think people forget is that, you know, we can make up all these excuses

812
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,840
why we aren't on the saucers of why Bob's prophecy fucked up,

813
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:26,520
but maybe some of you did not read the very first sentence at the very top of the first pamphlet number one,

814
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,060
Prophetic.

815
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,320
Printed in 1979 in Dallas, Texas, and I don't mean where it says $1, friends.

816
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:38,300
At the very beginning of the very first pamphlet, does it say the world ends July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.?

817
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,720
No, friends.

818
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,760
It says the world ends tomorrow!

819
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,120
Tomorrow!

820
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,760
And you may die!

821
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,180
In fact, I promise that every single person here will die!

822
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,700
Now, are you living your life as if it was the last day on Earth?

823
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,140
Some of you may be!

824
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,940
Some of you probably are living your life like it's the last day on Earth.

825
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,040
How many of you are living your life as if you've got all the time in the world?

826
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,480
Well, that's just as good!

827
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,280
Friends, the point is, you know, sure, Bob Dobbs may have fucked up,

828
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,780
but what does that say about all those other religious leaders?

829
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,200
I mean, if Bob's gonna fuck up, what does that say about...

830
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,140
Well, I don't want to name names.

831
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,860
Jesus, uh, I'm tired of bad-mouthed Jesus, because he works for me now.

832
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,360
Couldn't be here instead of sending his blessings to everyone.

833
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:42,080
But seriously, friends, obviously, there was, and I've been saying this to subgeniuses for a while now,

834
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:50,960
the mystery of X-Day may, in fact, be an important lesson that many subgeniuses desperately needed to learn.

835
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,860
That lesson might be, don't believe everything you read.

836
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,900
And don't depend on Bob!

837
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,460
That was his whole point!

838
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,940
He does not want a bunch of cripples leaning on him!

839
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,320
He, he's trying to get you.

840
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,980
It's like, okay, he depended on a holy man.

841
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,980
He fucked up.

842
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,560
So what are you gonna do about your escape vessels now?

843
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,320
I think the message is, build your own ship!

844
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,420
That's what it is!

845
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,640
The X's may show up, uh, in 350 days.

846
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,300
Uh, those X's.

847
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,900
X-Day.

848
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,400
1999.

849
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,420
Like Nostradamus said.

850
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,780
But we can't depend on that!

851
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
All of those holy men may be liars and cheaters.

852
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,160
Even Bob!

853
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:43,680
So therefore, are we gonna sit on our asses and pray for some benevolent aliens to come down and save our butts?

854
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:43,960
No!

855
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,940
Build your own ship!

856
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:52,640
And while we're working on that, if you think about it, we're on our own ship right now.

857
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,460
Unfortunately, we're all on the same ship.

858
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,060
And it's not the same ship.

859
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,920
It is badly in need of repairs.

860
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,620
So let's work on the spaceship that we're riding on right now!

861
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,440
Get the motherfucker fixed up.

862
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,820
And then, we shall conquer the universe.

863
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,440
Praise Bob.

864
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,440
But, of course, the conspiracy...

865
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
Say, boys...

866
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,940
Maybe we could do some, uh, scary music.

867
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,540
Yeah.

868
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,560
Do you guys know how to play any scary...

869
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,040
We'll work on it right now.

870
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,360
Okay.

871
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,800
Um...

872
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,260
Now, speaking of wishful thinking...

873
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
The, uh...

874
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,040
I'd like to share with you something called the keys of magic.

875
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,880
There are a lot of people here that call themselves magicians, right?

876
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,420
I mean, well, maybe they're all the humorless ones that stay away from these.

877
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,860
I don't know.

878
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,460
But, um, you know, I, uh...

879
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,060
Certainly, magic is real, but...

880
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:59,160
Judging by its practitioners, sometimes I think belief in it maybe defeats the purpose.

881
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,060
And, uh...

882
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,980
You know, we...

883
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,140
There are a lot of, uh, subgeniuses that...

884
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,400
Are sort of, uh...

885
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,380
Pathetic and...

886
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,380
Sad and disgusting and...

887
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,000
But they're not nearly as bad as the Scientologists.

888
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,540
I got hold of the most expensive Scientology newsletter.

889
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,040
The cheaper Scientology newsletter.

890
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,360
I've ripped them off myself quite a bit.

891
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,740
The ones that you get if you're a $15,000 a year Scientologist...

892
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,400
Are written like Dick and Jane books.

893
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,660
Uh, for first graders.

894
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,140
Because that's the kind of person that will spend $15,000 a year on Sci-

895
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,500
On Scientology.

896
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,980
Now, a typical testimonial from the most well-trained Scientologists went like this.

897
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,140
I have a fa-

898
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,880
I had a fancy bicycle that I kept in my garage.

899
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,020
And I was like,

900
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,660
One day someone stole it.

901
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,460
Using the techniques I learned from Scientology...

902
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,760
I drove around my neighborhood and found my bike.

903
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,840
Praise L. Ron Hubbard.

904
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,140
Now friends, that guy spent $15,000 to find out what I'm about to tell you for free!

905
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,620
That guy was using one of King Bob Solomon's keys to magic.

906
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,960
The first key!

907
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,340
And there's only four of them. They're very easy to remember.

908
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,340
The first key to subgenius magic...

909
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,280
Get off your ass.

910
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,120
You wanted a girlfriend?

911
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,060
Talk to a girl.

912
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,840
You hate your job?

913
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,260
Quit your job and get a new one.

914
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,360
Just get off your ass.

915
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,420
That's the very first step, the first key to magic.

916
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,500
Number two key to subgenius magic...

917
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,140
Is bust your ass.

918
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,860
Number three key of subgenius magic...

919
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,940
Is get others to bust their asses for you.

920
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,780
Which we call...

921
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,860
Ass...

922
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,740
I guess we call that assholism.

923
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,160
And uh...

924
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,420
The fourth key...

925
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,900
Watch your ass.

926
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,240
And if you watch your ass, no one will kick...

927
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,500
Oh wait!

928
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,220
There is in fact a fifth key to magic, more important than any of those others,

929
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,660
brought to us by the great Saint Red Fox.

930
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,820
And that is not watch your ass, but friends...

931
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,360
Wash your ass.

932
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,000
That will get you further.

933
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:19,360
In some cases, some of you lonely people, you'd be surprised what a little effort at personal hygiene would do for you in your life.

934
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,440
Now...

935
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,360
We all uh...

936
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,940
We're always, you know, talking about slack.

937
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,760
This is the church of the subgeniuses devoted...

938
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,260
Of course, everyone knows it's Bob and he teaches slack.

939
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,840
Well...

940
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,200
Well what is this slack stuff, you say?

941
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,820
And you go, oh I know slack isn't that conspiracy bullshit where life is a Miller beer commercial and every...

942
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:51,420
You have slack if you just drank a 12 pack, your team just won, and all the girls around you look like MTV bimbos and all the guys are buff jock assholes.

943
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,780
Then that's really slack.

944
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,880
Well we know that's bullshit.

945
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,320
Then you go back to your stinking job the next day and it's...

946
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,440
Well we know better than that, but some of us go, yeah man, like slack, that means like uh...

947
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,240
What Beavis and Butthead do, right?

948
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,940
You like get stoned, watch TV and eat all day, right?

949
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:06,960
Sure!

950
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,760
That may be slack for you, but being cheated out of your life by the conspiracy may be your idea of slack.

951
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,600
The difference between us and them is we won't tell you what it is!

952
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Because it's different for every fucking one of you!

953
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,920
And if we could bottle it and sell it...

954
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,200
We would be the conspiracy and it would be up to you to kill me now!

955
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,920
I am not bottling and selling it!

956
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:34,420
In fact, if you come up to me after this and say, Reverend Stang, I saw your show, I paid money but I didn't get slack,

957
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,520
I would have to say, sir, you will never get slack because you will never be able to understand Bob's message.

958
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,220
You have to make the slack yourself, build your own ship!

959
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,540
And here's the point, friends, slack is not necessarily laziness.

960
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:57,100
There are some of us, we call ourselves the emergent tile subgeniuses as opposed to the rewardians.

961
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:09,480
I love the rewardians, friends, but some of us, some of us get slack when we are working so intensely hard at what we wanted to do!

962
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,080
Not the slave labor, but what we wanted to do.

963
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,880
That you get so into it that you may go without sleep for days.

964
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,060
You may even go without drugs for days.

965
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,240
You may...

966
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,800
You just develop this concentration, right?

967
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,380
You're flying, you're in the zone, you're cruising on what you're doing, you're really into it,

968
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,480
and suddenly you become sort of more smart for a second.

969
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:38,380
And you realize that you are God, life really is incredible, an amazing miracle,

970
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,540
the rust streaks on the side of your car are prettier than anything hanging in an art museum,

971
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,080
and life really is more psychedelic than that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

972
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,420
Now, hold that thought!

973
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,260
Hard to do.

974
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,980
Because, uh, the conspiracy has a secret weapon, friends.

975
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,140
The conspiracy has this invisible monster.

976
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:16,780
Now, polls have been done that indicate that 87% of Americans, this is just in America,

977
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,120
really believe that there is an invisible giant monster in the sky

978
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,300
that will do favors for you if you kiss its ass enough,

979
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,800
and will curse your enemies if you kiss its ass enough, basically.

980
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,420
Now...

981
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,580
Friends, I...

982
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,020
Just because there doesn't happen to be an invisible monster there,

983
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,100
as long as 87% of the dumbasses believe in it,

984
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,000
we still have to deal with it!

985
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,120
And that is why we, the Church of the Subgenius, have decided...

986
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,920
Now, friends, this is kind of harsh,

987
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,660
but we have decided to declare war on God!

988
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,780
War on God, like Jason and the Argonauts did!

989
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,700
By God, we shall...

990
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,260
Because what kind of a God is it that is so weak and so pathetic

991
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:11,120
that it has to be defended by illiterate little old redneck ladies against assholes like me?

992
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,360
That is a sick God!

993
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,040
A guy can do better with a piece of clipart

994
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,620
than those idiots can do with their so-called God!

995
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,960
Do they have a photograph of him?

996
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,280
Hell, they don't even have clipart.

997
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,900
So...

998
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,060
Friends, if you've obviously...

999
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
We're no different from all the other religions.

1000
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,580
It's not really that we love Bob all that much,

1001
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,660
it's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell forever!

1002
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,340
That's what religion says!

1003
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,040
That's what it's really all about!

1004
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,980
Oh, yes!

1005
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,880
And friends, we here as subgeniuses, looking around at each other,

1006
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,820
hell, you may look at the next one over and go,

1007
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,580
God, I don't want to be stuck on a spaceship with that nerd!

1008
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Friends, it's true!

1009
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,780
Most of us actually have nothing in common,

1010
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,440
except that we have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normals!

1011
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,380
And...

1012
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,280
You know, sure, I'll admit, maybe we're kind of queer for Bob.

1013
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,660
I'm queer for Bob, but...

1014
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,300
And this is something many of you may have wondered about.

1015
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,680
Yes, many of us in the hierarchy of the Church of the Subgenius are...

1016
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,680
Bisexuals.

1017
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,380
That means, when you go back there and buy our shit, we come!

1018
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,440
You buy, we come!

1019
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,220
Thanks, Bob!

1020
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,520
Thank you!

1021
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,420
Bob, Bob, wherever...

1022
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,240
So friends, uh...

1023
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,340
You know, what we're offering is the same thing everybody else is offering.

1024
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,520
Something for nothing.

1025
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,360
But!

1026
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Think about it.

1027
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,200
Money.

1028
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,460
You know, money.

1029
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,640
We're getting money from you.

1030
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,680
Well, what is money really worth?

1031
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,640
Ask Elvis Presley, or Michael Jackson, or Madonna.

1032
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,940
It's meaningless to them, you know?

1033
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,120
But what they wouldn't give for some slack!

1034
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:02,940
Slack!

1035
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,640
Man, now that is something!

1036
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,060
Money is nothing but slack!

1037
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,320
Slack is something!

1038
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,900
And friends, slack is what you need!

1039
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,800
Now, there are many people here who are thinking,

1040
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,480
Man, Reverend Stang, that's easy for you to say.

1041
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,000
You get paid to preach to drunks in nightclubs.

1042
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,020
But, believe me, I know how it's like.

1043
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,460
Some of you here are, uh...

1044
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,120
Funny looking.

1045
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,240
Some people here are what you might say...

1046
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,360
Too fat!

1047
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,720
Or too skinny!

1048
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,260
Or have bad teeth!

1049
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,860
Or have a mental impairment of some kind.

1050
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,000
Some have physical problems.

1051
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,420
Some of you, um...

1052
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,240
May just simply be socially awkward.

1053
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,820
Clumsy.

1054
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,180
Not a people person.

1055
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,140
Not a team player.

1056
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,760
I know because I have been all of those things

1057
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,040
and hope to be all of them again all at once someday!

1058
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,560
But...

1059
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,120
And in your case, many of you may have become so accustomed to solitude

1060
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,280
that you don't really...

1061
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,360
You know, you don't need an encounter group, support group

1062
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,020
for fucking weirdos and Trekkies that read too much.

1063
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,540
You really just...

1064
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,280
You don't care about your fellow subgeniuses all that much.

1065
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,220
You really just want to be left alone.

1066
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,460
And here's the miracle of the Church of the Subgenius, friends!

1067
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,880
You can be alone...

1068
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,980
With Bob!

1069
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,940
You think about it!

1070
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,100
Every other personal savior...

1071
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,760
No, they don't...

1072
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,300
Being a short duration personal savior isn't good enough for them.

1073
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,540
They've got to be your only personal savior

1074
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,400
and they're always leaning over your shoulder, questioning,

1075
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,360
Were you cool enough today?

1076
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,740
Did you make enough money today?

1077
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,700
Did you kiss my ass and pray enough today?

1078
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:45,980
Friends!

1079
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,320
Bob Dobbs does not give a shit about any of that stuff!

1080
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,560
Not at all!

1081
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,620
He does not care about your sins

1082
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,500
because he is not equipped to forgive your sins.

1083
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,300
He doesn't think you need to be forgiven.

1084
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,840
All you ever needed was an excuse!

1085
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,120
Bob brings no forgiveness!

1086
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,280
But he brings the greatest excuse!

1087
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,060
And that excuse is Bob!

1088
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,720
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

1089
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,380
Whoo!

1090
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,000
And friends, that's why we say...

1091
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,340
Sure, we may be drunk or neurotic, brain damaged,

1092
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,420
fucked up, funny looking...

1093
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,840
But we've got Bob and they don't!

1094
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,180
And so that we can hate them!

1095
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:24,880
Hate them!

1096
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,160
Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!

1097
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,980
Pretty good!

1098
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,360
Come on, man!

1099
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,620
I dig the vibes!

1100
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,300
Drink the Kool-Aid, children!

1101
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,760
All right!

1102
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,480
I got 300 people to chant hate at Starwood.

1103
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,160
That's not bad.

1104
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,980
Two weeks ago we had 400 people line up to drink Kool-Aid at 7 in the morning.

1105
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,400
All of them at 7 o'clock.

1106
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,540
We did the countdown.

1107
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,920
Three, two, one...

1108
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,140
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1109
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:02,740
And...

1110
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,700
I had to prove that I could take a joke.

1111
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,520
But, uh...

1112
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,140
Friends, the slack is all around you.

1113
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,660
You're floating in it.

1114
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,280
You're floating in a sea of pills, as Jane or Hyperglyphs used to say.

1115
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:23,900
You're floating in a veritable ocean of Bob's best pills and best smoking admixtures.

1116
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,880
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb, and taste-dead to know they're there.

1117
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,320
Because, hell, for all I know, maybe we are on the escape vessels.

1118
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,020
And we're just...

1119
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,540
We just don't have faith.

1120
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,180
But!

1121
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,080
I won't accept that!

1122
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,000
I want my escape vessel!

1123
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,500
I want my slack!

1124
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,520
And I'm willing to wait another...

1125
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,740
If I have to, goddammit, I'll wait another 350 days.

1126
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,800
And that brings me to a very important point, my friends.

1127
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,820
You may be fucked up, ugly, poor, and broke, and hopeless.

1128
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,620
But!

1129
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,880
You probably only need to hang in there for one more year!

1130
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,500
Surely Bob and the escape vessels will be here in a year.

1131
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,640
So that's all you have to do for slack.

1132
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,500
You're not gonna be able to defeat me.

1133
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,920
You're not gonna be able to defeat the conspiracy on your own.

1134
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,060
And the whole Church of the Subgenius...

1135
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,860
Not this year, I don't think.

1136
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,160
But!

1137
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:20,400
Every little decision you make is part of the termite digging away at the foundations,

1138
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,500
tying together the shoelaces of the Colossus.

1139
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:31,180
And as much as it would do the Church a lot of good, financially, with publicity,

1140
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,460
like everybody here would commit suicide while wearing a Bob t-shirt, or...

1141
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,580
If you do what you always wanted to do, take that machine gun to a McDonald's full of schoolchildren...

1142
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,380
Don't do it, friends.

1143
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,080
As much as that would help our Church...

1144
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:48,980
Don't do it.

1145
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,980
Don't go postal.

1146
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,560
Don't kill them, and don't kill yourself.

1147
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,400
That's all you have to do!

1148
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,180
That's all you have to do, friends, is stay alive for another 350 days.

1149
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,160
That is the message.

1150
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,320
That's more important than getting your idea of slack.

1151
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,160
It's more important than quitting your job.

1152
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,660
It's more important than any of the other things.

1153
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,480
Just hang in there a little bit longer.

1154
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,960
You don't know what the future may hold.

1155
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,740
It sure as fuck surprised me several times over.

1156
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,460
So, friends...

1157
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:25,800
So, friends, we come down near the end of this show, this old show,

1158
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:35,820
and that was the Subgenius Devival at Starwood Festival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

1159
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,640
That Devival was beautifully recorded and is on a DAT tape,

1160
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,380
and we may turn it into a CD at some point.

1161
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,600
It goes on for another half hour, so sorry about all the cuss words

1162
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,640
and the fact that I'm going to have to remove them for most copies.

1163
00:55:52,700 --> 00:56:00,160
Friends, you can get it all, the free information about everything, from Subgenius.

1164
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,300
You can write to Bob or the Hour of Slack or Church of the Subgenius at

1165
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,340
gotthatpencilreadyfriendspobox140306

1166
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:20,380
That's box140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1167
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,360
That zip again, 75214.

1168
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:31,800
Or you can always check out www.subgenius.com.

1169
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,280
You can hear the show on the air.

1170
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:35,280


1171
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,600
You can also listen to it on the internet, in fact, by hitting there.

1172
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,540
You can try to email slack at subgenius.com.

1173
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:54,280
And, friends, this Einstein's Secret Orchestra music in the background is not helping my vertigo.

1174
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,200
Seriously, I'm suffering from an inner ear infection or something like that.

1175
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,660
It makes me dizzy and vertigious.

1176
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,780
I don't know what's going on, man.

1177
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,340
I just wish them axes had shown up.

1178
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,760
Bob at box140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1179
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,040
Praise Bob and thank you.

1180
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,100
Thank you, Bob.

1181
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:53,620
Thank you very much in advance.

1182
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,620


1183
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,620


1184
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,620


1185
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,620


1186
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:54,760
Mmhm.

1187
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,220
Exactly.

1188
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,220


1189
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,220


1190
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,220


1191
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,220


1192
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,500
Besides us, I'm Joe and Bob not Bob, uh, anymore.

1193
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,260
And I just want to remind you that the faith has nothing to do with people anymore.

1194
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,260


1195
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,440
My priests keep telling me that's all Wayne craft done, over and over again.

1196
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:03,500
Just out all of this pretty good.

1197
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:03,980
So, well, I don't know when to miss one, but it's gonna be the time as it comes.

1198
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,000
Be cowboy, Mr. Spock.

1199
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:17,160
Secret Orchestra at P.O. Box 81555. That's a new P.O. Box for them. P.O. Box 81555. Cleveland,

1200
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:31,340
Ohio 44181. That zip code once again 44181. Einstein Secret Orchestra. P.O. Box 81555.

1201
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:45,640
Cleveland, Ohio 44181. And I ate one. If you can't beat them, friends eat them.

1202
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:31,300
P.O. Box 81555.

1203
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:54,320
P.O. Box 81555.
