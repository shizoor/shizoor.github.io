Your attention, ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
Announcing the arrival of the...
The Genius Power Bros.
What?
I don't like it, Joe.
Yeah, me too.
We'll just have to sweat this out.
Handle whatever it is when it happens.
Joe, maybe if you went to him and said that you had a change of mind about...
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
You make me sick.
Tell Bob.
Let's bring it to vertical one more time.
I get to be another dumb American mime.
Miles and miles and miles I go to get a word with whether conspiracy heads are dreaming like a jerk.
People pushing, collating, checking the mail.
What the hell going on here?
Pink belly, pink belly, pink belly, pink belly.
People pushing, collating.
Checking the mail.
Peter Cushing, soul critic.
The stupid emails.
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines.
But I don't want to be so into the squalid red lines.
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess.
What the hell going on here?
I just gotta...

The oblivion of work is often interrupted by work.
But my favorite greats, which seems to never abate, as of late awaits a whole other day
when the space freight of the potential multiple may derive from this world I hate.
And on that day I'm gonna party like it's 1998.
No one more pink nosing or whoring.
All we'll be doing is soaring throughout the doors of perception, riding past the waves
of deception.
No word of reception into the arms of the goddesses.
It's beyond description.
What the hell going on here?
Heartache.
Lack.
It's 1998.
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines.
But I don't want to be so into the squalid red lines.
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess.
I just gotta...
What the hell going on here?
Work.
I just gotta...









I just gotta...
Work.

C-C-C jeans.
Okay, I got the Fallavana hat on.

M-my top.
Let's ring me for the wild Alsace.
Oh...

STILL inufenwoven, at least, doves, n著 hen we're nearby!
Hmm...
What do we have...
L lag.
Co-Lading, checking the mail
Table pushing, Co-Lading checking the mail
Peter Cushing, Soulcrating the stupid emails
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines
But I don't want to resort to the Scarlet Red Line
So I can fly with all this stuff daily I guess

Often I feel like a ghost
Insubstantial
Drifting

Amidst waves of dumb circumstance
Living dead
Glimpses of life but

Pink belly, pink belly.
And with that song, Pink Belly,
we welcome Reverend Norell Preff to Hour of Slack.
In this case, the Hour of Slack number 913.
And there's a lot more where that came from.
As Reverend Norell Preff sent us a whole CD-R full of MP3s that he did
under the name Heavy Confetti.
And, in fact, that's www.heavyconfetti.com.
In fact, there'll be another one of those right after we stop talking to ourselves.
Submarine or something.
Huh?
I don't know. I was just talking to myself.
Yeah, me too, man.
Man, I'm having trouble following anything tonight because the devil.
The devil is...
The devil has gotten in there because they let the devil come in.
At Halloween, they just open their hearts to the devil.
He's looking behind every dumpster.
Now, what are you talking about?
I'm going to die, Jesus.
And I'm going to get so drunk I forget about Bob.
And I'm going to grow a single horn from my head.
And let the demons speak from my navel.
Actually, I wish I could get that excited about Halloween.
But, you know, it's a whole wow Halloween.
It's a special day.
You act like somebody you're not.
Like a Frankenstein?
You have a...
You say...
You pretend you're someone else.
You have a disguise all day.
What is the purpose?
You say you act crazy.
Oh, man.
Well, it's a special day.
Yeah, I understand.
Maybe for some people it is.
It just isn't the same when you do it.
You know, I used to love Halloween.
And yet now it's...
Now that I do it every day.
Oh, the first time I...
Now that every day is Halloween.
Ah.

Norrell Preff, friends.
www.heavyconfetti.com
You ain't heard the last of him.
Now, friends, we all,
we all talk about Bob.
But do you have faith, friends?
Do you really have faith?
I'm going to tell you how much faith I have.
I have faith
that by the time
I leave this revival tonight,
Bob will have given me
a new car.
The Lord giveth,
somebody giveth,
me he taketh away,
and Bob laughs and laughs and laughs.
And he ain't laughing with us, friends.
And on the way back from Ex Day, I think,
perhaps it was that chair sitting in the middle of the highway
that we ran over coming around a curb.
It caused a little oil leak that later caused a little other thing.
And the I-van, the van that the church,
the church van, my friend, the church van, it went down.
I wish I could say it was the church van.
It was a conspiracy that put that chair there,
but it was probably one of my fellow subgeniuses.
He didn't strap it onto the pickup or something.
It all goes around, comes around.
I probably got that person's $30
and they destroyed my oil pan
and they destroyed my engine.
But I know that Bob,
I don't even have to worry about this.
In fact, we just crashed Princess Wee's car
because we have so much faith.
We did it for fun.
Because I know,
then I will be,
somebody will come up to me and go,
God damn it, before I sober up,
I'm going to use this title.
God, we need, Bob's right.
People, they don't dare to say it.
But it's true.
There really is a conspiracy of normal people
ganging up against the weirdos and abnormals.
It's been going on since the beginning of time
and it will continue.
And it continues even among the subgeniuses.
Who beat up even the weirdos among them.
Who happen to be the ones with nice haircuts
and jobs and, you know,
no speech impediment at all.
The beautiful, handsome people,
the pretty people,
the lucky people.
Oh wait, no, that's Bob.
If it's Bob, it's okay.
See, boys, it's not queer if it's Bob.
From the Indie Bible,
praise God.
Quee-gee-bo.
And now, well, how about that Rush Limbaugh?
Although glass house dwellers shouldn't throw stones.
We've all had bad habits.
But Mr. Sister here in Cleveland
got hold of this incredible private recording, friends.
A private recording of Rush Limbaugh losing it.
Oh, I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
What's the matter?
You feel, you look depressed.
Are you depressed?
There's no reason to be depressed.
Do you want to work here?
You've got to stay alert.
Do you know how to do that?
Take a pill.
You don't want to be alert?
You like the fog?
Okay, fine.
Take a pill.
We've got pills for you to sleep just like that.
You want to maintain an even keel?
No ups, no downs?
Take a pill.
What is this pure chemical attitude for?
Taking pills.
Everybody takes them.
Doctors, lawyers, butcher, baker, candlestick maker.
Everybody.
Why do people feel so bad about feeling good?
Why can't they just take a pill?
Pain.

I guess this is the
Norrell Preff special show.
But now, for a few cuts,
let us slide back into
the world of Mr.
Fernando Nandeli

pills.

Okay. Okay, I'm a little
bit high. Oh, no!
Yes!
Yes!
Mom thinks I should be in jail.
Why does Bob
want this woman in jail?
I'm beginning to smell a big
fat commie rat.
Why would you do that
to me, Bob?
They try to make you
comfortable. They try to put you
in a
quite nice situation
with food that look
like, look more like
a dog food. Food
for wild animals.
Alright?
, okay.
This is the truth.
Huh? Oh, we're almost done.
Yeah, we're in the plan.
CD truth?
All spread out.
Like, naked.
Me and my girl Amy
and Chris
and Amanda.
We're all spread out in the plan.
Yeah. Here in Tremont.
Naked. Yeah.
Listen to your show.
Yeah. Oh, man. Under the
stars. Have the girls climb on the speaker.
Turn the bass up all
the way. Oh, man.
No.
There's no masturbation or anything.
There's just like
really good vibes, you know.
Cause it's like almost
after the half moon.
Yeah, I understand what that means.
Can you dig it? Yeah, this is terrorist talk.
This is double speak.
Okay, man. Yeah.
I think so. Yeah.
Or you know, alien. It could be alien
double speak. Well, it's
September 11th, and I, well,
no, it just finished being September.
It's not anymore. Now it's September 12th.
We're safe. So the balloon
has gone down. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
All right. I'll grant you point one.
He is planning, but what's
he planning this time of year?
Barley, lima beans, maybe and
or and or what and
marijuana or some other illegal
crop. You know, he just could
be. Hold it.
We are back. We are back.
Going strong. We got our guests here in the studio.
We've got.
We have got sacred scribe number.
I don't know what the number is.
So 73273. It's always either 273 or 278.
I'm sacred scribe number 273.
The prior 272 or.
It actually came to pretty bad ends.
Most of them. I've lasted longer than most.
Hmm. I don't know exactly what to attribute that to,
except for the fact that J.R. Bob Dobbs was killed during my watch.
So maybe it's been easier on me.
He's been killed a few times, though.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He came back.
It's you know, it's like killing Daffy Duck practically.
See, in those case, we don't.
Those Christians talk about how their savior died and rose for them.
You.
Jesus only died and rose once.
Right. Right.
Well, that's a lot.
I mean, I'm not that we don't mean to to demean his achievement.
I mean, somebody has to come first.
True. But I mean.
And he wasn't really even the first, but he had the best publicist.
Definitely. Apollonius of Tyana did it.
Yeah. Who knows about him?
If you haven't seen Seven Faces of Dr.
Lowe recently, you're out of the loop, dude.
This is.
Also with me, Dr. Howell.
And Dr. Howell and Owl, the toast of stage, screen and radio and that game Half Life.
Oh, yes. I recognize your voice immediately.
Actually, I keep waiting for you to say I'm waiting here for my colleagues.
Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?
Those must be lines from the game.
Yes, they are. Yes.
Yes. The secret passwords of those who know them.
Signifiers of a special and hidden bomb.
And well, we went to a revival in the neighboring state of Indiana in the town of Indianapolis.
There weren't no Indians. There weren't no apples.
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Just sprawling, dreadful urban waste.
Well, and the club.
Well, yes. And the club. Yes.
And it was full of girls.
And the girls. Yes. The girls.
And those beasts. There's lots of beasts.
True. Beasts.
And those beasts in Hofhorn and Skalihine.
The horrendous exemplars of nature gone haywire.
Okay. Does anybody else need to come forward and confess their sins and how the conspiracy
guilt demons live their ass?
Oh, there's at least one or two more people. All right.
All right. What is it that you, what's your name?
Stelio.
Okay. What is it that you have done that can use these conspiracy guilt demons in your ass?
That would be copyright infringement.
Oh.
You're gonna get the RIA suit in your ass, man.
I need you to do a superposition on the pulpit.
Are you ready for a healing?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, baby. Woo!
Woo, woo, woo!
It's Stelio.
Oh, do you feel the demons have left your ass?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Oh, this one. Oh, yeah.
Oh, man.
Banjo Bob!
Oh, yeah, the guilt demons are strong in this one, I can tell. Banjo Bob! What have you
done? The conspiracy guilt demons are inhabiting your ass.
A Banjo Bob.
That's a laugh right there, let me tell you.
Assume a position on the pulpit.
Woo!
Oh, I like those pants. Woo!
Oh, baby.
Banjo Bob.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.


Banjo Bob.
I hate this game.
You feel the conspiracy guilt demons have left.
Oh, you need more?
Okay, okay.
I'm dying.
Worms, worms, oh yeah, that's funny.
Oh yeah, they tell me to stop and they don't really want me to.
No, never stop.
Okay.
Reverend Nikki Deathchick at the Indianapolis Devival 2003 and now a rare recording of one
of the first ground breaking Dr. Bands.
A very, very special guest.

Spike Jones.

is the Swingin' Love Corpses in their latest ancient album,
The Bay Mix Keepers.

What about the government, um, um,
back at the Congress,
five billion in cash for the airlines?
The United States and its quest against them.
But dot, dot, dot,
Charlie P. Hinaway says,
U.S. diplomats say,
and it's in the mountains you can see from Yemen's capital,
where Western diplomats say,
thousands of Arabs who'd say,
trained and fought in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda
beyond the reach of government authority
just over a porous border with southern Saudi-A.
Suspects grew up.
Though the government has militant Islamist training camps
within its borders,
Well, there are obviously a number of cops
that have cops, cops, cops, cops.
Each night when I return the cab to the garage,

How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?
None. They screw in hot tubs.
Well, actually, there was an answer to that question.
It was something like 5,262.
5,260 to create the mass,
clustering compression shrinking machine,
and two to climb inside the light bulb.
Ooh, yes.
A subgenius joke.
Won a prize on a rock station about 25 years ago.
You see, the rest of you guys out there,
you're just not with it.
You don't understand the subtleties of this kind of humor.
You know, it's no wonder that we lose our patience with you sometimes,
because you just seem not to get it.
And it takes forever for you guys to come stumbling and halting away,
and to keep up with the rest of us.
Well, you gotta get on the ball.
Step up and hurry up, or we're just gonna leave you behind in the dust.
That's just the way it is.
Hmm.
This is lofty humor.
This is advanced, high-class humor we're doing here.
We're laying some high-class humor on you,
and you're just not picking up on it.
The lofty laugh in the dark.
The sneaker at the end of the bedpost.
Don't know why.
Where do people think they're, uh...
The chortle hidden in the basket of laundry.
We have them all, and you got nothing.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
I forgot to pull them off.
Oh!

Bob is coming, friends.
And by that,
I don't mean that Bob
Bob was somewhere else and is on his way here.
What I mean is Bob is coming.
When you come, that's Bob.
It's a gerund, Joko.
Bob is coming.
Yes.
It was only an allegory, that grinning face all the time
that you thought might represent something else
than what it represented, that moment of coital release.
That moment when the DNA gets its way.
When the floodgates are opened
and the biological imperative strides forth.
Man, this dirty talk is turning me on.
I'm getting all hot and bothered.
Perhaps you'd like to look at this,
the official Columbia University Journal of Paleontological Research,
page 272.
Look at that spiral.
I've never seen amino acids do that before.
Well, this caused the fossilifer,
this prong in the case of the randy coelacanth,
first documented by Dr. E. L. Brundage and C. R. Runciter
in their reports with abstracts of 1999.
The randy coelacanth.
Yes, it was in quite a priapic state for many millions of years.
It's a hard fish to deal with, my friends.
Yes, the natives call it ungabulo nota,
which means sucker.
Which is odd, since there are no suckers anywhere on its body.
But perhaps they were actually referring to its place
in the great chain of all things as a chump for God and nature.
It's a monster.
It's a monster.
I've seen a monster, Dr. Hal.
I've seen this monster.
Well, you know, to them, maybe you're the monster.
Did you ever think of that?
Yes, all the time.
Humans were the monsters.
God damn you all.
God damn.
A moment of realization searing a hot flash across our consciousness,
like the kiss of a whip.
This is the realization, the moment that you fear to meet
when you take that first great leap in the dark.
But it's all par for the course here on the Theological Information Highway.
We will relentlessly tell you the way it is,
and better you want to know that or not in the short time which has been allotted to us.

Hey, give us a call up here.
216-686-5105.
We can shoot the breeze.
Actually, we can answer any question.
That is correct.
That's right.
Any question.
Any question.
Anything that is personally burdening your heart.
Ask Dr. Howell.
Dr. Howell is a doctor, and you can ask him, and he will answer.
Ask, and it shall be answered.
If you live in San Francisco, you have to pay to go see the Ask Dr. Howell show every
week.
Well, ultimately, you will pay to know what you really think, but if you attend my nightclub
act, you will be immaculated and seized up in the rupture.
And given the wedgie of faith.
Well, it's been known to happen.
That's right.
Bob by proxy, a bob by direct action.
It's still the same footprint that investigators have learned to recognize over the years.
The large, dobsley presence can not be hidden from the adroit.
Here's a question about a dream.
A dream.
Good.
We shall interpret your dream.
I had a dream.
I was loved of Bob.
Loved is in quotes.
I see.
I was loved of Bob.


It was so real, I could feel his pipe on my neck.
What does this mean?
Grab your ankle, sir.
It means that you were loved of Bob only in the most mechanical sense involved.
If Bob's teeth are still clenched and his pipe is still in place, you are receiving
only his perfunctory attentions, which I might add are better than most people ever
get or feel.
But do not confuse the love of Bob with the love between subgeniuses.
The love for Bob and the love of Bob for the subgenius clutch are two different things
and must always be so if the love of Bob is to have any validity or meaning.
Well, in that case, Dr. Howell, we must ask, why do the colorless ideas infect Bob?
Why do the colors of Bob affect us so?
Well, more people like bland food than like spicy food.
And more people like lack of ornamentation than furious baroque ornamentation.
The fact is the intensity which you would think one who longs to live life would seek
out is just a little too much for most people.
Why is this?
Because it tells them somehow on a subconscious level that they are not doing enough.

And are not getting enough.
And so it's easy for a colorless and bland idea to slide over us.
But there will always be someone who will, perhaps spasmodically, perhaps psychotically,
but still inject in one magnificent convulsion a little bit of color onto the scene.
And of course I'm going to hit you.
Well, all right, Dad.
If you want to hit me, go ahead.
You're right.
What a great trick I...
I bet I can never get one to hit me again.
Yeah.
Huh?
Oh, gosh, you think a guy could have some fun on his birthday?
Good night, Wally.
You know something, Beef?
Thanks.
You're welcome.

Huh?
Oh, that hurt my heart.
Now it's your turn to strip the best skin that science has to offer.
Clinical studies show you can make pores visible and accomplish an overall blotchiness,
stripping the skin of essential oils.
Plus, luxurious and elegant wrinkles and age spots
like these cost a dime in department stores or salons.
But if you call now, you can try the complete blotching age spots for hundreds of dollars.
This deep cleansing lotion effectively removes skin cells and an overall smoother, younger-looking complexion.
That's right.

And now, Dick Strong by Norel Prep.
Is everybody all right?
Okay, here.
No, wait.
What happened to Dick Strong?
Wait a minute.
Didn't he accompany you two?
You know...
Dick, Dick Strong.
Hey, Richard.
Where could he disappear?
Sparky, we don't know.
You and I, he could have been swallowed up by a glacier.
Richard!
Dick!
Dick Strong!
Oh, Dick!
Dick Strong!
Dick Strong!
Dick Strong!
Dick Strong!
Dick Strong!
Dick Strong!

No use.
Dick Strong is gone.
We'll never see him again.
Dick Strong by Norel Prep.
Dick Strong may be gone, but Dr. Howell is here.
Here's a sort of a how-to question, I guess, in practice.
How-to?
How do you escape being reduced to conspiracy?
Conspirian, quote, entertainment, unquote.
That makes a lot of sense.
Well, it takes effort.
It's easy to come home, be beaten down, be tired out, turn on the television, let the
conspiracy gestalt have its way with your mind.
But try a simple experiment.
Just turn off the sound.
Provide the soundtrack yourself.
Now you're already a participant.
Soon you will be able to dispense with the picture entirely.
And provide all the programming available 24 hours a day on the inside of your eyelids.
Practice makes perfect.
And the way to avoid it is to make a little effort.
Because the conspiracy makes it easy to fall into its blockist soup, but hard to extract
yourself from its clinging, clammy, enveloping touch.
Whoo!
Whoo!

As that columnist in The Onion recently said, I've got an iPod player in my mind!
All right.
This is a kind of complicated question.
My right arm is much larger than my left.
How many times do we get questions like this?
My so-and-so is bigger on this side than my so-and-so on the other side.
I want to increase the size of the left arm, but it doesn't know how to love me right.
All right.










I'm going to be honest with you.


What should I do?
Well, this is like the picture of the classic redneck who, if right-handed, has an enormous
purple-veined, pumped-up right hand and a rather small, withered left hand.
The thing to do to get rid of this asymmetry is, of course, to take steps.
You might even have to lash your arm to your side.
But this, I think, is going too far.
Simply make sure that you are where it counts.
And the dexterous.
There is a natural tendency to balance out the length of your arms and the length of
your legs and everything else.
Remember, a man's reach must exceed his grasp.
Or what's a heaven for?
Before you're practicing with that left arm, though, don't handle these kinds of red peppers.
That's extremely important.
And I might also add, if you have had a runny nose, you might want to use a little bit

of Red Hand.

You're supposed to begin with a cactus.
Some of them have tiny little spines that you can't even see, that it takes weeks to
get out of your right hand.
This would be an excellent time to start practicing with your left hand.
Or you may end up in a world of hurt, or at least a continent of hurt or a large city of
hurt.
I can vouch that it can take up to 15 years for those little spines to re-emerge.
Horrible.
Those cacti really protect themselves.
Well, we have only a few more, so let's have them.
And then we'll be good to go.




I've been practicing not very well.

this man I think this may be a personal or generic I can't tell where where is
your third nipple
just on this question where is your third that's assuming there is yeah well
if there is it's internal but of course James Bond's enemy Scaramanga had a
third nipple many people have a third nipple Cicero the Roman order had a
third nipple my brother in fact has a supernumerary nipple yes you see
sometimes the God of all things is a little extra generous with what he gives
out sometimes the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away but remember what is
fair depends on where you are in relation to the mouth of the cornucopia
where are you in relation to your third nipple
consider not your third nipple consider your third nostril and the laborious
process which it will take to open it
we're all here because the Church of the subgenius the cult with personality
look in my eyes what do you see
cult of personality
I know your anger I know your dreams
I've met everything you want to be
I'm the cult of personality
Like Clarice Thomas and Pee-wee
I'm the cult of personality
the cult of personality
the cult of personality
I exploit you, still you love me.
I tell you one and one, make three.
I'm the cult of personality.
Like J.R. Bob's arms and Connie.
I'm the cult of personality.
The cult of personality.
The cult of personality.

By the way, our background music is the Swingin' Love Corpses,
courtesy of Dr. Philo Drummond from the Bay Mix Keepers collection.
And now, Limer.
Commander.
Speaking, Lieutenant.
Skipper, the chief's been murdered.
Murdered?
Yes, he was murdered.
He's dead.
How is it done?
Done?
Well, there's your answer.
What?
Lions and tigers and bears.
Renewing molecular sexnecks.
What's that?
No, you're wasting my time!
Ahhhhh!
Oh my!
Ahhhhh! Oh my!
What?
Oh my!
Oh, uh, someone's at the door.
Dr. Ivan Stang ran down, around and around the narrow Castle Tower stairs toward the door
to let in whoever has just caused the flashing light to appear.
Dizzying array of things disturbing.
Yeah, those, those, uh, things that shoot electrical bolts that are inside those big glass things.
I don't understand what they do, but they're very impressive and very high-tech looking.
I had to, uh, turn the bottle, uh, miniature sitting the bottle, or candor, or whatever it is.
Oh, so, candor.
Yeah, so, that was...
To make sure of nighttime and...
That was why you ran downstairs?
It wasn't because we had a special...
No, we were late!
It's like, uh, yeah, it was supposed to be nighttime for them a long time ago, and nobody
had turned the jar away from that.
It's like an egg.
You gotta turn an egg.
Right, exactly.
They won't have any more little baby candorians in there.
You know, if they did come out and get big, they'd all be, uh, incredibly super powerful,
so, uh, they deserve it.

They deserve to be kept, uh, on ice.
Right.
Yes.
This college radio station happens to have the bottled city of candor.
It had to end up somewhere, like Oswald's rifle.
We have that, too.
You know, these things just come, uh, one way or the other, and they end up in the collector's
room, trophy room, whatever you want to call it.
That Mannlicher Carcano ain't worth a hooey.
No, but it's a historical souvenir, and, uh, this here is, uh, supposed to be, uh, a, uh,

Cardinal Richelieu's pessary, it says, but it's hard to tell.
This brown, shrunken thing, I, it's difficult.
The years have not been kind to this artifact.
You know, I understand, uh, they also had an example like that from Rasputin, the mad
monk.
Well, he was a monk.
I didn't know if he had a pessary, but we've got, uh, uh, Jack Ruby's can opener.
No kidding.
We have it.
And John Dillinger's can opener, so I've heard.
Yes.
It's four and a half inches longer than, than Ruby's.
But, uh, you can see it right here.
It's part of the object collection from the sub-genius.
Keep it, keep it in the bag, man.
Yes.
Well, that's a church key that has opened many doors, I want to tell you.
See, we have these things.
We collect them because...
What's this cuck bottle that says Fatty Arbuckle on the label?
Oh, don't knock that pubic hair off the end.
That was the subject of a celebrated, uh, court case, uh, Arbuckle versus Arbuckle versus
Arbuckle.
But, you know, he was exonerated all three times.
Uh, that's not what history remembers, though.
No, because history prefers the sleazy reek of a good story.
You can get more of that here from WCSB.
Then this planet will be reported as unsuitable.
Repack the instruments and prepare for takeoff.
We will continue our search in another solar system.
And you can continue your search, dear friends, at upcoming sub-genius.
That's right, sub-genius devivals coming up in November.
Uh, just for your information, I should let you know that on Saturday, November 15th,
at Cleveland, Ohio, in the amazing Beachland Ballroom, there shall be an old-fashioned,
old-timey, traditional Cleveland devival with yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank, Lonesome
Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith, ESO, and a special movie show that I'm sure you'll
love.
And I'm putting together just to take advantage of the Beachland Ballroom's incredible screen
on Saturday, November 15th.
And then on Saturday, November 29th, in Detroit, Michigan, at the Magic Stick, the band heard
in the background, friends, the amino acids themselves, with yours truly, Reverend Ivan
Stank, and these other bands, the Christ Punchers, the Jollies, and MAN, that's a November 15th

show.
And on Saturday, November 15th, at the Magic Stick, the Magic Stick, in Detroit, Michigan,
just wanted to mention it.
Other information is available at www.subgenius.com.
If you happen to be listening from Europe, on November 22nd, Kennedy Day, there is a devival
in Amsterdam, Holland, with Pope Black, Pope Phil Monty, in the wake of Mickey Finn, and
Fred, and so many others.
Friends, it's a...
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.













You're not gonna tell those people you saw Martians running around down there.
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking!
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, and you can get more information about
the Church of the Subgenius from www.subgenius.com.
Friends, if you've got some kind of tape, you can use it to get your own copy of the

tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think is suitable, is suitably bobbed and
slacked up, and conspiracy bashing, and ear bone ripping, to play on this August radio
show, then you can send that to me, Reverend Ivan Stang, at this address, Stang at the
Post Office Box, 181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
44118.
44118.
That's Box 181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Hey, praise help.
Help you eat it back.
Run, run, run!
And you know, let me say this.
His number is 13013, and he also has an email address.
It's dub, uh, at dub, uh, dot org.
That's dub, uh, at dub, uh, dot org.
And, uh, uh, he's also got a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

It never gets any easier.
Never!
Well, I, I guess this is the end.
This is the end?
My only friend.
Well, folks, it's been, uh.
No, it's the end.
It's been, uh, insanity.
It's been mass madness.
And, uh, y'know, I hate to do this a half an hour before the next guy shows up, but
I just don't want to be here another half hour.
Can he start everything up again?
Yeah, but he'll have to go get the key from the Orbit.

And crank up the generator.
Plus, you know, I've got to be back here at 11 tomorrow.
Oh, good Lord.
It's been fun, folks.
Our guests have been Dr. Hal Van Alen.
Hi.
Reverend Ivan Sang in the background, not doing very much.
I drove.
He's done enough already.
Stumpy can drive good.
That's the janitor he's talking about.
He's resting on his laurels.
Yes, with hardiness, extreme hardiness.
It's starting to get a little soggy, so it's time to get up.
Princess We Are Doe has fallen sound asleep.
Well, I know where she's coming from.
I'm going to get some shut-eye myself right about now.
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
Well, you heard it here first and last.
This has been a special extra-long edition of the Synesthesia program,
and we hope you'll be here next week,
except for...
You assholes that have been calling the last hour.
Yeah, I...
Don't...
Don't be here.
Nobody loves you.
Your mothers regret squeezing you out of their collective birth canals.
They would have eaten you.
They would have eaten you if they had known.
Eat your young.
That's my advice to all of you.
That's Dr. Sinister's advice.
That's me.
Eat your young.
And remember...
To always wash behind your ears.
And if you must die, here's what to do.
Jump in Bob's pipe.
Let him smoke you.
I stole that line from one of the guests.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Thank you very much.
It has been...
A pleasure.
Take three.
Take two.
Take one.
Quiet, please.
Quiet, please.
Recording.
Quiet, please.
We are recording.
Customers are reminded that pickpockets
are permitted anywhere on London Underground.
Uh-oh.
Please keep your pockets at this station.
Customers are underground.
All right.
That's good.
Good.
Very nice.
