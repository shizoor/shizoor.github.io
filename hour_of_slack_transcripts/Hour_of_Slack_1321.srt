1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
This is Phil Proctor and David Osman of the Firesign Theatre, and we're enjoying listening to the Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,700
I'm slacking off myself.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,340
It's all my fault.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,880
It's all my fault that

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,180
X-Day sucks.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,540
It's all my fault that

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,600
It's my fault that Reverend

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,900
Funny name, can't stalk, Reverend Hot Ass.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,000
It's my fault that Reverend Mooch actually had to work his slack barter shift.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,320
It's my fault there are not 17 film festivals all playing machete at the same time.

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,760
It's my fault that

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:00:59,980
It's my fault that

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,220
the best band ever didn't play.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,760
It's my fault that everything cool that's ever happened has been banned.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,720
It's my fault that no one showed up to X-Day, not even you.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,660
You see, it's because I'm always on the rag.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,120
In fact, I never stop bleeding.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,180
And I'm always a bitch because I'm always on the rag,

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,060
because I'm always on the rag because I'm a bitch,

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,980
because I never stop bleeding because I'm always on the rag.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And it's always my fault.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,580
I pulled my bloody woolly vag over Stang's eyes.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,500
I have brainwashed all of you with my bleeding vagina.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,760
Everyone.

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,640
I brainwashed we, I brainwashed Nikki, Susie, Stang, Philo.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,340
I brainwashed all of them.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,980
Because I guess they're just...

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
stupid people who are easily brainwashed.

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,860
Right?

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
They just never noticed that I was brainwashing them.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,500
And it's my fault because I brainwashed everyone.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,620
You guys are completely miserable and this is the worst X-Day ever.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,740
And it's all my fault.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm a master manipulator.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,800
You don't believe me?

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,160
How the hell did I get all of you guys to volunteer?

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,660
Because I brainwashed you with my vagina, duh.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,800
But...

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,960
But...

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,540
But hold on just one second.

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,120
No, wait, wait.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
Hold on one second because I want to think about this.

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,600
Is it possible that this lone vagina, this lone crazy bitch,

45
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,180
could have masterminded such utter changes in the Church of the Subgenius?

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,820
Could I be that powerful?

47
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh, hell no, you fucking idiots.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,820
Do you really think a bimbo like me could pull off this shit?

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm just some dumb twat with tits.

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,440
Do you think I could actually change the dynamic of this group to remove the dead weight

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,020
that has been dragging us down all this time?

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,620
Hell no.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,780
You know, I ain't that pretty, I ain't that smart, and I ain't that evil.

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,020
But I know someone who is.

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,600
There is one person, one man, who is that smart, that pretty,

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,200
that evil, who could pull this off.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Yes, my friends, the evil mastermind is none other than the smartest subgenius,

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,680
Dr. Legume.

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,620
Because you see, boys and girls, Legume brainwashed me into brainwashing you.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,540
He pulled his...

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
woolly nutsack over my eyes.

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,220
Hell, he pulled his woolly nutsack over all of our eyes.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:20,360
So, seekers, if this is the worst X Day ever, blame Legume.

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,520
If your time sucked, it is Legume's fault.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,460
Thank you.

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,800
Thank you.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Thank you.

68
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,920
But...

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Thank you.

70
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,180
Thank you.

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,220
Thank you.

72
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,660
But...

73
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,180
But...

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,180


75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,500
My heart!

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,660
But...

77
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,420
If it rocked, that's Legume's fault too.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in fact, if this is the best X Day ever, if you've had a kick-ass time, I think you

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,440
owe Legume a blowjob.

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,740
And if you can't do that, you at least should give him flowers.

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,540
With your asses, the vase.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,860
And without further ado...

83
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,740
Thank you.

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you.

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,280
Thank you.

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,280


87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,460
Thank you.

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,300
Thank you.

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,300


90
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,300
Thank you.

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,760
Thank you.

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Thank you.

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:04,800


94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:04,800


95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,660
This X Day sucks.

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,980
This is the absolute worst fucking X Day in the history of fucking X Days.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,560
And yes, it's all my fault.

98
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,320
Oh, brothers and sisters, there are times when the butt hurt got deep, and it was...

99
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,300
and it was all I could do to keep Pisces afloat in it.

100
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,040
I wasn't even going to get my feet wet.

101
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,140
But yes, it was an effort.

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,140
I had to brainwash Pisces into doing all this.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,560
Because I'm lazy and I don't want to have to go to each and every one of you

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,720
and give you a personal fucking brainwashing.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,780
There just aren't enough hours in the fucking day for that.

106
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,980
Because some of these people are just fucking nuts.

107
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,380
Yeah, let me tell you, brothers and sisters,

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,420
how many people do you know who are totally fucking nuts?

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,820
It's real easy to slip into the realm of nutdom.

110
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,400
It's very easy to slip into that realm of nutdom, brothers and sisters.

111
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,700
You see, we live...

112
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,620
We live in a prison of lies.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Mad apes crammed into boxes with our civilization dangling precariously

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
from a spider strand of lies.

115
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,460
Our collective belief systems programmed with imaginary monsters

116
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,880
and magic bird men to keep us from going ape shit crazy.

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,180
Let us examine that turn of phrase, ape shit crazy.

118
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,180
It's interesting that when that spider strand of lies,

119
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
snaps inside a person's head,

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
that person goes ape shit crazy,

121
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,140
and it's implied that he's gone insane.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,700
But I put forth this proposition, brothers and sisters.

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,520
An ape who has suddenly had his lies taken from him

124
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,660
goes ape shit sane.

125
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,380
He may appear insane to you,

126
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,400
and probably to himself.

127
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,240
Or,

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,700
there's also this thing called,

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,280
the other swing,

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,340
where everybody else is crazy but them.

131
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,080
And they may appear, like I said,

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,060
because many of you are still dangling from the thread of lies.

133
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,540
And so it seems like it's much more of a tragic butt hurt.

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,780
You learn that there's no magic space daddy.

135
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,700
That those...

136
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,700
He learns that those he loves will either rape him in the ass or die.

137
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,860
He sees himself for the first time as a fragile, rotting ape,

138
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,000
whose every accomplishment will turn to dust and be forgotten.

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,160
As will he himself.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,180
Money, borders, property, gods, magic, all of our convenient fictions fall

141
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,740
before the great thread breaking scythe of big daddy death.

142
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,540
One day, we will all go ape shit.

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,580
In his presence.

144
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,820
Nobody's biography ever has a happy ending.

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,660
But what now, you may ask.

146
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,880
Somebody ask, what now?

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
What now, you have asked, as you may,

148
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,140
because that's what it says in my notes here.

149
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,200
What now, you may ask.

150
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,900
You see that?

151
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,180
I knew this shit was going to happen long before it did.

152
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,820
If I think too much about these lies now,

153
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
I may go prematurely ape shit.

154
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, my friends, that's why I'm here tonight.

155
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm not here to offer you another strand of lies.

156
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,340
No, sir, ma'am.

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm here to offer you a hefty rope of lies.

158
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,700
New and better lies.

159
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
21st century lies.

160
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Oozing with hot sex and armies of killer robots from outer space.

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,600
Designed to ensure you don't go prematurely ape shit sane.

162
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,340
I know that most of you,

163
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,820
are oppressed under the yoke of conspiracy slave masters.

164
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,960
And every day you dream and wish,

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,380
you could just scream, fuck you, and start killing them.

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,640
As well as all of the other pinks

167
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
who hang their steaming buckets of shit on your yoke.

168
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,460
I know that day after day that dream haunts you all

169
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,780
as the yoke gets heavier and heavier.

170
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,400
I know you cry out to the heavens,

171
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,700
will I ever,

172
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,140
have the slack I so crave?

173
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,980
Does the wolf man have a pointy red dick?

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,940
Fuck yes he does,

175
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,940
as you'll see when the saucers arrive to take us to planet X.

176
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,060
In the book of the subgenius it is written,

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,140
the stupider it looks,

178
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,140
the more important it probably is.

179
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,020
Look around you, brothers and sisters.

180
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,240
What could be stupider,

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,700
than a pack of socialists,

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,380
and a bunch of stupidly retarded subgeniuses,

183
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,480
listening to a tattooed fat man,

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,080
screaming that flying saucers,

185
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,200
are going to carry away a secret tribe of sasquatches,

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,640
to an outer space paradise.

187
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,540
In the book of the subgenius it is written,

188
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Bob makes a million dollars,

189
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,640
every time he fucks up.

190
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,620
I don't see any millionaires here,

191
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:55,700


192
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:55,700


193
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:55,700


194
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,200
the fact that he hasn't made a million dollars,

195
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,480
off the church of the subgenius,

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,800
just proves he didn't fuck up.

197
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,260
The end is nigh my yeti kin.

198
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,680
On planet X,

199
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,180
there are sex gods and goddesses,

200
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,140
triple rainbow shitting unicorns,

201
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,200
and big dick leprechauns,

202
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
friendly rape bears with cotton candy chlamydia,

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,380
chocolate dinosaurs,

204
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,140
mermaids and mermen,

205
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,680
made of lice,

206
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,340
living cocaine,

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,020
wolf men with pointy red dicks,

208
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,880
and you can fuck them all,

209
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,760
or kill them for fun.

210
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
Just wait,

211
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,680
just wait until you lay your bugging eyes,

212
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,080
on the valley of awesome titties.

213
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,680
You'll shit a perfectly round turd,

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,580
when you see your personal yacht,

215
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,780
floating in biscuits and gravy lake.

216
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,720
You'll cum a gallon,

217
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,040
on the faces of the suck midgets.

218
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,020
But first,

219
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,140
vengeance is yours.

220
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,260
With every breath,

221
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,400
we shall hunt down our pink enemies.

222
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,960
Each day we will spill their blood,

223
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,940
till it rains down from the skies.

224
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,980
The excess ships are not just pleasure saucers,

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,060
and escape vessels,

226
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,940
they're also an armada of attack ships,

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,940
loaded with the most horrible,

228
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,280
and lethal array of weapons imaginable.

229
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,580
Ion cannons,

230
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,300
killer wasp drones,

231
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
with chainsaw limbs and AIDS darts.

232
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,060
Giant flying robot bears,

233
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,740
with napalm diarrhea,

234
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,800
and electrified rape batons.

235
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,160
Flesh eating missiles,

236
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,940
bad luck bombs.

237
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,220
You'll bust a gut laughing,

238
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,700
as the Westboro Baptist Church,

239
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
gets crop dusted with queer gas.

240
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,360
Yes, all this and more awaits us,

241
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,180
when Bob's promise rings true,

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,000
and when it does,

243
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,900
the very sky will crack open,

244
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,720
and all will nail and gnash their teeth,

245
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,120
because they know the time is coming,

246
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,180
and they will look to the skies,

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,460
and they will see the face of dobs looking back,

248
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,260
and on that day,

249
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,860
they will reap it.

250
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,620
Well, I saw you running along the road in the hot sun today.

251
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
That takes stamina.

252
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,040
Well, I wanted to make sure that I could get first in line

253
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,340
on the saucer's line on July 5th.

254
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,320
It's not going to be a Darwinian struggle

255
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
of people clawing their way on board,

256
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,660
like on a city bus in San Francisco.

257
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,440
We will file on in orderly,

258
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,140
harmonious fashion,

259
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,540
singing hymns,

260
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,800
or at least that's what the manual says.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,380
Well, but then there's the other side.

262
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,320
It's like...

263
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
You thought they'll suddenly put up the ramps

264
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,460
and leave somebody behind?

265
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,360
No, no.

266
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Ten minutes after 7 a.m.,

267
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,340
we'll each of us have these huge battle planet-sized saucers,

268
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,340
and, uh,

269
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,000
equipped with whatever we want to be equipped with,

270
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,660
and we'll be flying around the Earth,

271
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,540
either torturing our old bosses and schoolteachers,

272
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,480
or, in some cases,

273
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,240
collecting collectibles.

274
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,960
I have announced many times

275
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,140
I have dibs on the Grand Canyon,

276
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,960
the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam,

277
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,380
the Museum of Natural History.

278
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,100
I think you've got the Smithsonian

279
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,920
and the plastic dinosaur museum.

280
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,520
I've got the Smithsonian.

281
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:51,780
I've got the Smithsonian,

282
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,740
but the plastic dinosaur warehouse is no longer any good.

283
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,200
They got bought up by somebody.

284
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,380
They don't even have the latest dinosaurs in it anymore.

285
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,540
It's very sad.

286
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,340
Anyway, friends,

287
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,520
what I'm getting to is,

288
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,420
the reason I mention these things that I have dibs on,

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,620
I don't want to end up getting into a fight

290
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,100
with Dr. Legume over who gets Las Vegas.

291
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,140
You know what I'm saying?

292
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean, there's enough room to beam up

293
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,520
literally anything you want,

294
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,360
I suppose you could beam up the whole Earth,

295
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,600
but then all the other subgeniuses would gang up on you.

296
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
That's too greedy.

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,300
I mean, it's not going to change our essential nature.

298
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,960
Beaming up the whole Earth could be done,

299
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,860
but it's greedy.

300
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,580
It's like using the last of your three wishes

301
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,440
to wish for three more wishes.

302
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
You may think you're being clever,

303
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,560
but you're just going to get yourself in deeper.

304
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,900
There's plenty for you to take from the planet,

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,740
and it's all for the taking.

306
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,480
But let's show some proportion.

307
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,780
The only contraband is that...

308
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,820
Anyone who was planning to stick around for Starwood,

309
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
I've already taken care of that.

310
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,240
I will, Princess Wee and I,

311
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,300
will beam all of Wisteria and its staff,

312
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,600
whether saved or unsaved,

313
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,960
and all the pagans who paid to go to Starwood,

314
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,920
onto my planet.

315
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,860
They'll feel...

316
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,520
Well, we'll need waiters and busboys and...

317
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:14,800
...just disabled, so get what they paid for.

318
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,960
Those who are subgeniuses

319
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,720
will continue to live on after Starwood.

320
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,200
Starwood is over.

321
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,440
And those who still refuse to buy that $30 membership pack

322
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
will simply be ejected into space

323
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,100
or put back in the crater that this place once was.

324
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,260
We also will be lifting up the land of Brushwood,

325
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,900
but not the staff.

326
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,320
Yes.

327
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,020
And so they will be left in the crater

328
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,420
with the robo-beasts

329
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,860
and the seven-dicked bears that...

330
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,660
So, for speaking of...

331
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
The man-bear-pig.

332
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,640
Man-bear-pigs and herding butts,

333
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,200
what would a doctor like you normally...

334
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,060
He might be taking a siesta,

335
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,620
which is a very civilized institution that we recommend.

336
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,980
The Mexicans have it right.

337
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,720
There's nothing better than taking a nap at midday

338
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,040
for tip-top good health and all-around awareness.

339
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,320
Not just Mexico.

340
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,420
Most people in Mexico...

341
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,280
And the better countries in Europe.

342
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,880
In Europe, yeah.

343
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,880
Everywhere but here,

344
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,460
where they want you to bustle around

345
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,400
and break your back in hot heat, you know,

346
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,180
for the conspiracy.

347
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,800
I remember a day right here in the United States.

348
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,200
Now, this may seem like science fiction to many of you,

349
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,500
but there was a time when it was normal

350
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,940
to smoke cigarettes at work,

351
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,800
go out at lunch and have two or three beers

352
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,700
and come back to work and smoke and cuss.

353
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,380
And it was expensive.

354
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,040
And tell sexist jokes

355
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,160
and hang up Playboy calendars or whatnot in your office

356
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,060
without fear of being sued for sexual harassment.

357
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,260
And chew and spit and scratch

358
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,200
with nobody telling you otherwise.

359
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,740
Yeah.

360
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,040
Now, somehow or another,

361
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,680
this 1984-type cross between 1984 and Brave New World

362
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,220
that's come to pass seems normal to us.

363
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,940
I remember reading a science fiction book

364
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,420
called Stand on Zanzibar, written in the late 60s,

365
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,180
that I thought at the time, it's like,

366
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,660
this is pretty realistic,

367
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,280
but I don't think I could live in a world like this.

368
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,720
It was about mass overpopulation.

369
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,460
Yeah. Well, it's today's headlines.

370
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,520
It's not even science fiction anymore.

371
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,580
You see, people used to be down...

372
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,220
It's like that movie Idiocracy.

373
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,100
That was... It's already outdated.

374
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,980
All My Balls is the hit show.

375
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,520
And in fact, if anything,

376
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,780
Mike Judge, who wrote that,

377
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,960
that was disgustingly optimistic.

378
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,980
And that's our greatest fear.

379
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,040
It's that in our immense subgenius pessimism,

380
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,540
we're actually still being idiotically optimistic.

381
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,480
Well, I don't understand anything you say in Reverend Stang.

382
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,980
It just sounds like a bunch of faggy talk, eh?

383
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,580
Are you sure? You ain't faggots, are you?

384
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,020
Yeah.

385
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,300
You're funny.

386
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,040
Dr. Howell has not seen Idiocracy.

387
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,640
No, I look forward to it.

388
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,980
He has lived it without...

389
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,820
Oh, he's still alive, but...

390
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,040
Well, I did read the book you mentioned,

391
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,380
Stand on Zanzibar, by John Brunner,

392
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,400
and the other book you wrote about

393
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,060
horrible ecological catastrophe and pollution,

394
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,420
which is called The Sheep Look Up.

395
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,800
Right.

396
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,480
And, you know, it's important to read these books,

397
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,060
but the authorities, particularly conspiracy academic authorities,

398
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,820
will say, oh, this stuff is trash, this isn't real literature.

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,680
It's escape literature,

400
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,140
as if it's a good thing to escape before it's time

401
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,840
into ecological catastrophe, overpopulation,

402
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,320
into everything that people would rather escape from.

403
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,900
Rather than escape, it's a matter of being mentally fit

404
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,700
and preparing yourself for these terrifying eventualities

405
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,880
when they do come true, as they will, and are doing right now.

406
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,040
There really are monsters out there.

407
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,000
Quite a few.

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,280
They look just like you and me.

409
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,020
Diabolos incarnatus est.

410
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,380
Some of the most vicious ones are handsome, handsome fellows.

411
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh, you've got to watch out for them the most, those pretty boys.

412
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,960
Ted Bundy, the serial killer, is a charmer.

413
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,940
Yeah, cholerads come to life.

414
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,740
And who is the most smoothly cosmetic...

415
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
...conster out there?

416
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,440
I guess it's a certain Mr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

417
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,920
He's our monster.

418
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,420
Our holy monster.

419
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,660
He can kill more pinks than any of them other monster hunters can.

420
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,400
This is not a figure of speech.

421
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,660
Dobbs is a monster.

422
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,320
We are monster fans, and Dobbs is our best monster.

423
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,740
Our greatest monster.

424
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,060
And yet they would want to put him in prison if they can get their hands on him.

425
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,860
This is why J.R. is so elusive.

426
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,160
The conspiracy's been trying to track him down for years.

427
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,620
Well, that's that problem with the IRS, all that legal crap.

428
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,900
I don't go into it.

429
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll go into it myself.

430
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
But yeah, they'd love to talk to Dobbs.

431
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,040
They'd love to get him out.

432
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,700
Well, that's why we have that clever robot there.

433
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,920
Yeah, there he is.

434
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,740
Right there.

435
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Yeah, there.

436
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,280
If you want to catch...

437
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,040
See, don't bother hunting down J.R. Bob Dobbs.

438
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,460
There he is.

439
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,080
He's already dead.

440
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,600
We killed him.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,240
Right.

442
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,660
Yep.

443
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,600
Nothing to worry about.

444
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,840
Nothing to see here.

445
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,420
Move along.

446
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,760
The real Bob would be here today if he could.

447
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,460
But we know that somewhere out there amongst even you, the faithful, there is at least

448
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,960
one conspiracy dupe.

449
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,560
We'll know who that individual is when the saucers arrive.

450
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,900
It's like the fastest guy in the world.

451
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:39,900


452
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,920
There's a master gunfighter in town.

453
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,200
There's some twerp who's going to have to try him and see if he can gun him down.

454
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,860
And that guy may be so maladroit, so clumsy and stupid that the finely trained reflexes

455
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,520
of the master gunfighter are helpless against this boob.

456
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,080
And that's how you lose your Wild Bill Hickok and Jesse James.

457
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,900
Yeah, I was going to say Wild Bill Hickok was the perfect example.

458
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,780
An amateur is the one who's going to get you, not the highly trained professional you go

459
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,240
up against.

460
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,220
It's not Michael Alcindor or Doc Martian or Bob Dean that I'm worried about.

461
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,560
It's the ones who never, we never hear from.

462
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,380
Not the ones who leave 40 messages on my answer machine in a row in 10 minutes.

463
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,760
It's the ones that we don't know.

464
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,140
The ones that never said a word.

465
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,880
That one Bobby who walked in.

466
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,100
That's why I'm wearing this bulletproof shirt.

467
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
The Judas of the Church of the Subgenius.

468
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,220
The Judas of the Subgenius.

469
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,960
The Judas of the Church of the Subgenius.

470
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,060
The Judas of the Church of the Subgenius.

471
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,060


472
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,060


473
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,060


474
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,600
That's why sometimes the person we have to worry about the most is not the conspiracy,

475
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,960
but the Bobby who punches J.R. Bob Dobb in the abdomen just before his last Halloween

476
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,320
performance.

477
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,240
It could be, you know, you have to be vigilant.

478
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,420
And eternal vigilance is the price of slack.

479
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,420
What?

480
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,560
I thought it was the other way around.

481
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,520
What?

482
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,400
That would be...

483
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,000
Slack was what saved you from having to have eternal vigilance.

484
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,800
Yeah, but you have to get it first by being eternally vigilant.

485
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,680
In which case, eternal vigilance is your slack.

486
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
That's the yin to the yang.

487
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,460
Speaking of which, here comes my fellow emergentile, Pisces.

488
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:31,360
There aren't many of us, and you, the you Rewardians, should be lucky that we only take one out of ten of you.

489
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Well, whether you be Rewardian or an Ivan Jellicoe, we have more...

490
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,720
Emergentile.

491
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
Or an emergentile.

492
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,360
We have more in common than we do in opposition.

493
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,960
It's pointless to be, you know...

494
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,180
Right.

495
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,880
I mean, the evangelicals and the holocaustals may argue on certain points whether the humans

496
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,780
should all be killed completely or kept alive as slaves, or how they're treated as slaves.

497
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,260
I mean, it's up to you.

498
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,020
If you want to...

499
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,500
Just don't kill my slaves, okay?

500
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,060
Holocaustals...

501
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,140
Kill your own slaves.

502
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,060
We'll have neutral slaves.

503
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,060


504
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,940
And free states and free states.

505
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,160
An Ivan Jellicoe is just as capable of killing mass millions as a holocaustal.

506
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,760
It's just that he'd rather use them as sex toys.

507
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,760
Speaking of slaves and sex toys and everything else, I notice there's about a lot of people here

508
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,740
who may not have a certain green wristband on.

509
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,160
Oh, yes.

510
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,260
For the record, that will be closing in 30 minutes.

511
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,140
Registration will be closing soon, and you don't want to end up being locked in those...

512
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,660
Those sweat lodges we call porter clean.

513
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,200
Right.

514
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
Or even worse, the...

515
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,960
They all say porter clean on those sweat lodges, and we can lock you in there.

516
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,140
There are penalties too terrible.

517
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:56,640
If you do not have a green wristband on your arm, then you should probably speak to Reverend

518
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,880
Scum and Reverend Felix Automaton over there, who is holding up the sign.

519
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,120
Also, while you're over there getting your wristband, you may want to say something.

520
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,020
I'm going to sit down and say hello to Reverend Organbeard and peruse the fine wares available.

521
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,600
That's right.

522
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
At the swag table.

523
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,020
At the swag table.

524
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,980
Friends, even if you're planning to spend all your money on beer and prostitutes this

525
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,700
weekend, at least take a good look at that stuff, because it's all available online.

526
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,140
And at least get your greed gland going.

527
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,020
Look at it and go, I'm going to spend my money on beer instead.

528
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
But someday, when I'm rich, I can...

529
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,520
You could always go to subgenius.com and buy that cool t-shirt.

530
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,180
Yeah, if you're troubled with conspiracy impulses that I ought to be buying something,

531
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,260
well, we've got stuff.

532
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,560
You can get rid of that by buying things here.

533
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,660
We don't sell that stuff for the Subgenius Corporation.

534
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,500
We sell that for you, because we're actually trying to liberate that money from what you

535
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,840
might have otherwise spent it on.

536
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,220
It may have been the drugs that gave you the bad trip.

537
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
It may have been the food that gave you the heart attack.

538
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,680
It may have been the prostitute that gave you the crabs.

539
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,200
You don't know, but what you do know is if you don't first spend it on Bob, you're going

540
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,500
to spend it on something you regret.

541
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,680
I know I'm among friends here, and so I'll be a little bit confessional.

542
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:22,400
I've been spending all my time reading books and writing things with ink on paper and drawing,

543
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,380
but every now and then I get a disturbing feeling, like when I was on the road and I

544
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,900
went into this convenience store, and there were blister packs all over the store with

545
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,460
little devices in them.

546
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,800
I had no idea what any of them were for.

547
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,920
They're components that add into something else, but what are they?

548
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,940
I have to confess, this has completely passed me by.

549
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,580
And furthermore, since they're in the equivalent of a 7-Eleven, they have to be crapola versions

550
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,560
of whatever they really are.

551
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,820
But what could they be?

552
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,140
And why don't I have one, or several?

553
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,380
Dr. Howell, there's this amazing new electric gizmo called the MP3 player.

554
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,660
Yeah.

555
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,260
It's a...

556
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,800
It plays the MC5 or something.

557
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Dr. The Walkman, you know, the little cassette recorder?

558
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,140
Yeah, I used to have one.

559
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,840
I still do.

560
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,700
I just don't have the...

561
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,640
Dr. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

562
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,180
Nothing to put on except our slack.

563
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,420
Dr. It's so that people who have to constantly have something blotting out their

564
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,280
thoughts and anxieties and fears and creativity...

565
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,360
The distraction box.

566
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,680
Dr. ...will always have someone else's testosterone and thoughts replacing their

567
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,040
own.

568
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,900
They need the helmet.

569
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,540
Dr. I hate to say...

570
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,280
I know that there's probably some real Howard Stern fans here, but to me, those are people

571
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,280
who let Howard Stern wear their balls.

572
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,500
And no offense.

573
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,080
Since I'm a radio personality myself, I don't...

574
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,760
I don't...

575
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,780
I can kind of get out of that.

576
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Dr. I used to love listening to Howard Stern when I was driving my kids to school.

577
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,060
Every, you know, one minute out of the...

578
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,140
I'm sure it helped prepare them for school, too.

579
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,520
Dr. But it's when you make some conspiracy theory...

580
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,340
Or even a rogue subgenius, like Howard Stern, who knows of Bob.

581
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,760
In fact, his Reverend District Attorney, Abinath, he worked with him.

582
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,740
I was going to be on Stern's show when I was in New York once, but it happened to be

583
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,780
the day some guy was going to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and insisted on Howard Stern

584
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,000
talking him out of it.

585
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,920
And so, Stern talked the idiot out of jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, instead of exposing

586
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
the world to the church of the subgenius.

587
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,920
looking back on it

588
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,900
I am certain that that was Bob's will

589
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,420
because the one thing that could kill

590
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,040
the Church of the Subgenius

591
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,880
is for it to become popular

592
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,280
by definition that would be the end of it

593
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,420
sure a few of us might make enough money to retire on

594
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,240
but then we'd be hated and despised

595
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,280
and the Simpsons would make fun of us

596
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,840
instead of making homage to us

597
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,900
you know what I mean?

598
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,060
I mean the minute that every pink in the world

599
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,260
is running around saying praise Bob

600
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,360
what does that make the rest of us look like?

601
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,100
there's just no point in it

602
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,200
we exist because of the conspiracy

603
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,980
I think you guys need to start this thing off

604
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,020
they started it

605
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,180
synthesis, antithesis

606
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,580
and then it's put together

607
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,600
you should be prepared for this friends

608
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,360
you're going to see a lot more of this in the future

609
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,880
the false prophets in the Church of the Subgenius

610
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,560
the people who are trying to start

611
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,340
their own ecstasy

612
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,220
without the proper subgenius TM in the corner

613
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,300
or whatever other version of events

614
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
they'll try to take just enough of the subgeniusness

615
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,340
pervert it just enough

616
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,580
so it doesn't really give you the slack

617
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,160
it takes your slack

618
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,960
but to make it conspiracy friendly

619
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,140
oh yeah if you go over to Brushwood right now

620
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,260
they're having a praise bill UFO death cult festival

621
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,880
that's how it'll be done friends

622
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,420
the beginning of the end times

623
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,200
they can just

624
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,700
feel it

625
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,040
the end is coming

626
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,720
and the last gasps of desperation

627
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,160
and the most frightening aspect is it could work

628
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,460
it's worked in so many other instances

629
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,640
they were able to do it with Elvis

630
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,940
they were able to do it with Christianity

631
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,480
and split it into all of its warring factions

632
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,740
and even include mutations like Mormonism

633
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,480
actually Mormonism and subgenius

634
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,180
have some slight differences between them and the rest of the world

635
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,620
in some ways

636
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,200
there's a great take on the AA

637
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
some background music

638
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,180
everyone just loves seeing WE

639
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,700
could do all the cats and dogs

640
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:45,700


641
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:45,700


642
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:45,700


643
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:45,880
they can play any of those music

644
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:45,880


645
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,800
as long as it brings animated instruments

646
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:46,960
than you guys can cruising everywhere

647
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,820
all these different songs

648
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


649
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


650
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


651
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


652
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


653
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,820


654
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,580
you can't buy or wear

655
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,120
you can't buy anything

656
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,300
just do the example

657
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,480
just be yourself

658
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,240
just be yourself

659
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,960
and God help you

660
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,940
right now

661
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,540
But see, what they'll do is they'll take some of the more popular aspects of the church to subgenius,

662
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,340
and they'll encapsulate it in this new religion,

663
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,960
and then they'll mix it in with something that we find absolutely abhorrent.

664
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,120
The Rosicrucians and the Masons were the worst.

665
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,120
They ripped us off.

666
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,480
They've been ripping us off for 500 years.

667
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,600
Well, you don't want them to make subgenius into an app.

668
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,220
No, they want to turn it into that treatment that they use in the Clockwork Orange

669
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,240
where you're strapped down with your eyes and it's cold.

670
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,420
It's bad enough.

671
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,520
It's mostly radio shows now instead of books.

672
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,320
I personally prefer the written word.

673
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,200
I've watched only two television shows in the last 10 years.

674
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,000
Well, they won't be content until the moment...

675
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
But I did watch every episode.

676
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,360
No one has said that the moment we hear the theme song to the Hour of Slack,

677
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,880
we begin to vomit on ourselves.

678
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,300
What is the theme song?

679
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,940
There's a hundred theme songs to the Hour of Slack.

680
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,240
Is it the same as the theme to the new...

681
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,720
Three Stooges cartoon show?

682
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,380
No, it's the same as the theme to the Benny Hill show.

683
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,280
But what was that...

684
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,100
No, I'm buying that for a dollar.

685
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,760
What was that...

686
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,360
Gackety Sacks, you mean?

687
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,720
What was the one you were mentioning the other night?

688
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,620
The guy...

689
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,560
The kid show host who had the Three Stooges and the...

690
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,540
Oh, Slam Bang Theater.

691
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,860
Slam Bang Theater.

692
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,060
Well, yeah, but that was a local Fort Worth kid show host.

693
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,240
I doubt there's anyone here that remembers Slam Bang Theater from Channel 11.

694
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,100
I mean, Fort Worth.

695
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,440
You see, it contained within itself the nucleus of divine wisdom.

696
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,800
And from henceforth, that will be the theme song to the Hour of Slack.

697
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,000
If Philo and Doc Frock were here, we could all sing the theme of Slam Bang Theater

698
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,240
and its host, Icky Twerp.

699
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,580
Icky Twerp, a famous prototypical subgenius.

700
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,340
Well, the real theme song to the subgenius Hour of Slack

701
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,100
has to be played in a subliminal wavelength

702
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,040
so that it can't be ripped off and commercialized by the conspiracy.

703
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,060
You know it when you hear it because you know it's the real Hour of Slack.

704
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,460
And it goes without saying.

705
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,920
We never...

706
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,060
We didn't know until just a couple of days ago

707
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,100
that Papa Joe Mama was going to be here.

708
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,340
I've heard that Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is on his way.

709
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,300
At the same time, we lost...

710
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,080
Several of our folks that we expected,

711
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,300
you know, that are almost always here at X-Day

712
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,080
because someone was dying or someone just died.

713
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,540
Or someone's dog was about to die.

714
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,580
He slings an arrow.

715
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,060
I have news for you, friends.

716
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,240
Everything is about to die.

717
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
Yes, it's true.

718
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,400
Except for us.

719
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,440
And even then, we will die to our old lives.

720
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,780
It would look to others as if we had died.

721
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,940
But we'll know different.

722
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,900
They think of it as death.

723
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,160
But it's not like the Heaven's Gate thing or Jones.

724
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,780
No, we allow you to take more luggage

725
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,280
and you don't have to pay a fee.

726
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,640
Did anybody remember the Kool-Aid?

727
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,860
It's supposed to be...

728
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,560
I've got some.

729
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,620
It's Flavor Aid, classically.

730
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:13,940
Right.

731
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,280
I really don't want to take responsibility for the Kool-Aid.

732
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,500
I'm doing enough at 7 in the morning.

733
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,700
We need a couple of nurses to mix up a big galvanized tub of it.

734
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
It's a slave minion.

735
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,140
And help her slap barter people.

736
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,140
Also, we need the paper cups with the Dobbs head on it to drink it out of.

737
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,520
Yeah, we just need little paper cups.

738
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,420
And make sure that you have...

739
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I don't have my Dobbs head rubber stamp, but...

740
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,100
Well, that's making it hard, isn't it?

741
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,800
Are some myrmidon going to spend time drawing a little Dobbs head on each paper cup?

742
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,660
Yeah, the idea is at 7 a.m., for those of you who have not been to the 7 a.m. drills,

743
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,800
at 7 o'clock, just before 7 o'clock...

744
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,140
We give you a delicious, refreshing beverage.

745
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm using my watch.

746
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,500
As the perfect time.

747
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,260
We do a countdown.

748
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,780
10 seconds, you know, 10, 9, 8, 7.

749
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,540
At zero, we all shout together,

750
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,900
the only law of the Church of the Subgenius,

751
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,060
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

752
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,700
Down the Kool-Aid,

753
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
and all scream and holler and await the saucers.

754
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,580
Yeah, as you jump up and down, it mixes the Kool-Aid inside you.

755
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,460
Now, in fact, my friends, I'll admit to you that

756
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,280
after all the previews,

757
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:41,580
I usually find about 25 or 30 untouched cups hidden under chairs and so forth.

758
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,500
They just...

759
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,340
Come all the way out there and they don't drink it.

760
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,640
Well, they think we're going to spike it with LSD

761
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,280
or we're going to poison them so that we can make the news,

762
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,980
which does work.

763
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,120
When that horrible child custody case happened in 2006 and 2007,

764
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,500
my business doubled.

765
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:00,880
Mm-hmm.

766
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,100
So...

767
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,080
And I've gotten my eye out for another child custody...

768
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Any parents that I can report...

769
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,320
We could do that if we wanted to.

770
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,020
For instance, Dr. Drummond has that sweet little girl, Lily.

771
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,900
She may appear to be sweet.

772
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,140
He's got some, you know...

773
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,040
He could get us some...

774
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,480
She's got a sting to her.

775
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,340
Someone please...

776
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,160
Lily is no...

777
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,600
He's on that famous show in San Francisco, Puzzling Evidence.

778
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,360
That's been on the air since 1982.

779
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
We've been on the air for 26 years.

780
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,120
It's in Berkeley, actually.

781
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,280
Not San Francisco.

782
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,460
My show is in San Francisco.

783
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,580
The Ask Dr. Hal show on RadioValencia.com.

784
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,980
The Puzzling Evidence radio show on KPFA 94.1 FM

785
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,920
is and always will be in Berkeley.

786
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Ironically enough.

787
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,060
That was the first subgenius radio show, Puzzling Evidence,

788
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,040
started in 1982.

789
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,100
Hour of Slack was on a much smaller station

790
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,980
but was syndicated to other stations.

791
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,260
That started in 1982.

792
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,180
The show was on a much smaller station

793
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


794
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


795
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


796
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


797
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


798
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


799
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180


800
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,500
You can download all but the first 200.

801
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,500
You can download all but the first 200.

802
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,240
So that leaves 1,100 episodes that you can still hear.

803
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,340
Well, I'm sure this audience isn't interested

804
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,480
in the blithery wheezings of superannuated old teasers.

805
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,720
No, I was getting to a point.

806
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,980
There aren't that many shows.

807
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,200
There's Suzy the Floozy's show.

808
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,520
Yes.

809
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,080
And the newest one, The Ministry of Slack.

810
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,360
Where's that come out of?

811
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,260
We're here just a second.

812
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,300
and probably got bored.

813
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,340
They missed their plagola.

814
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
The Ministry of Slack,

815
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,440
I believe, they'll be doing

816
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,380
one of these things up here

817
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,280
in a couple of evenings.

818
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,400
And I get to sit

819
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,060
in the audience and watch.

820
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,280
I wonder what that's like.

821
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,580
That'll be nice.

822
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,040
I think that KPFA, our

823
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,140
show has been cancelled more times

824
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
than any other subgenius show and yet it keeps

825
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,120
coming back. Our show, Buzzing Evidence,

826
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,140
that show, it's been cancelled.

827
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,200
Well, it's been moved and they keep

828
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,880
going after it but they can't keep it down.

829
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,400
This is how you know.

830
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,080
Here's the funny thing about the hour of Slack.

831
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,240
For some

832
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,640
reason in whatever town

833
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,240
it's in, it's usually on a station

834
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,260
with the frequency 89.3

835
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,280
FM.

836
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
In Dallas, it was on every

837
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,920
Sunday night for nine years

838
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,640
at 9 o'clock at 89.3

839
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,160
FM. In Cleveland,

840
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,220
it's been on the air for 20 years

841
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,240
at 9 o'clock every Sunday night.

842
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,100
At an 89.3 FM.

843
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,220
But wasn't there an

844
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,200
interval when the goo-goos got

845
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,340
a hold of it? They tried to make it politically

846
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,380
correct and tried to shut you down?

847
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,140
Oh, they did. We were

848
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,220
shut down in Dallas but luckily by

849
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
then I had already syndicated

850
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,280
it to, for instance,

851
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,020
WREK in Atlanta where

852
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,920
Susie was doing her show. The Society

853
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,120
for Minding Everybody Else's

854
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,180
Business and Knowing Better for You

855
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Than You Do did close

856
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,240
down the original hour of Slack.

857
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,780
for a while but of course you

858
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,460
slice off one of the Hydra's

859
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,940
heads and two more grow

860
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,180
on the stump. Actually it was the Nation

861
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,080
of Islam that temporarily

862
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,400
shut it down.

863
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,020
But yes, exactly.

864
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,280
You cut off one. That just makes us all the

865
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,020
more determined. When I

866
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,160
lost the ability to go into that

867
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,220
Dallas station and do that show, what

868
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,200
did I do? I bought this

869
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,100
and this and

870
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,180
that and started making

871
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,060
I'd put them out on cassette tapes.

872
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,140
And it's like the harder you

873
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,820
try to stop a subgenius,

874
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,300
the more determined that subgenius

875
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,180
will become. And we should appreciate that.

876
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,220
We are motivated by

877
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,100
our enemies and our hate.

878
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,800
The more they attack us. We exist, again,

879
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,120
it can't be said enough. We exist because of the

880
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,060
conspiracy. What we should hate is when they

881
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,820
tolerate us and smugly

882
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,560
shake their heads. Oh, those subgeniuses.

883
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,080
Let them have their fun. No, that's

884
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,140
when we're not having an effect. We need them

885
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,100
to hate us, to be on the offensive,

886
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,920
to be trying to shut us down, to be

887
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,700
hunting us down, to be passing their laws,

888
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,880
to be attacking us constantly. That's when we

889
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,900
know we're making headway. In this

890
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
as in anything, hatred is

891
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,660
not as bad as indifference.

892
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,860
Right. If you really,

893
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,700
really want to piss off an enemy,

894
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,100
ignore them.

895
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,900
Praise Bob. They hate that

896
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,300
worse than anything.

897
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,920
Pay them no attention.

898
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,320
I know this

899
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,860
from 30 years of having

900
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
bitter enemies. It's the worst thing

901
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,600
in love as in hate.

902
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,380
So if at 6.45

903
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,580
a.m. on July 5th, the

904
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,680
black vans filled with SWAT teams

905
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,800
come pouring in. You don't have to get into the technical

906
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,680
The doors kick open

907
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,500
and the men come filing out with their

908
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,600
M16s. Do not

909
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,440
scream. Do not holler. Do not

910
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,740
throw up any resistance. Throw up

911
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,680
your hands and rejoice. It shows we've

912
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,720
finally reached that utopia

913
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,820
we've been reaching for. They know we're on the very

914
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,600
cusp of the liberation

915
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,400
forces coming from on high.

916
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,860
Yeah, when they put us in concentration camps,

917
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,160
then we'll know the church of the subgeniuses

918
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,020
on the map. Then, and only

919
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,080
then. As we said before,

920
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,840
actually, they'll be in the camps.

921
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,720
They'll think we're in them. They're looking

922
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,560
through the wire at us, but

923
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,780
actually, that look goes two

924
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,800
ways. Right. The church is

925
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,780
really like the floating crap game

926
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,820
of religions. They never

927
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,920
talk about what their policies are

928
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,840
when helicopters come into the prison yards.

929
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,700
You know, theoretically, they will

930
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,720
shoot anybody who tries to escape, but

931
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,680
realistically, for liability reasons,

932
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,880
they can't shoot a helicopter if it lands in a prison

933
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
yard. I mean, the pilot may be forced to

934
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,680
be there. His child may have been abducted.

935
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,880
What they don't even have plans for,

936
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,800
though, is when the saucers come and

937
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,100
land in the prison yards.

938
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,940
It's just, they don't even, conceptually,

939
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,800
they haven't even toyed with that idea.

940
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,840
They don't even know where to start with that. We know what

941
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,780
we're going to do when those saucers land, but they

942
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,980
don't know what they're going to do when those saucers land.

943
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,020
So it's the perfect

944
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,720
plan. It's the one that doesn't even need to be

945
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,900
articulated. I know what I'm going to

946
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,040
do. I'm going to point my

947
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,780
laser gun at Legume's saucer

948
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,040
and, you know,

949
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,860
try to outgun him, because I know

950
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,940
he's coming for me. Just make sure

951
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,880
the lasers don't hit their eyes. I just

952
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,900
know it. It's just, I just, you know,

953
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean, he's my friend. We've been

954
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,080
friends for 15, 20 years.

955
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,880
Except for that year. That's why I know him

956
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,860
that well, you know.

957
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,580
He said, as he himself will say,

958
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,820
you knew I was a snake when you

959
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,660
picked me up.

960
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,460
Well, where is Dr. Legume, anyway?

961
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,560
Taking it as he had his

962
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,720
shot. Well, let's not forget that one

963
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,220
moment. Proving he's more of a subgenius

964
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,780
than we are. Let's not forget

965
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,320
the time when Dr. Legume died.

966
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,760
Oh, which one?

967
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,520
He died many times.

968
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,000
In the funeral, the subgenius funeral.

969
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,760
Sure, sure. He kept everyone

970
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,980
in the dark. I watched him

971
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,260
emerge from his coffin.

972
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,700
Right after I said,

973
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,420
if there was really a Bob Dobbs,

974
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,700
like him, he'd still be alive.

975
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,980
By God, there he was. But I think I covered

976
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,740
that last night. He came crawling

977
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,900
back from the...

978
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,120
Maybe he was dead.

979
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,080
He really did die

980
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,140
a couple years ago.

981
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,880
He died on the operating table.

982
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,280
After he came out of it,

983
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,060
he said, well, hell, it's all

984
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,920
uphill from here.

985
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,180
He's been the most productive subgenius

986
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,360
of all of us ever since then.

987
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,020
When Jesus died, they said that

988
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,120
500 people witnessed him

989
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,040
and that was proof that the miracle was real.

990
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,120
Legume's been seen

991
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,160
by 500 people, plus he's been heard by

992
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,760
thousands.

993
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,960
And the hour of slacks

994
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,500
is his day. What does that prove?

995
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,700
Will the conspiracy admit they goofed?

996
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,880
How many of you boys and girls

997
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,780
met your Yeti mate at X Day?

998
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,320
If you met your Yeti mate at X Day,

999
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,440
can I get a hell yeah?

1000
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,080
How many of you have noticed

1001
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,460
there's something a little bit different

1002
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,300
about that sex?

1003
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,880
I met my true Yeti mate

1004
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:00,900
at X Day.

1005
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,120
I met him at the same place that X Day was held.

1006
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,520
Before it was held here.

1007
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,120
Might as well have been here.

1008
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,920
Have you noticed that

1009
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
subgenius sex seems to just

1010
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,840
feel right?

1011
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,080
Unfortunately, I was married to somebody else

1012
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,880
that year, but

1013
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,560
I did meet my true Yeti mate

1014
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,880
at X Day.

1015
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,540
So let's see if we can make up a song

1016
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,820
about

1017
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,100
our true Yeti mate.

1018
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:29,420
Yes.

1019
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,040
I can't hear anything you say, so don't...

1020
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,020
.

1021
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,660
When I saw you

1022
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,440
With that8 dobshead

1023
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,900
on your+,

1024
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,080
on your shirt

1025
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,400
It made me wanna give you

1026
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,860
such good sex hurt

1027
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,140
You're my love

1028
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,900
and I'm your Connie

1029
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,440
Tell me how you wanna slack off, honey

1030
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,940
Let me give you some of that

1031
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,020
Getty sex hurt

1032
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,620
Maybe I'll squirt

1033
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,240
I love how slack gives you

1034
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,760
that little rise

1035
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,680
But it feels like a big one when you

1036
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,560
slide between my thighs

1037
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,300
There's something special about

1038
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,860
Getty love

1039
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,860
Like it came from the saucers

1040
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,580
straight above

1041
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,500
I wanna give you some of that

1042
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,880
Yet he's sick's hurt

1043
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,220
Yet he's sick's hurt

1044
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,940
And maybe I'll squirt

1045
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,840
Music

1046
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:11,940
Music

1047
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,520
Music

1048
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,500
Music

1049
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,380
Music

1050
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,640
Music

1051
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,340
Friends, I have a sad story to tell.

1052
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,980
And it's a true story.

1053
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,340
Last X-Day, this young man that I had never met before

1054
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,700
came up to me and said,

1055
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:44,220
Reverend Stang, I wish I had a preacher

1056
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,000
with more credentials than you to go to,

1057
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,160
but honestly, I don't know who else to talk to about this.

1058
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,020
He goes, I'm 20 years old and I've never been laid.

1059
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,820
And I said, quite honestly,

1060
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,100
I said, you know, that's kind of strange

1061
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,520
because you're tall and skinny,

1062
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,000
which usually is about all that's required.

1063
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,280
But on top of that, he was a perfectly good-looking guy.

1064
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,020
But yet, he had never gotten laid.

1065
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,860
And I said, well, now, don't feel too bad, man.

1066
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,740
I was a teenager in the summer of love.

1067
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,640
I was in my late 70s.

1068
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:25,640


1069
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,020
and everybody I went to high school with,

1070
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,040
including the Dwarf, was getting laid.

1071
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,820
And I could not get a girl to hold hands with me.

1072
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:41,240
Now, I later found out at class reunions 20 years later,

1073
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,820
oh my God, I had a huge crush on you, Stang.

1074
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,120
They didn't call me that then.

1075
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:47,860
They called me Ivan.

1076
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,380
And they...

1077
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,360
They go...

1078
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,440
And I would have fucked you in a minute

1079
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,880
or at least given you a hand job.

1080
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,860
I wasn't at fucking stage yet at age 16.

1081
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,900
But, that was the old days.

1082
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,260
But you were clueless.

1083
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,760
And they said, also, you had this shell around you

1084
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,940
that it was like, I was afraid to get close to you

1085
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,620
because you were like too cool or cold or hard or something.

1086
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,920
And of course, it was just the opposite.

1087
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,320
I was like a little cream puff inside.

1088
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,980
I was sensitive, the sad, lonely little fella.

1089
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,120
But I was trying so hard to act cool

1090
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,920
that I couldn't get laid.

1091
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,220
And I explained that to that young man.

1092
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,380
I said, to tell the truth, girls...

1093
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,460
This probably holds true both ways

1094
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,560
and for all sorts of weird desires.

1095
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,600
They can tell if you have...

1096
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:49,600


1097
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:49,600


1098
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,660
If you have that giant D for desperation on your forehead.

1099
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,000
And it's a vicious circle.

1100
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,320
It's like, well, I can't get rid of the D on my forehead,

1101
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,640
the desperation D, until I get laid.

1102
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,600
And I can't get laid until I get rid

1103
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,140
of the desperation thing.

1104
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,320
In my case, when I was 18,

1105
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,760
I was lucky enough to have a pity fuck.

1106
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,460
Although, in retrospect, it was just the worst thing.

1107
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,220
It probably ever could have happened to you.

1108
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,780
But, you know, all I'm saying is I know.

1109
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,640
I'm in the spirit, my friend.

1110
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,960
You listening to the radio, I can see out there,

1111
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,980
there's a young man who can't believe that he hadn't been laid.

1112
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,020
He thinks he must be like Mr. Hyde.

1113
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,100
He thinks there must be some deformed, horrible thing about him.

1114
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,960
And there is.

1115
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,560
You're slightly different.

1116
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,560
And all I can say is have patience.

1117
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,920
You're not Mr. Hyde.

1118
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,460
You might actually even be pretty ugly and stumpy.

1119
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,920
But that doesn't actually have anything to do with it.

1120
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,400
That was the weird thing.

1121
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,440
It took me so long to learn that, friends.

1122
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,440
It's not your looks and it's not, it's certainly not your,

1123
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,500
well, unless we're talking about pinks.

1124
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,280
I'm talking to you folks, okay?

1125
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,340
Okay?

1126
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,640
It's not your car.

1127
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,820
It's not your money.

1128
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,980
It's not the way you dress.

1129
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:33,680
I managed to meet my true Yeti mate looking just as shabby as I do now.

1130
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,520
And that's by choice, by the way.

1131
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,640
It's more comfortable.

1132
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,180
And I don't have to work and deal with the public, except you.

1133
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,780
In fact, I never even wear a Bob T-shirt out in the neighborhood

1134
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,240
because why should they know, you know?

1135
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,560
I'm not trying to convert a bunch of pinks.

1136
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,000
We're making enough money to get by.

1137
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,140
If somebody's a subgenius, they'll find their way to us.

1138
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,640
We're not going to advertise.

1139
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,660
We're not selling underwear.

1140
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:10,200
We're not Scientology or the Rosicrucians or any of the other ones.

1141
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,140
You know who else doesn't advertise, who else doesn't sell ads?

1142
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,900
Mad Magazine.

1143
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,540
Or at least they didn't until about two years ago.

1144
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,940
And that was when I dropped my subscription.

1145
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,000
Can you believe it, how sad it is?

1146
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,860
The Onion runs ads for themselves.

1147
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,340
Church of the Subgenius runs ads for itself.

1148
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,480
And you folks out there trying to get laid,

1149
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,960
all I can say is the best way to run an ad for yourself is

1150
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,600
it sounds so corny and I don't know how else to say it,

1151
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,980
but be yourself.

1152
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,680
How do you do that?

1153
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,680
Well, that's like finding out what your real slack is.

1154
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,880
You know, well, goddammit, I can't get slack if I can't get laid.

1155
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,680
I don't know a damn thing yet.

1156
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,240
And I can't give you a magic answer.

1157
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,260
All I can say is that the truest form of time control is patience.

1158
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:15,380
And you may have to wait 50 years to meet that true Yeti mate.

1159
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,520
And even if it's 50 years of God's grace,

1160
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,620
and you only have the true Yeti mate for 5 years before somebody dies of brain cancer,

1161
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,160
it's worth it!

1162
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,160
Don't kill yourself yet!

1163
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,880
J.R. Bob Dobbs or God or somebody is gonna do it anyway!

1164
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:39,000
And they are professionals and know what they're doing.

1165
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,940
By definition, you, as a non-dead person, are a complete amateur at suicide.

1166
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
I could suggest people who might be,

1167
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,860
might be able to help you, like Dr. LeHune here,

1168
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,320
but, um, you know, my point is,

1169
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,820
uh, you don't know the future.

1170
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,420
We all learn that.

1171
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,780
Bob taught us that in the conspiracy, what the conspiracy called 1998.

1172
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,480
You don't know the future.

1173
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,500
And, uh, you don't know whether you're gonna have to wait 50 years to get laid,

1174
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,440
or if you're never gonna get laid,

1175
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,620
or if you're gonna get laid tonight!

1176
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,200
In fact, I almost kinda wish it would rain,

1177
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,600
cause that's when the shy people get stuck together.

1178
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,860
And some little shelter, you know,

1179
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,840
with caffinas, or, uh, down at the Grindhouse.

1180
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,760
That Grindhouse is gonna be open all night, friends.

1181
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,680
I have a suggestion, Sam.

1182
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,460
And, you know, you might just, uh, go down there.

1183
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,360
You know how you used to get loony doos,

1184
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,200
try to pick up girls, and slip your arm around them, and then they'd age away?

1185
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,100
Like, you might just go down there and say,

1186
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,300
anybody who wanna fuck, goddammit, I'm really, I'm desperate.

1187
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,500
You may, who knows?

1188
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,460
You may have ten people racing.

1189
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,900
You may have ten people who want to kiss their hand.

1190
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,580
Some of them might even be of the desired sex!

1191
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,400
So, uh, you know, I'm just, uh, telling you,

1192
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,380
this is just my advice off the top of my head,

1193
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,860
to some of you who are couples, have, whatever,

1194
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,660
you're settled down, everything's fine,

1195
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,600
or you're couples, and it's a little awkward still,

1196
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,760
or always will be, who knows, you know.

1197
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,820
But, goddammit, you don't know the future!

1198
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,160
Only J.R. Bob does!

1199
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,620
Only J.R. Bob Dobbs can judge a book by its cover,

1200
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,620
and he's the only one who can say who that, uh,

1201
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,720
your perfect true yeti mate is before you find it.

1202
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,800
And, uh, so trust, trust in Bob,

1203
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,920
and don't kill yourself yet.

1204
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,700
Keep up the fib, the F-I-B, faith in Bob.

1205
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,600
That's all, that, you know, just stay alive until next day.

1206
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
That's all you have to do.

1207
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,840
If you get killed or something, there's nothing you can do about that.

1208
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,840
Ask Dr. Laguene.

1209
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,400
He's, I've been to his funeral, and then he died!

1210
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,000
And here he is!

1211
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,740
In fact, I remember, what year was that? 1995.

1212
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,000
Standing on a stage in Cleveland at his weight.

1213
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,920
People were really sad, people had never even met him.

1214
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,320
So I'd written, when I thought he was really dead,

1215
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,140
I'd written such a beautiful, a eulogy for him.

1216
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,340
And I, uh, I managed to, I got to the point where I said,

1217
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,720
goddammit, if there really was a J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1218
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,500
then Dr. Laguene would still be alive!

1219
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,840
And of course, that was his cue to step out of the coffin

1220
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,760
and pick me, literally pick me up and go,

1221
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,140
next time you think I'm dead, you better poke me with a stick!

1222
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,460
It was a beautiful moment, friends.

1223
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,780
That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

1224
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,100
Thinking the other guy's dead, and then finding that he's not after all.

1225
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,520
Unless you hated the other guy, in which case, great.

1226
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,620
So, that, uh, that about sums up my feelings for tonight.

1227
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,720
Thank you, uh, for your attention, everybody.

1228
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,860
I just wanted to encourage you to, uh, not die tonight

1229
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,120
just because you didn't get laid and you came to X Day.

1230
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,480
This is no different from high school.

1231
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,680
In fact, in some ways, as we've seen from the recent butt-hurtness,

1232
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,780
it is like the high school from hell.

1233
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,200
Yes, there are the Populars and the Bookworms

1234
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,680
and the Jocks and the Geeks and so forth.

1235
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,720
That will never change, even among the subgeniuses,

1236
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,300
and that's because, even though we may not be humans,

1237
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,540
we're still primates.

1238
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,240
And, uh, until the X's come,

1239
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,540
or even after the X's come, it's still gonna be the same way.

1240
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,920
It's probably just gonna be multiplied by a thousand.

1241
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,740
But, remember, you geeks,

1242
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,220
who's the richest guy in the world today?

1243
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,140
Uh, you know, who's the politician with the prettiest wife?

1244
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,340
Dennis Kucinich!

1245
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,840
The most insane geek in the world.

1246
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,960
What geek you ever saw in your life?

1247
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,740
Closest thing to a subgenius that you can vote for, I suppose.

1248
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,560
He's so nuts.

1249
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,200
And yet he's got the prettiest wife of any of those politicians.

1250
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,080
And, uh, I'm the stumpiest subgenius next to a couple of other fellas,

1251
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,220
and I've got the prettiest wife of any subgenius.

1252
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,680
So, how about that?

1253
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,680
See, you never know.

1254
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,660
You don't know everything.

1255
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,780
Even Dr. Howell doesn't know everything.

1256
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,180
I asked him a question,

1257
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,880
and he said he didn't know, and I have it on tape.

1258
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,800
I'm gonna ask him that question and ask Dr. Howell in a couple of days.

1259
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,620
He's a believer.

1260
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,920
And, friends, this brings us to the conclusion

1261
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,180
of this Hour of Slack,

1262
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,780
number one thousand something something something.

1263
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,580
Thirteen twenty-one.

1264
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,780
We'll put that in later.

1265
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,400
Thank you very much, uh, Elliot Sound,

1266
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,100
Pant Man, and Suds, Reverend Frodo Suds-Peshaw,

1267
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,720
who's making out with Pisces, grossly, right in front of everyone.

1268
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,660
As an example to all of us.

1269
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,380
Yes, uh, friends, that's the way you're supposed to do it.

1270
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,220
That's what you call a true Yeti mate.

1271
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,060
Little tap on, a little kiss on the cheek.

1272
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,940
A pick, yes.

1273
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,860
Um, uh, thank you, Dr. Howell,

1274
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,960
You're most welcome.

1275
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,840
Father Joe Mama,

1276
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,540
and, uh, and our listeners,

1277
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,260
who've been so very patient,

1278
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,100
staring at us as if we had something to say.

1279
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,220
Until the next time, this has been an official production

1280
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,660
of the Church of the Subgenius.

1281
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,200
Then for more information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1282
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:19,000
you may want to check out subgenius.com.

1283
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,840
Not to be confused with subgeniaus.com,

1284
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,180
which has two O's in it.

1285
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,260
Often imitated.

1286
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:26,820
One O too many.

1287
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,940
Never duplicated.

1288
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,440
Beware of imitations.

1289
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,620
Alright, we are, beware especially of, uh, crappy Canadian imitations.

1290
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,380
The pink Canucks are worse.

1291
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,620
Operators, standing by, dealers and acquirers welcome.

1292
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,200
Triple salvation or your most important.

1293
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:39,480
Money back.

1294
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,260
Riesman.

1295
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,960
Rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar.
