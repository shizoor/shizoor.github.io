00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,520
between speed and chaos and you need to wrestle it to the ground like a demon cobra and then when

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,580
that fear rises up in your belly you use it and you know that that fear is powerful because it

has been there for billions of years and it is good and you use it and you ride it you ride it

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,580

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:12,940


77
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:12,940


78
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:12,940


79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:12,940


80

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,500

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,020
We can lead the nation on a half a horse apiece

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,200
We can lead the nation on a half a horse apiece

93
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,600
I called up the president, said, how's it going, bub?

94
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,520
He said, I'm stuck up to my axle and I don't think it's good

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,920
What do you expect when the house is full of geese

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,180
And they rode to the capitol on half a horse apiece

97
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,280
Half a horse apiece, a half a horse apiece

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,480
They rode out of the capitol on half a horse apiece

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,940
You might lean to the left, I might lean to the right

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,100
Come on, dance with me, baby, till the wee hours of the night

101
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,020
If I can learn to dance with these two left feet

102
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,460
Let's hope for the nation on a half a horse apiece

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,560
Hope for the nation on a half a horse apiece

104
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,740
Remember, my friends, this ain't a sporting event

105
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,180
Nobody gets to lose, and nobody gets to win

106
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,380
The art of the compromise is what my baby needs

107
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,660
I'll meet you in the middle on a half a horse apiece

108
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,640
A half a horse apiece, a half a horse apiece

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll meet you in the middle on a half a horse apiece

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,940
A half a horse apiece, a half a horse apiece

111
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,180
I'll meet you in the middle on a half a horse apiece

112
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,240
Meet me in the middle

113
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,060
I was wrong about you, Bobby.

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,720
You are not the one to defeat me.

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,800
Tell Cal not to take Bobby out.

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,880
Hey, Cal.

117
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,000
Listen, I hate to add to your tremendous moral confusion,

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,020
but I just heard he said to take Bobby out of the race,

119
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,820
and you're fired, buddy.

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,060
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,140
You tell him if he doesn't do it, he's done.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,240
That's right.

123
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,580
Will you tell him Mr. Bobby is my best friend?

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
Bad news for Bobby.

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,500
Who's in there?

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
Uh, yes.

127
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,960
Who's out there?

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,780
Bob, sir.

129
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,280
Oh, I understand, sir.

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
And I didn't see you here tonight.

131
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,200
I really appreciate that, Bob.

132
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah, thanks a lot, Bob.

133
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,700
There he goes.

134
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,820
There he goes.

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,420
Me.

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
And Bob.

137
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,700
Then you.

138
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,460
And me again.

139
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,140
Then Bob.

140
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,460
You and I are a part of a church that has not only listened the message,

141
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,360
but he has given us incredibly the means of getting to the entire world.

142
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,540
We have these in a number of languages.

143
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,020
I can't even tell you all the languages.

144
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,720
But listen, our goal is to keep putting them in as many languages as possible.

145
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,160
If we, if we, if we, and, and, and, and what we're choosing primarily, listen,

146
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,780
and even today, the ministry is in the most spoken languages in the world.

147
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,360
Places like that, they have millions and millions of people in their languages.

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,940
And imagine sending these things all over the world.

149
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,820
And here's what happens.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,600
People drop them, lose them.

151
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,100
Somebody comes along and says, hmm, looks like I got something here.

152
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,940
Turn that thing on and hear this voice and say,

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,660
I got something about it.

154
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
Use the milkshake.

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,740
Use the milkshake.

156
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
Use the milkshake.

157
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,680
Got it?

158
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,400
Got it.

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,820
Yeah, I'm slacking a bit.

160
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,380
Bobby is now convinced that whatever is in the house has become more aggressive.

161
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,460
Stay with Bobby's parents for the week.

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
Leaving Bobby at home, alone.

163
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,380
Even enjoy the calm of nine days out as its morning to bite.

164
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,200
But when the kı Construction.

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,320
In time of peace and too in time of war

184
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I smoked two joints before I smoked two joints

185
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,420
And then I smoked two more

186
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh, my daddy he once told me

187
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,860
Son, you be hard working man

188
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,340
My mama she once told me

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,920
Son, you do the best you can

190
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,920
But then one day I met a man

191
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Who came to me and said

192
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,100
Hard work good and hard work fine

193
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,120
But first take care of him

194
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,980
So now I smoke two joints

195
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,380
When I get up in the car

196
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,600
I smoke two joints

197
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,660
I smoke two joints when I play video games

198
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,800
And at every ten thousand points

199
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,040
I smoke two joints

200
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,980
I smoke two joints in time of peace

201
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,080
And two in time of war

202
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,140
I smoked two joints before I smoked two joints

203
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,020
And then I smoked two joints

204
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,020


205
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
And then I smoked two joints

206
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,480
Another natural product made better by chemistry is

207
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,120
Marijuana

208
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Years of research were necessary in order to improve the product

209
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,760
But it doesn't take long for the drug habit to make anyone over

210
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,200
In all the colors of the rainbow

211
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,500
A few years back the United States of America had nearly gone crazy

212
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,660
They were lining up dope peddlers and shooting them in the back of the head

213
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,540
Just take it or leave it

214
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,800
Then it's chemistry to the rescue

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
The answer is a simple one

216
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,180
Just use your head

217
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,860
But there's one sure thing

218
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,460
If you use narcotics

219
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,720
The horizon is unlimited

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Talk to someone who has had the experience

221
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,120
All around us are the products of modern chemistry

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,700
Heroin, morphine, reds, crack, sleeping pills

223
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,480
Something that came out of a test tube

224
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,280
Created in the chemist's laboratory

225
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,900
By a miracle of modern science

226
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,560
Folded into a compact little package

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,780
Many times as strong

228
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,980
And the dope addicts say

229
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,860
Yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in

230
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,400
Something that came out of a test tube

231
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,380
Is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces

232
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,320
Of useful life

233
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,600
Most teenagers start off with marijuana

234
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Some of the boys smoke them

235
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,520
You know, the ones with backbones

236
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,080
My girlfriend Ann and I went around with Bob

237
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,380
They both smoked pop

238
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,520
That's jive talk for marijuana

239
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,340
So I tried it

240
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,720
Funny what it does to you

241
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,880
Everything speeds up to a hundred miles an hour

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,980
There was something intriguing and different

243
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,640
When I came home high that night

244
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,100
You're real sharp and you laugh a lot

245
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,620
You're the biggest person in the world

246
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,720
All you think about day and night is

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,740
The radiance of sparkling colors

248
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,300
And then you pass out

249
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,560
But when you wake up it starts all over again

250
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,700
And that's the story

251
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,360
Unbelievable, isn't it?

252
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,540
Chemistry takes a turn

253
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,900
It's a hand in such commonplace things as

254
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
Dope traffic in the United States

255
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,340
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics

256
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,680
Is a thing of beauty

257
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,100
Carrying off the harmful fumes

258
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,980
From other chemical processes

259
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,500
There's always the gentle dew

260
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,880
Which cover the surface with a film of gritty scratching particles

261
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,780
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you

262
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,540
It does

263
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,560
Some young man may develop startling

264
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,760
Stupid, ghastly, tragic

265
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,360
Hidden secrets of nature

266
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
The pioneer of tomorrow

267
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,960
Did you get a little pinch of this, a dash of that?

268
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Sometimes referred to in the trade as a sleeping beauty boilermaker

269
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,780
Take no notice if he begins to levitate

270
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,340
It's a common side effect

271
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,240
I don't mean to interrupt

272
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,720
I mean, I...

273
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,220
I'd like to mention that

274
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,640
Some of you young people

275
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,420
Might be especially interested

276
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,880
In our novel and quaint gourmet's drug culture

277
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
Here in the future

278
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,000
First off, you can try our atomic dirt

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
It's very organic

280
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,040
Some of our more rowdy and dissatisfied teens

281
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,440
Will eject only once, of course

282
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,040
Pure cancer for that indescribable three-week death rush

283
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,600
We have a disease called communicable stupor

284
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,240
Or the drug bug

285
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,040
A contagious hallucinogenic state

286
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,720
Which passes swiftly from one person to another

287
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,440
And makes them happy

288
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
Whether they want to be or not

289
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
Always a thriller when unexpected

290
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,960
Listen and see

291
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:41,960


292
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,220
porque te invito

293
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,620
to stop

294
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:54,820
I had a little ping

295
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,100
Then you wanted your bar

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,680
All right, back to there

297
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:56,680


298
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:56,680


299
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,860
Ch extension

300
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
awi

301
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,240
Daddy beat up Mommy and broke her collar

302
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,380
Moaned for good luck and everybody's drunk

303
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,200
And everybody's wasted

304
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,420
And everybody's drinking on the job

305
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,380
The farmer he got plowed

306
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,600
The bricklayer got plastered

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,900
The mechanic he got tanked

308
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,560
And the construction worker got blasted

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,200
In Kansas City, New York City

310
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,920
Great big city, itty bitty city

311
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,380
Now everybody's drunk

312
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,040
And everybody's wasted

313
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,240
And everybody's drinking on the job

314
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Well there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been

315
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,480
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen

316
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,940
A whole lot of things I'll never be

317
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,700
The generation that would change the world

318
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,020
Is still looking for its car keys

319
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,140
The

320
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,140


321
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,140


322
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,340
Please

323
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,460
Please

324
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,640
Please

325
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,240
Please

326
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,460
Please

327
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,500
Please

328
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:35,840
Please

329
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:35,860
Please

330
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,220
Please

331
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,220


332
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,220


333
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,280
Please

334
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:48,780
guitar solo

335
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,660
The terrorists got bombed

336
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,980
The president got hit

337
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,500
Security was tight

338
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,100
Yeah, the Secret Service got lit

339
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,180
The FBI, the CIA, DWI

340
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,480
USA, everybody's drunk

341
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
And everybody's wasted

342
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,260
And everybody's wasted

343
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,580
Everybody's stolen

344
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,540
There's nothing, nothing gonna change it

345
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,420
Cause everybody's drunk

346
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,100
And everybody's wasted

347
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,320
And everybody's drinking all the time

348
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,360
Hey, Rich!

349
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,940
I got all the words, I just got them in the wrong order

350
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,480
Man, you should not have bought me all those Guinness before we started

351
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,220
I mean, man, this is our, this, this is our job

352
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,580
Good work if you can get it

353
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,700
And with your kids

354
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,080
Right in the front row, man

355
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,160
I love it

356
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,420
Oh yeah

357
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm drinking

358
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,460
I said I'm drinking

359
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,680
Oh yeah

360
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,120
Oh baby, I'm drinking

361
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,440
Drinking on the job

362
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm just not a coffee lover

363
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,960
I think what makes folks need to be taught about coffee

364
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,700
Is because some people drink it religiously

365
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah

366
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,280
They have to have it

367
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,460
They can't make them without it

368
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,120
They build their life around coffee

369
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,500
Like a drug addict does

370
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,960
And some folks build their life around RC

371
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,780
And coke

372
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:05,780
Yeah

373
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:19,520
How many more because I make, like, $2 impact water

374
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


375
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,860
Yo man ciao

376
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:35,200
发

377
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,180
prove it. You know, it was...

378
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,780
We'll come right back, ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,700
to Mr. Lynch and Mr. Greenwood

380
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,620
after these words from our sponsor.

381
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,200
Unfortunately,

382
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,360
dear friends, our

383
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,720
sponsor could not be

384
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,700
here tonight. J.R. Bob Dobbs

385
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,600
was busy elsewhere

386
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,260
out in the world, and

387
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,720
that's just

388
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,880
too bad. However, I did

389
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,060
get my headphones working.

390
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,460
Just barely. Yay!

391
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,940
And, um...

392
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,580
Uh...

393
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,220
Yes, yes, in any

394
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,060
minute now, we should be joined

395
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
by the

396
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,020
Lone Cow.

397
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,280
That song, Drinking on the Job

398
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,000
there, was by the

399
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,520
Rainmakers, of course,

400
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,780
who also did the opening song,

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,700
Half a Horse a Piece,

402
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,120
which I think may be the world's only

403
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,040
pro-compromise

404
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,420
protest song.

405
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,160
I really

406
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,940
like that one.

407
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,860
It's my motto.

408
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
Those are from a live

409
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,960
performance DVD called

410
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,240
25 On.

411
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
They also have a new album. The Rainmakers

412
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,880
have a new album called 25 On

413
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,760
of new songs, but the live

414
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,720
thing has a lot of

415
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,480
oldies, too. It's great.

416
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Longtime

417
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,920
hour of Slack listeners are probably

418
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,580
going, oh, no, it's gonna be

419
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,740
nothing but Rainmakers for the

420
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,880
rest of the

421
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,080
year, an hour of Slack.

422
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,020
Yeah.

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,980
And it'll also be Lonesome Cowboy

424
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,940
Dave. Of the Huffytown

425
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,020
Poots. The Huffytown Poots.

426
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,740
And they were with, oh, and before

427
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,560
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Huffytown Poots,

428
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,420
the Toys did

429
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,020
Smoke Two Joints.

430
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,800
The main collage was by The Large,

431
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,780
although the Bishop did

432
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,880
the Marijuana Collage.

433
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,900
And there was a clip from my underground

434
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,780
movie, Let's Visit the World of the

435
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,480
Future, as seen on YouTube.

436
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
The background music is

437
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,920
The Psychoskeletons.

438
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
And this is

439
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,420
Dave World.

440
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,260
What a world it is, too.

441
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,260
Hardly anyone breathes above

442
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,320
the water. Most people's nostrils are

443
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,560
the size of dishes. Their eyes

444
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,380
and their ears were made for other things.

445
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,020
Supersonic listening.

446
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,560
Supersonic seeing.

447
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Super hyper

448
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,300
engaging of the enemy.

449
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,460
You were about to say something dirty, weren't you?

450
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,400
Yeah, I was.

451
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:00,900
Something dirty.

452
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
More humorous to get engaged to an enemy

453
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,700
because then that would be a hell of a marriage.

454
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,980
Yeah.

455
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:08,660
Yeah.

456
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,500
Oh, well.

457
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,260
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

458
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,860
There's another Princess We Laugh.

459
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,280
I collected...

460
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,040
Delightful accent.

461
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,280
You know, I collect Princess We Are

462
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,360
No Laughs, and I got a

463
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,500
really good one one drunken night

464
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,560
at X-Day, thanks to those zombies

465
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,840
Reverend Nikki Deathchick

466
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,340
and Bob Wild were making.

467
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,360
And

468
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,660
I used it three or four times

469
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,940
on the last hour of Slack.

470
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,560
And people have told me

471
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,400
that they're trying to figure out how to use it

472
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,440
as a ringtone.

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,620
Well, you are one hell

474
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,180
of a woman.

475
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,420
The way you can see into the future

476
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,640
and predict the past is beyond reason.

477
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,500
What? You're talking about

478
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,600
a different space princess.

479
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,840
There is no future or past for Princess We.

480
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,580
Yeah, I noticed you predicated

481
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,200
with that space princess.

482
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,900
She's in the now.

483
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,680
Where times were laws of nature

484
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,940
and physics do not apply.

485
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,480
Oh, that reminds me.

486
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,600
I found a note I'd made to myself

487
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,760
to start the...

488
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,280
Something about the movement to eliminate now.

489
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,680
Now?

490
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,540
Yes, it was a movement to just end now.

491
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,280
The concept of now.

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,300
And allow only past and future,

493
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,780
but no more of that little micro nanosecond

494
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,140
of a nothingness point.

495
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,940
Sliding along the time bar.

496
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,760
That's where Princess We lives.

497
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,820
It's that non-existent point

498
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,480
where everything is the now.

499
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,980
The now.

500
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,240
Whereas I'm like a...

501
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,540
a...

502
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:43,920
a...

503
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,140
a...

504
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,240
a...

505
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,360
a...

506
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,380
a...

507
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,460
a...

508
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:45,480
a...

509
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,520
a...

510
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,580
a...

511
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,100
a...

512
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,180
a...

513
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,180


514
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,400
a...

515
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,460
a...

516
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:46,800
a...

517
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
a...

518
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,440
a...

519
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,000
a...

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,140
a...

521
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,860
a...

522
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
a...

523
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,220
band.

524
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,920
Who is old now.

525
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,380
But it doesn't have any...

526
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,780
Weren't you guys the Radio Alarm Clocks?

527
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,260
We were just the Clocks.

528
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,060
The Clocks.

529
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240
They said there was some

530
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,460
band that just signed.

531
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,020
That used to be important.

532
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,900
They just signed with a major label in Chicago called

533
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,880
The Clocks. And they had just

534
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,200
adopted the name recently and they were a bunch of

535
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,940
punks in a bad way.

536
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,020
Well, there's some other Cleveland

537
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,200
band of the day called the Alarm

538
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,140
Clocks. I know when you heard that you wanted to

539
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,980
clock them. It's confusing to me, but I guess

540
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,480
if they want to steal from the

541
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,240
originators in the past of their own

542
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,420
dirty feet, then let

543
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,500
them pursue it. Well, we had

544
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,300
a friend whose

545
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,640
band, one man band, was called

546
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,480
Man.

547
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,900
Man Rock. He

548
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,240
played bass and drum.

549
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,020
He played the drum with his foot

550
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
and played the bass and he sang.

551
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,140
He did punk songs. They were

552
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,920
really good.

553
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,140
But it turned out there had been some

554
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,420
ancient British band called

555
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,260
Man. He had to change his name to

556
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,300
Man Incorporated, which just didn't have quite the

557
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,920
same punch.

558
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,420
The same punch.

559
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,600
Hey, speaking of bands

560
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,160
and paranoia in America, which is what I've been

561
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,060
thinking about lately.

562
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Oh, there's music in the background?

563
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,640
It's not real music.

564
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,900
It's not real music.

565
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:41,900


566
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah, it is.

567
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,480
It's in fact, Princess We is on it.

568
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,740
I think it's jamming from X Day.

569
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,620
Last X Day drill.

570
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,100
It has an effective undertone.

571
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,820
Actually, this isn't the part with We on it because it doesn't have the flute.

572
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,480
The flute part is coming up and it's like ten minutes long.

573
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,560
Oh, no.

574
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,560
I could switch to the instrumental by the it's the Rolling Stones.

575
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,880
Greatest hits as played by the Rockville Orchestra.

576
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,940
And Rockville.

577
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,220
Uh, somewhere.

578
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,240
Uh huh.

579
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Yeah, somewhere.

580
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,460
And it's like elevator music.

581
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,400
Rolling Stones.

582
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,160
It's great.

583
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,500
It's perfect background stuff.

584
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,740
Anyway, Dave, did you hear about a some sort of rock and roll festival here in Ohio that

585
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,540
got busted on my or rather got harassed on my birthday called Root Wire?

586
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Was it Root Wire?

587
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,780
Was it the Red Gate Festival?

588
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,100
I don't know.

589
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,420
It's called Root Wire.

590
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,460
It's held at Kempner's Woods near Logan.

591
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,920
Near Logan.

592
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,420
Yes.

593
00:27:51,520 --> 00:28:01,180
And apparently it's like a music festival draws about 5000 people and 4980 of or and

594
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,900
20 of them didn't get busted.

595
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,180
But 80 of them did.

596
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,860
Unbelievable.

597
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,620
Well, it was one of those things where.

598
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,140
It's a mass arrest.

599
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,760
You know.

600
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,860
It was the cops did the thing that we've always.

601
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,960
You hear rumors about this at things like Starwood and it never really happened.

602
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,000
But in this case, it did happen.

603
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,500
I guess the cops just needed money for their department and they parked outside the the

604
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,860
festival and just stopped everybody coming and going.

605
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,560
Yeah.

606
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,240
And of course, they all had pot and they you know, so they managed to to.

607
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,360
There also was some idiot vendor who was selling for real drugs, LSD and heroin and

608
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,000
stuff fairly openly.

609
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,820
And he got busted by undercover cops.

610
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,900
But that also wrecked the owner, the campground owners liquor license.

611
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,200
And probably that town won't be getting the income from that festival anymore.

612
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,240
Nobody's going to want to go and get ambushed.

613
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,020
I used to do that.

614
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,200
I had a blast until they realized people might not want to come back to these.

615
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,860
Right.

616
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,500
That's actually there were there.

617
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,760
They were busting people at a Starwood about 15 years ago, but it wasn't for drugs.

618
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,220
It was for endangered animal parts like eagle feathers.

619
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,180
Yes.

620
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,760
I.

621
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,100
Yeah.

622
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:36,460
But but anyway, yeah, there was a there were there was a sad time there for those poor.

623
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,540
Oh, and this is a funny part of the.

624
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,260
The ones who only spoke Welsh.

625
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,060
Can you imagine?

626
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,500
Oh, it's a big nightmare.

627
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,720
You know, and of course, there would be the one cop who acts also speaks Welsh.

628
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,160
I heard what you said.

629
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,400
I thought like a lot.

630
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,840
And then.

631
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,300
Yeah.

632
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,620
But they the vendor who got busted, they.

633
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,560
Was a weenie man.

634
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,420
He had a lot of stuff.

635
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,580
And he had 68 fruity pebbles snacks that were laced.

636
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,560
63 brownies.

637
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,760
70 grams of liquid LSD.

638
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,520
Now, if that's for real, that's a lot.

639
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,760
That is a lot of a molecule.

640
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,000
And but here's the one that really got me.

641
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:28,160
The cops busted somebody with 25 pounds of nitrous oxide.

642
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,500
And since nitrous oxide is a gas, that's a lot of laughing gas.

643
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,040
Yes.

644
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
That's nothing to laugh at.

645
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,540
That's nothing to laugh at.

646
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,240
That's nothing to snicker about.

647
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,360
Canister that weighed 25 pounds.

648
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,400
Well, oh, you think they meant the canister.

649
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
We use those same.

650
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,520
We used to buy that stuff and just empty it out because we wanted to use the canisters

651
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,280
for subgenius souls.

652
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,480
And we do.

653
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,100
We still do.

654
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,760
That my basement's got 40,000 souls.

655
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah.

656
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,700
Something like that.

657
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,680
All told, I don't think all 40,000 souls weigh 24 pounds.

658
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,160
No.

659
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,860
Yeah.

660
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,340
They probably don't weigh an ounce.

661
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,540
Yeah.

662
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,920
I mean, I don't think they weigh an ounce.

663
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,240
Soul doesn't weigh much.

664
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,680
No.

665
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,400
It weighs a little bit.

666
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,320
No, it's like a microgram or something.

667
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,020
Just to, yeah, some guy kept weighing dead people before and after the moment of death,

668
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,600
and he was pretty sure that some people's souls are heavier than others.

669
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:22,900
Oh.

670
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,200
Yes.

671
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,540
Dr. Sinister, the poor heavy soul.

672
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Look at how soulful and his soul looks heavy.

673
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,400
I can see your aura, by the way.

674
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,340
Oh, yeah.

675
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
Yeah, it looks awful.

676
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,240
What color is it?

677
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,740
Kind of a puke-ish.

678
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,540
Yeah.

679
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,840
It's a greenish yellow with lumps in it.

680
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,880
Nauseating blueish greenish yellowish.

681
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,120
It smells bad.

682
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,740
No offense, man.

683
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,860
I mean, but we're all here in this little radio studio.

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,620
It's kind of like that.

685
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:46,840
Yeah, I know.

686
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,520
You know, it's best for me to clean my aura out before coming into an enclosed space.

687
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,280
I understand it.

688
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,760
Bad soul.

689
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,140
I failed.

690
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,160
I know, and the place is littered with spiritual pubic hairs.

691
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,380
That's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, heard, or smelled.

692
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,420
Now, you weren't getting Dr. Sinister's aura confused with the wall color.

693
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,140
I don't know what color in this room.

694
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,400
Were you, Reverend Stang?

695
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,940
No.

696
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,440
Okay.

697
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,340
Just wanted to make sure, because it is kind of a puke green.

698
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Puke green wall color?

699
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,240
I have never puked up anything that color.

700
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,920
Except for this one time.

701
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,100
That's designed to relax the inmates.

702
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,220
They should have put a pink thing there.

703
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,560
It's up to the bad guacamole, right?

704
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,380
Yeah.

705
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,240
Brain-eating amoebas will do that to you.

706
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,100
There's been a lot of those in the news lately.

707
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,340
The brain-eating amoeba?

708
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,400
Nefertiti something fowleride.

709
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


710
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


711
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


712
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


713
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,400


714
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,140
Or something like that.

715
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
I can't remember its exact name.

716
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,240
It's a large amoeba.

717
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,360
Viva amoeba?

718
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,680
Yeah.

719
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,880
I wonder what Tommy Amoeba has to say about the brain-eating amoebas.

720
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,120
It's like, oh, he raises them.

721
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,220
He's got a whole collection of them inside his skull.

722
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,260
How do you think he got that way?

723
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,500
I've got a nice recording of Amoeba Knievel, his band from Pittsburgh.

724
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,140
How do you think he got those other parts?

725
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,380
I don't know.

726
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,480
I don't remember.

727
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,180
Is that a pseudopod or are you just happy to see me?

728
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,400
They have trouble getting hard, the amoebas do.

729
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,480
Yes, I used that with a zucchini joke.

730
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,540
They don't have that spine or anything, or an exoskeleton, anything.

731
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,740
The brain-eating amoeba, though, friends, here in Ohio, we don't have to worry too much

732
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:36,820
because they seem to grow only in hot, brackish, freshish water.

733
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,380
That's the thing.

734
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,460
Presence of remains is the greatest.

735
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:59,300
You gave seasoned science students the opportunity to study Amoeba's needs.

736
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
And thebturn was going to pull something out of it.

737
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,120


738
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,240
Yes, im going to do a recent analysis of teachers say that fejustfive pennypl Nosy

739
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,760
i that only if i found an actual underlying religion of their Christopher

740
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,880
den ammo.

741
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,420
Hens and rattlesnake hunts in Texas, in that part of Texas.

742
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,540
Why not brain-eating amoeba hunts?

743
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,180
Yeah, why not?

744
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,920
The same way with a vat full of brain-eating amoebas.

745
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,680
They grow to be about, I mean, they're visible amoebas.

746
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,140
They're not so tiny.

747
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,240
You can't see them.

748
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,820
You know, there have been amoebas that were like this big.

749
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,360
No, I didn't know.

750
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,440
You must remember you're on the radio when you say this big.

751
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,820
One cell.

752
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,820
Yay big.

753
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,320
Yay big.

754
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Yeah, well, I was holding my hand out.

755
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,940
This far apart.

756
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,380
Come on, man.

757
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,040
How specific do you want me to get?

758
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,280
I know it is TV.

759
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:54,320
Actually, the bigger a cell gets, the less efficiently it can exchange nutrients and waste products and whatnot with its outside environment.

760
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,720
That's why cells don't get to be gigantic.

761
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,020
Yeah, or at least the intense desire to do so.

762
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,640
Yeah, there was a time when the oxygen was richer.

763
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,860
Insects could grow to be about, oh.

764
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,420
Three feet long.

765
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:07,680
It was gold in the wind.

766
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,500
But since they breed through holes in their size, it's hard to do anymore.

767
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,440
Spiracles, those holes are called.

768
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah.

769
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,980
It's like a form of alien smock.

770
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,440
It's when these particles, I mean, these amoebiums and paracetamethiums get together, you know?

771
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,460
It's like their own little fun fest.

772
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,460
And sometimes 800 of them get arrested for wearing noxious clothing.

773
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,780
Well, it is pretty noxious, you know.

774
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,380
Their taste.

775
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,040
Well, when you show it.

776
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,300
Protostimates.

777
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,300


778
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,780
Their own taste in clothes is famous for being.

779
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,040
You can be checked twice a day, you know.

780
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,080
It's an old joke, but it bears fruit.

781
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,960
Let's see what else I have on my.

782
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, see, I switched from staring at amoebas all day to staring at video games.

783
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,460
And that's been in the news lately, too.

784
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,580
Princess, you probably haven't heard this one yet.

785
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,020
Dang.

786
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,600
An eight-year-old should be staring at.

787
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,120
It's women's breasts.

788
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,060
Keep on saying that to yourself.

789
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,300
No video games.

790
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,560
It's called women's breasts.

791
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,860
Or you could, you know, say buttocks if you like.

792
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,280
If that had been the case, a little boy's grandma would still be alive today.

793
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,320
As a little kid who was being looked after by his grandma, who he loved,

794
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,420
he was staying at grandma's trailer court.

795
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Carnally.

796
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,520
And he'd been in the other room playing Grand Theft Auto 4.

797
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,980
And he finished playing the game and he went downstairs.

798
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,060
And got granny's gun and walked up behind granny and shot her in the back of the head.

799
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,260
An eight-year-old was playing Grand Theft Auto 4.

800
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,820
Right.

801
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Now, of course, immediately the Yahoo commenters were saying,

802
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,360
well, these video games make kids kill people.

803
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,600
And other people were going, no, guns kill people.

804
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,820
Others were going, no, guns don't kill people.

805
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,540
People were going, no, guns make it easy, real, real, real easy to kill people.

806
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,300
But Grand Theft Auto did, in fact, inspire an eight-year-old to go down and get some extra points.

807
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,940
By shooting grandma.

808
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,440
Actually, in the game itself, you would be penalized.

809
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,380
We don't know this as a gleaning of the news.

810
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
You might actually fail the mission if you were really playing the game.

811
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,040
Like multiple, I've played, that's one of my favorite video games, actually.

812
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,860
I'm looking forward to the sequel.

813
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,460
In a lot of missions, you are penalized for killing people.

814
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,160
Well, if you get caught, there's consequences.

815
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,020
You get caught in a lot of other missions.

816
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,720
Like you will specifically fail the mission if you kill, you know, certain people get killed.

817
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,280
No, but for the most part.

818
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,380
For the most part.

819
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,160
You kind of rack up general status by doing crime.

820
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,780
Not really.

821
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
You don't?

822
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,720
No, not really.

823
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,460
Well, I know some missions are really tricky.

824
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,540
Yeah, I mean, everybody plays the game differently.

825
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,340
Right, you can just run around killing people if you have cheap cards.

826
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,740
No, I've been playing, I've played the first couple of hours of three of those.

827
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,280
So I've, you know, I do like, I do enjoy the actual non-play.

828
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,280


829
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,280


830
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,280
I like the killing part where you have to.

831
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,840
Yeah, I get stuck, I get stuck just listening to the radio stations.

832
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,340
Right.

833
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,980
Yeah, the radio on Grand Theft Auto is better than what you're listening to now, I'll tell you.

834
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,720
Most definitely.

835
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,780
Well, they went to a lot of trouble, and that's why the subgenius game would cost so much to produce.

836
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,900
It would have to be better than Grand Theft Auto and have even more fake radio.

837
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,680
I think this is Reverend Angry Larry on guitar.

838
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,900
In the background, although it might be Suggs for sure.

839
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,360
Who's playing drums here?

840
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,900
Everybody.

841
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
Everybody but you, Dr. Sinister.

842
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,220
Well, there was a Reverend Bad Vibes, and there was a Reverend Biker Man.

843
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,360
And Ken Shover played drums.

844
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,720
That's Reverend Biker Man.

845
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,400
Oh, right.

846
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,880
Reverend, I peaked on you now.

847
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,740
Yeah, Reverend, I peaked on you now.

848
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,120
We, I don't, we've got to figure out what his real name is and put his name on the list.

849
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,440
Because Reverend Puked on You Now is not coming back.

850
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,940
The girls especially did not like Reverend Puked on You Now.

851
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,800
Very, very bad name.

852
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,600
Or Transgender Dressers, a very bad name.

853
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,700
No, no, you're thinking of somebody else.

854
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,480
Yeah.

855
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,880
You're thinking, I know who you're thinking of.

856
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,380
You're getting all burned on, aren't you?

857
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,480
Getting all hot and bothered, aren't you, Lone Cow?

858
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,460
Unfortunately, that's true.

859
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Well, not really.

860
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,880
No, I hear some hooting.

861
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,160
There's some flutes in the background.

862
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,720
There's been a lot of hooting throughout this whole piece.

863
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,440
Somebody going,

864
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,380
Pantera had a flute.

865
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,040
Dave, I think you need to adjust the gag on your prisoner.

866
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,400
We can hear them.

867
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Oh, actually, I should switch to different music.

868
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,720
I'll put on this Roqueville Orchestra.

869
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,180
I'm playing the Rolling Stones.

870
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,820
It's sickening.

871
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,280
It's really horrible.

872
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,900
Speaking of flutes, this is Sympathy for the Devil.

873
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,880
Obviously, elevator style.

874
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,300
I've been spending some time on the Internet and watching TV news.

875
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
Thanks, Dr. Legume and Pockets.

876
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,280
And the world is really scary on the Internet.

877
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,280
You read the Internet.

878
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,520
You read the news article, and there's the most horrendous, racist, strife-creating crap.

879
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:50,880
See, I haven't seen it so bad since I was a kid in 1959.

880
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,100
Let me tell you something right here.

881
00:40:53,620 --> 00:41:00,520
WCSB talk shows were the precursor for Internet Message Board anonymous comments.

882
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,380
The trolls in your life?

883
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,860
Yeah, yeah.

884
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,260
We've had a troll problem for, you know, 20-plus years.

885
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,920
Well, your show was built on troll meat, so to speak.

886
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,740
I mean, you had...

887
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,040
Troll meat?

888
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,220
No, but I do wear a troll bone helmet.

889
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:26,240
But, I mean, the world of the Internet and the world of the news is not like the world

890
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:33,320
that I go to when I walk out of my house and, like, go shopping or go to a block party and

891
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,540
so forth.

892
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,260
I want to go to a crazy world.

893
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,360
The People's Republic of Cleveland Bluffs?

894
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:38,980
Yeah.

895
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,760
The people seem to be not only getting along with each other, they're miscegenating and

896
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
having babies together and making out and stuff.

897
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,360
There may be some...

898
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,640
In the parking lot?

899
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,740
I have no doubt.

900
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,520
Of course, there's still...

901
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,920
Breastfeeding children in public places.

902
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:00,240
You can tell by the people saying there's no racism anymore that it's as bad as it ever

903
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,880
was.

904
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,900
Yeah, I know that.

905
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,120
The way they go about trying to say that...

906
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,780
Ooh.

907
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,060
Yeah.

908
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,240
That's...

909
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,960
says it all.

910
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,240
But that's not what they're trying to say.

911
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,120
I wonder how sincere a lot of the racism

912
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,980
you see out there really is, though.

913
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,220
Well, and how much of it is just trying to

914
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,740
stir the pot.

915
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,000
How much of it is just

916
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,820
people trying to... It's media-driven

917
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,560
in a lot of ways because of your...

918
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Just trying to stir it up.

919
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,120
When people get along and do

920
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,920
unto others, that makes zero

921
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,480
news.

922
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,140
And that's

923
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,980
mostly what's going on out there.

924
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,440
In the world.

925
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,840
If you never leave your house, though,

926
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,420
and you absorb

927
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,820
everything through the media,

928
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,580
it's going to make you

929
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,460
paranoid.

930
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,900
Big time. Mean world syndrome.

931
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,660
Yes.

932
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,740
And you wouldn't even have sympathy

933
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,660
for the devil.

934
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,480
The devil!

935
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,820
But it's not non-stop racial

936
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,660
strife where I live.

937
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,820
It only is on my computer screen.

938
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,820
Now, we live in a fairly nice

939
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,980
neighborhood, but it's mixed.

940
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,600
It's a very, very

941
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
mixed neighborhood, and it mixes

942
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,760
fine.

943
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,000
So, go figure.

944
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,440
You know what it is?

945
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,120
People in my neighborhood

946
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,680
tend to have jobs, so they're not

947
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,280
desperate.

948
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,460
And they're not angry.

949
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,480
And they may

950
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,600
be overcharging for

951
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,500
some things. But it makes for a

952
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,660
happy, peaceful neighborhood.

953
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,580
Yes, it's strange to say,

954
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,820
but those do exist in a few places.

955
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,620
Now, watch us get home and find

956
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,000
our house has been broken into.

957
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,480
There's another one, and we

958
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,320
laughed for you.

959
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,480
I had just released

960
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,360
a valve, and I noticed

961
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,620
an incident that actually

962
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,580
happened in my town, and I

963
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,560
saw the tail end of it. It was a bunch of police cars,

964
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,860
and there were a bunch of

965
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,340
racially mixed, normal,

966
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,760
American kids all together.

967
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,900
And some redneck had

968
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,360
exploded on them, and went

969
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,260
into the store and tried to pick a fight

970
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,180
because there were too many

971
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,400
darned N-word kids in front

972
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,340
of the store. She called the

973
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,400
police. She said, get your buns

974
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,300
out of here. Those kids are waiting for the mom

975
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,000
to pick them up.

976
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,440
And I know where this comes from.

977
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,240
It's media-driven. Just listen to

978
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,160
the AM radio.

979
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,760
Or sit in there reading.

980
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,620
People have nothing else to do with their lives.

981
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,480
Actually, if you listen,

982
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,380
to enough AM radio, you will eventually learn

983
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,820
that it is liberals who are the real racists.

984
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,800
That's all they ever say on AM radio.

985
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,400
That doesn't take long to get to...

986
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,360
Right. Well, I've noticed

987
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,440
that what they mostly talk about is

988
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,400
not what they have to say themselves,

989
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,020
but, quote, what

990
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,920
liberals say.

991
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,780
Yes.

992
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,860
What they believe.

993
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,560
I know a lot of liberals, and every now

994
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,520
and then you'll run into one that's the cartoon

995
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,400
that Rush likes to present, but

996
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,080
very rarely, actually.

997
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,840
Most of them are just

998
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,320
Joe Lunchvale going to work

999
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,140
or trying to.

1000
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,640
Cussing at his

1001
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,480
fellow drivers.

1002
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,240
Going, you welfare queens.

1003
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,680
None of them have jobs.

1004
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, then it's funny. It's like,

1005
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,860
the people who are saying...

1006
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,380
The people who say

1007
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,460
all that sure seem to have a lot of time

1008
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,480
to sit on other people's websites

1009
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,520
and radio shows saying that.

1010
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,500
They say that

1011
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,400
a lot.

1012
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,380
You wonder,

1013
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,620
when they have time to get their jobs done.

1014
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,800
And you notice many of these

1015
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,580
people who complain about

1016
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,880
all the different so-called

1017
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,820
what you call it?

1018
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,820
I forgot the word.

1019
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,700
The privileges we get

1020
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,820
from having a government that doesn't want us

1021
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,620
to necessarily starve. What do they call those?

1022
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,120
The...

1023
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
Loll socialism?

1024
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,340
The socialism. These people have no experience

1025
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,280
with these things. They were calling

1026
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,260
Senor Obama a Stalinist.

1027
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh, yeah.

1028
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,660
To them, a Nazi,

1029
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,920
a Muslim, a communist are all

1030
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,780
the same thing.

1031
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,820
And a liberal. Those are all the same thing.

1032
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,200
Nazis, communists, Muslims, liberals.

1033
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,260
They hate America.

1034
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,160
They hate our freedoms.

1035
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,100
I am told that all day long

1036
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,760
on the media,

1037
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,960
which in the same breath

1038
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,700
is telling me that the media is controlled

1039
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,640
by those same evil liberals

1040
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,100
that they won't shut up about.

1041
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,840
Don't dare investigate that

1042
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,560
unholy trance.

1043
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:35,920
I ain't old.

1044
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,600
Who needs to investigate it?

1045
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,140
If you have eyes to see, it's pretty obvious.

1046
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,220
And if you do

1047
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,760
the investigating, it becomes

1048
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,960
really puke-inducing. Almost like

1049
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,640
poor Dr. Sinister's soul.

1050
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,420
I don't know what that means, but it had to...

1051
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,820
You can't get no

1052
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,480
satisfaction.

1053
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,840
We know the oinkments do work upon

1054
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,220
occasion.

1055
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,300
I like the Devo version.

1056
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,540
I have a

1057
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,060
great rant that

1058
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,320
the good Reverend Roger

1059
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,040
wrote, but

1060
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,600
now I feel like I'd be stealing

1061
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,540
from Dave and

1062
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,560
we and Sinister to read it.

1063
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,540
So I'll do that some other time.

1064
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,340
I'm warning. That's just a warning.

1065
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,040
Take it and run.

1066
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,560
I do

1067
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,720
have a song that I want to play

1068
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,360
at the end of this show

1069
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,280
called

1070
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,360
There's a Frop

1071
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:35,560
Frop.

1072
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,040
Frop Farm.

1073
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,140
By the Mutant Mountain Boys

1074
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,960
live at 6T next day.

1075
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,420
That's five minutes.

1076
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,120
We can do that in the last

1077
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,300
five

1078
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,660
minutes.

1079
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,100
If we have the right diagrams and measurements.

1080
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,260
I have those.

1081
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,780
If we have the right feet like Mercury's

1082
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,160
winged feet.

1083
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,320
Reverend Stang has the time control.

1084
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,080
Yes, I have the time control.

1085
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,180
Everyone has

1086
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,740
the space control.

1087
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,220
Next.

1088
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,200
I have the time control.

1089
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,360
I was reading

1090
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,160
a novel.

1091
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,820
I was reading a novel

1092
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,440
that's set in the late 1600s.

1093
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,200
It's partially about the birth

1094
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,820
of science.

1095
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,880
And

1096
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,660
these guys are really

1097
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,560
excited because somebody has just

1098
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,840
invented a clock with a second

1099
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,220
hand.

1100
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,300
Who's

1101
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,140
making that noise?

1102
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,600
That's Dave's prisoner.

1103
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,340
I told him to adjust his prisoner's gang.

1104
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,520
That is his prisoner.

1105
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,080
Yes, it is.

1106
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,880
Are you sure that's not one of the owls?

1107
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,980
My dog wants out and I'm not letting him out.

1108
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,900
No, I don't think it is.

1109
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,960
I really think it's Dave's prisoner.

1110
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,700
He wants to get out now.

1111
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,140
He needs to adjust the ball gag in its mouth.

1112
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,820
That old man named Jake that he keeps in his basement?

1113
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,800
I thought he was dead.

1114
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,940
He wants out now.

1115
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,280
No.

1116
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,100
I may have let him out

1117
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,420
but I'm not letting him in right now.

1118
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,480
Oh, it's okay.

1119
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,340
I thought it was part of

1120
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,280
the bad X-Day band.

1121
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,680
It's actually a pretty good X-Day band.

1122
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah, but now

1123
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,320
it's not the X-Day band and we still

1124
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,800
have the moaning. So you see?

1125
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,200
You see?

1126
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,060
It's Dave's prisoner.

1127
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,120
Whatever made that noise,

1128
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,680
it ain't human

1129
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,920
and it ain't an animal.

1130
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,220
It's cathode.

1131
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,100
You go on down in that pit

1132
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,060
if you want to, Professor.

1133
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,420
Go ahead and try to communicate with that thing.

1134
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,560
One of the seals on the

1135
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,940
soul containment tanks

1136
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,480
broke and there's a

1137
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,820
soul on the loose.

1138
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,540
Scary. That is creepy.

1139
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,700
It's a very, very strange place.

1140
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,260
Palm trees, nauseous golf balls,

1141
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,300
all kinds of Mexican utensils.

1142
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,220
I can't really make anything out yet.

1143
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,120
Mexican utensils?

1144
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,280
Mexican utensils?

1145
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,720
For picking up, like, you know,

1146
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,220
corn on the cob things that look like little corns.

1147
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,660
They look like little tacos

1148
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,780
and you stick them in your taco

1149
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,980
when you're eating your taco.

1150
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,940
To hold it.

1151
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,120
Gently between your knees.

1152
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,940
Hey, speaking of golf balls between your knees,

1153
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,420
Princess, we and I went to

1154
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,980
a golf course that

1155
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,560
failed or

1156
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,260
went out of business and they're

1157
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,240
making it into a city park.

1158
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,980
It's a Cleveland Metro Park now.

1159
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,280
But it's still a golf course.

1160
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,920
A golf course that they're letting

1161
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,220
revert back to nature, but in the meantime

1162
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,200
it looks like a life

1163
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,260
after people

1164
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,460
golf course.

1165
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,440
But it's the only

1166
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,580
golf course where subgeniuses

1167
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,440
can walk around

1168
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,800
and fall in the sand traps,

1169
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,040
which have an odd type of

1170
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,180
surface growth

1171
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,880
on them.

1172
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,140
That's an actual kind of

1173
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,580
an eloquent

1174
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,040
superficial place.

1175
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,980
A giant antlion at the center.

1176
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,060
It would be a great place

1177
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,900
for giant antlions

1178
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,680
to get joggers.

1179
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,940
Yeah, and little speed

1180
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,740
to use it.

1181
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,200
It's horrible.

1182
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,460
I didn't want to sing it.

1183
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,000
It is really awful.

1184
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,140
The Rolling Stones performed

1185
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,620
by the Roqueville Orchestra.

1186
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,760
Well, friends, this will be the last time

1187
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,880
we play this. I'm quite fond of it myself.

1188
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,780
This particular song is just

1189
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,540
not very...

1190
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,880
Or Get Off My Lawn.

1191
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:35,840
Sing it now.

1192
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,400
Give me a shot to give me shelter.

1193
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,840
Oh, I can't wait to hear that.

1194
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,820
Sounds like we're picking out

1195
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,060
some Amish food right now.

1196
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,780
You have to actually stop it in order to be able

1197
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,440
to change tracks with these...

1198
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,660
Dave, what are you doing to that prisoner?

1199
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,680
I'm using my

1200
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,900
forward utensil.

1201
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,000
Here we go. The elevator version

1202
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,240
of Give Me Shelter.

1203
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,980
That's Dr. Sinister

1204
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,580
wrestling. That's cheating.

1205
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,040
You're embattling it

1206
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,780
even worse. Worser.

1207
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,080
You want it to be worser.

1208
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,740
He does want it to be worser.

1209
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,800
I can't wait for the rape and murder to come up.

1210
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,260
It's just a shadow wave.

1211
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,580
Blast it.

1212
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,240
It's just a snot away.

1213
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,560
Well, that's sad.

1214
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,140
It is.

1215
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,260
Snot is kind of a sad thing.

1216
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,380
It makes me yearn for the Tom Jones version

1217
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,600
of Give Me Shelter, which is actually pretty good.

1218
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,420
And it makes me yearn for it.

1219
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,420
It spells U-R-I-N-E.

1220
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,600
Well, Dave, we're coming near to the end of the show

1221
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,580
when I wanted to...

1222
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,220
Because we played a bunch of

1223
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,180
froppy songs at the beginning.

1224
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,200
That's all right. I'm already not...

1225
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,620
Yes, he hates to interrupt, but...

1226
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,140
Yeah.

1227
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,380
I wanted to play

1228
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,620
There's a Frop Farm Over Yonder

1229
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,180
by the Mutant Mountain Boys.

1230
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,180
And on his farm

1231
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,540
he had some froppy.

1232
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,260
Two of them

1233
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,240
are good-looking boys.

1234
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,500
One of them's just a boy.

1235
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,300
Don't care about him.

1236
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,500
I thought they were crustaceans of some kind.

1237
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,160
The Mutant Mountain Boys?

1238
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,520
You're going to go beat the dog up?

1239
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:31,800
What?

1240
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,140
Or beat up the dog.

1241
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,200
Whatever it is.

1242
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,820
For yelling and scratching at the door.

1243
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,220
He's not such a bad dog.

1244
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,540
No.

1245
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,740
It really sounds like a person

1246
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,140
pretending to be a dog.

1247
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:48,880
Yes, it does.

1248
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,220
That's worrisome.

1249
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,360
A person in pain.

1250
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,260
That only going out will relieve,

1251
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,620
even if he doesn't take a leak and just did already.

1252
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,800
Okay, well, I guess I'll be going.

1253
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,540
First it's the buzz,

1254
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,140
then it's the dog.

1255
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,080
The moaning dog.

1256
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,480
Oh, my God.

1257
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,000
Dave?

1258
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,100
He's himself hung up?

1259
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,420
That's the first.

1260
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,060
I've never seen that happen before.

1261
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,080
Maybe the...

1262
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,380
This dog was about to poop all over the floor.

1263
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,120
The prisoner may have rolled over

1264
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,900
and knocked the phone off the hook.

1265
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,840
Okay, here's the Mutant Mountain Boys live

1266
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,500
and unplugged since we lost power one night.

1267
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,280
Not our fault.

1268
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,260
Some guy ran into a pole.

1269
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,680
The whole town lost power.

1270
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,160
Yep.

1271
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,300
And luckily, we had a sideshow marvel

1272
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,540
and a bluegrass band.

1273
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,800
A bluegrass divo band.

1274
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,860
A bluegrass divo subgenius band.

1275
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,260
The Mutant Mountain Boys.

1276
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,080
Thank y'all.

1277
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,520
Now, this is a very serious song.

1278
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,320
So, just chill.

1279
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,320
¶¶

1280
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,660
¶¶

1281
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:51,980
¶¶

1282
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:51,980


1283
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,720
¶ Once my heart was bound in sorrow ¶

1284
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,420
¶ Like a mask and spare a say ¶

1285
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,620
¶ When the toilet ¶

1286
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,220
Back in Grindley

1287
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,680
And it drew me to come see

1288
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,360
And the sewage had formed a message

1289
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,920
It said 1-3-0-1-3

1290
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,460
I then heard a voice from the town

1291
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,120
Gently saying, follow me

1292
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,700
There's a problem down the valley

1293
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,280
There's a problem past the rain

1294
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:47,120
There's a problem in your sorrows

1295
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,180
When your mind is going insane

1296
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,940
There's a problem when you're burdened

1297
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,100
There's a problem where you're

1298
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,280
strained

1299
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,780
There's a problem

1300
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,040
Heavenly problem

1301
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,220
For kill me he did say

1302
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:17,800
The time my friends forsake me

1303
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,180
And I'm tempted to despair

1304
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,800
Then I summoned my dear Savior

1305
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,220
Short duration

1306
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,040
Amen

1307
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,340
I'm not here.

1308
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:41,960
You would pay to know exactly what it is you really do.

1309
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,140
You'd pay to know exactly what you really do.

1310
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,240
And I'll guarantee you my proper.

1311
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,020
You are probably a saint.

1312
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,620
And there's a frog farm down the valley.

1313
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:03,200
There's a frog farm that's the rain.

1314
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,040
There's a frog farm in your sorrows.

1315
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:13,260
When your mind is going insane.

1316
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,200
There's a frog farm when you're burdened.

1317
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,600
There's a frog farm where you stray.

1318
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,480
There's a frog farm.

1319
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,180
Heavenly.

1320
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,020
There's a frog farm.

1321
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,800
I hope you'll make it insane.

1322
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,940
Yeah!

1323
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,540
Yeah!

1324
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,720
Yes!

1325
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,660
Frog farms for everyone!

1326
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,420
Frog farms for Ella, my friend.

1327
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,380
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1328
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,600
Hour of Sloth.

1329
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,080
We're back!

1330
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:15,220
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1331
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:21,380
or see www.subgenius.com

1332
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,540
Praise Bob!

1333
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:34,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm on the alert for heterosexual killings.

1334
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,600
The State Department is closed Sunday.

1335
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,420
The State Department is possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.

1336
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,960
It continues to plot attacks for the entire month of August.

1337
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,340
This weekend, the U.S. is also closing all facilities, including PR News in Washington.

1338
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:57,700
Secretary of State Same-Sex Kerry says the U.S. will begin processing sexual PR News in Washington.

1339
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:04,180
The economy added 162 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 7,000.4%.

1340
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:09,640
Wall Street 13 authorities now say you're listening to PR News in Washington.

1341
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,680
The Department of Justice called the decision involuntary and says PR is, quote, a sham.

1342
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,900
James Whitey Bulger will not be taking PR News in Washington.

1343
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:28,600
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us.

1344
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,780
Keep on going for another couple of months.

1345
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,820
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1346
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,920
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1347
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:50,440
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1348
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,740
and help out financially as best you can.

1349
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,120
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1350
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,740
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1351
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,760
But some of you still have jobs.

1352
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:11,600
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1353
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,020
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1354
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:22,780
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1355
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,600
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.com.

1356
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:40,740
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1357
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,940
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
