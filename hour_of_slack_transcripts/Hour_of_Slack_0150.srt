1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,760
Oh, I hate to take you out of that one,

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,900
but we've got things we have to do and say, dear friends.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,700
This is the number one thing to say.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,940
This is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,380
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,660
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,620
which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,420
The subgenius.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,140
Our house.

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,940
Watch.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,200
Welcome to Temple.

12
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:31,900
Welcome to Temple.

13
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,540
Oh, yes, dear friends.

14
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,560
Welcome to Hour of Slack, number 150.

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,340
Yeah, we've done 150 of these shows now,

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,120
and to celebrate, I'm not going to talk.

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm not going to say a word, except on tape, a lot of that.

18
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,340
But at the same time, this is going to be another one of those introductory shows

19
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,680
where you can tape this and play it to your friends,

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,880
and relatives, and they won't think you're as crazy

21
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,000
as if you played them last week's show or next week's show.

22
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,920
Some...

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,880
I get interviewed by people out of town and out of time

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,640
if they're not out of town.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,220
So we're going to play some old interview tapes

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,640
and a lot of music, a lot of new subgenius music,

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,100
Bob songs, and you'll find out just what this is all about, won't you?

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
In the meantime,

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,920
you can call for information.

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,240
Call the Will Adobes.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
He's still here at...

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,920
Insert local number here.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
If you must.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,420
This music in the background is Danny Elfman's score for Beetlejuice.

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,420
My favorite movie music.

36
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,680
My favorite movie music.

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,680


38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm a composer now, I think.

39
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,400
And now we go from the Supreme Court to a different form of court.

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,360
This court you might call the Church of the Subgenius.

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,180
You might ask yourself, what do you mean by Church of the Subgenius?

42
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,100
Well, we sent our own Bill Cates out to find out, and this is what he learned.

43
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Okay, we're here with the...

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,260
Reverend Ivan Stang, who is the...

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,740
Well, what would you call yourself in relation to this church?

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,140
I am the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius,

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,720
a mere servant of our guru and saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
Praise his sweet name.

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Now, for those of our listeners not familiar with just who the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs are,

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,100
could you briefly give us a capsule description?

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
Well, the Church...

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,180
The Church of the Subgenius is what you might call a disorganized religion,

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,360
or you might say a non-organization for non-joiners,

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,520
for people who wouldn't be caught dead joining anything.

55
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,900
It is a church, but it's a church for sinners, disbelievers, or people who believe anything.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,960
Mutants, misfits, you know, your class clowns, your blasphemers, and talk show hosts.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,520
And who is J.R. Bob Dobbs?

58
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,960
He's the...

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,200
The guru.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,400
Bob Dobbs is the...

61
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Technically, he's called the high E-pop.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,240
Actually, he's the very salesman of the gods, that man, if he is indeed a man,

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,660
who has come to keep the conspiracy of the normals from buying your slack away from you.

64
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,540
You see, preachers have to do more than just lay people,

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,080
and Bob Dobbs, I think, is here to bring...

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,440
Slack to the slackless.

67
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,880
And if you...

68
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
Friends, if you don't know what slack is, then it's probably too late.

69
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,380
You should probably just shut your radio off,

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,500
because you're going to find out how much you've been missing.

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,460
Okay, what is slack?

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,140
Well, if you have to ask, you'll never know.

73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,620
As the Hell's Angels once put it,

74
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,100
those who know don't say, and those who say don't know,

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,640
which leads me to wonder why they said it, actually.

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Slack is, well, to compare it to happiness.

77
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,380
Uh, slack makes happiness feel like having your eyes gouged out with a carrot peeler.

78
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,760
It makes the nirvana of the Buddha feel like being buried up to your neck in sand,

79
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,600
waiting for the ants to come and eat your face away.

80
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,960
Or maybe a lawnmower to come mow your head off, perhaps.

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,220
Sure, sure.

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,860
Hmm.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,020
I've got the recipe for a grandma face sandwich, if you ever need it.

84
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,560
Essentially, what we're doing...

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
To get serious here,

86
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,500
what we're essentially doing is we're...

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,720
The Church of the Subgenius is trying to tempt sinners away from the devil.

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,900
Now, what they do and where they go after that is up to them.

89
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,920
But Bob Dobbs is a mighty, mighty man.

90
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,100
Or God.

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,620
We're not sure which, and it doesn't really matter.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,260
And he operates out of his skyscraper headquarters in Dallas.

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,700
Texas, where I work, in the Bible Belt.

94
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,220
And what we're essentially doing through our magazines, our radio shows, the tapes we sell,

95
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,540
and our new videotape, we're trying to unbuckle the Bible Belt

96
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,560
and get them to sort of drop their pants and make them face their own private desires.

97
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,260
So, friends, if you could just open your heart and bend over,

98
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,220
because Bob's coming.

99
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,200
He's coming.

100
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,900
He's coming.

101
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,120
And he...

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,140
And he comes not...

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,520
He comes not to forgive your sins.

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,320
We leave that to better connected deities.

105
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,720
Bob Dobbs comes and comes again and again to justify your sins, my friends.

106
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,660
To excuse your sins.

107
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,580
To offer you that great excuse that I know you need, my brothers and sisters.

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,120
How can you tell?

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,780
Oh, there's no way to tell.

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
Because Bob's coming.

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,020
He's sneaking up on you.

112
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,100
Can't you hear him?

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,540
Can't you feel him?

114
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,960
Can't you feel him?

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
One, two, Bob's coming for you.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
And Bobby's here.

117
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,320
Jehovah one is Santa, new Messiah.

118
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,980
He's the one who grins and smokes the pipe.

119
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,840
For in a world of darkness...

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,860
of danger and despair.

121
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,600
We can go on smiling

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,960
because we know that Bob Dobbs

123
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,940
is always there.

124
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,760
And I know that Bob's on my side.

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,820
I know it as sure as I'm born.

126
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,500
He will make the proper deal

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,400
with the exes' whore.

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,020
Then we'll come to meet him

129
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,200
and we'll greet him

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,220
and rule forevermore.

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,820
Bob is my one true savior.

132
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,160
You can't keep all of the rest.

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,780
Looking at his smiling face

134
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,540
helps me when I'm depressed.

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
For the pinks, I sure feel sorry.

136
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,380
For tomorrow, they'll fry

137
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,840
with all the rest.

138
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,620
Bob has got no real brain

139
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,920
to speak of.

140
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,980
Though his luck has seen him

141
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,920
through the lack.

142
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,820
For all the geniuses

143
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,700
led us down the wrong track.

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
Least we know a subgenius

145
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,380
won't turn around

146
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,640
and stab us in the back.

147
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,100
The con thinks they have us suckered

148
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,220
but I know that that is a lie.

149
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,960
They're due for a big surprise

150
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,040
from demons from the sky.

151
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,660
Makes me so glad I wised up,

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,840
got it sized up.

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,840
Hell, I'm a lucky guy.

154
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,780
Bob brought me slack

155
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,660
and that's lots more

156
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,680
than I ever got from the con.

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,940
Though I know it's only

158
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,700
because of all those pills

159
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,420
he's on.

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,860
Heck, I know he ain't too clever

161
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,160
but whatever he says

162
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
I'll do or die.

163
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,940
There's a shining golden city

164
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,000
where the robots live

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,300
beneath the central sun's

166
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,240
eternal glare.

167
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,240
And when the saucers come

168
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,800
from space,

169
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,840
to massacre the human race,

170
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,180
I know that we'll find

171
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,560
peace and safety there.

172
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,660
Through the holes in the poles

173
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,680
we will flee.

174
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,920
Sailing down to the lovely

175
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,940
central sea.

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,260
Leaving torture, death, and madness

177
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,420
for a land of joy and gladness.

178
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,200
Within the hollow earth

179
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,300
we will be free.

180
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,620
In atomic-powered go-karts

181
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,440
we will roam the land

182
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,740
while the aliens

183
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,500
devour human slaves.

184
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,880
They'll squirm beneath

185
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,020
the master's boot

186
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,100
or roam in packs

187
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,940
in search of loot

188
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,060
while we will laugh

189
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,660
to think that we were saved.

190
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,720
Through the holes in the poles

191
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
we will flee.

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,860
Sailing down to the lovely

193
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,840
central sea.

194
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,020
Leaving torture, death, and madness

195
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,120
for a land of joy and gladness.

196
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,860
Within the hollow earth

197
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,900
we will be free.

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,240
We'll ride in flying submarines

199
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,940
through air and through the sea.

200
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,860
While the aliens destroy

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,080
the works of man.

202
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,100
When they leave our blasted world

203
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,520
at last we'll rise again

204
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,380
without a past to implement

205
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,200
our splendid master plan.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,340
Through the holes in the poles

207
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
we will flee.

208
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,520
Sailing down to the lovely

209
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,480
central sea.

210
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,620
Leaving torture, death, and madness

211
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,680
for a land of joy and gladness.

212
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,500
Within the hollow earth

213
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,600
we will be free.

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,920
Within the hollow earth

215
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,340
we will be free.

216
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
We will be free.

217
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,920
We will be free.

218
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,460
Oh yes dear friends.

219
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,400
Go ahead, try to change channels.

220
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,920
You can't do it, can ya?

221
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,820
Oh, Nan,

222
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,000
can I bite in the background?

223
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
Says you can't.

224
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,640
And, uh, those last two songs

225
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,140
you heard were, um,

226
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,540
the first one was by

227
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,320
Reverend Orton Nenslow.

228
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,680
Up in Boston.

229
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,520
Praise Reverend Nenslow.

230
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,300
No, actually, the first one

231
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,980
was by Ahmed Fishmonger.

232
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,440
The second one was by Orton Nenslow.

233
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,000
The very last thing you heard

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,780
was Orton.

235
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,340
Uh, Ahmed Fishmonger

236
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,560
there at the beginning doing

237
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,220
Uh, Bob

238
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,900
is my one true savior.

239
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,860
Uh, and isn't it true?

240
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm gonna go back to, um,

241
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,760
see here,

242
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,680
this is, uh,

243
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,120
that radio show was

244
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,660
Bleepo Abernathy

245
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,460
um,

246
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,160
pretending he didn't know me

247
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,120
doing an interview on

248
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
K-Rock, uh,

249
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
KRXS, I think it is

250
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,200
in New York.

251
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,220
The biggest station in New York City, how about that, huh?

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,220
And this was prime time.

253
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,240
This is what, this is how

254
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,600
we

255
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,060
take advantage of you.

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360
The listener, thank you.

257
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,420
You need my brothers and sisters.

258
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,540
How can you tell, um,

259
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,160
if you are a subgenius?

260
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,820
Well, the easiest way to tell

261
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,120
is by sending, uh,

262
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,140
$20 into the church of the

263
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,220
subgenius sacred post office

264
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,100
box for membership.

265
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,060
Uh, the other way to tell would be

266
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,560
if you're the kind of person who

267
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
uh, hates

268
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,540
most normals,

269
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,340
uh, we're looking for people

270
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,640
who love to hate.

271
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,760
That's what I might say.

272
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,400
Although most of us have to, uh,

273
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,340
maintain the illusion that we ourselves

274
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,300
are normal.

275
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,920
We're out to teach people how to exploit

276
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,520
their abnormality, to quit hiding it,

277
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,220
and to, to

278
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,720
actually learn how to make money off of it.

279
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
Now, money is not exactly

280
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,220
the same as slack, but, uh,

281
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,880
uh, slack

282
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,620
tends to come a little easier with money.

283
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,360
Now, I remember hearing

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,320
somewhere that the church of the subgenius

285
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
is actually the only church that

286
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,580
admits it's in it for the money and, and, uh,

287
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,520
in fact pays its taxes

288
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,260
without complaining.

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,980
Right. We are the world's first industrial church.

290
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,100
Bob does not believe that, uh,

291
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
the public should have to subsidize

292
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,240
religions they may not happen

293
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,340
to believe in, besides which

294
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,320
I doubt seriously if the IRS

295
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,300
would ever let us get away with claiming tax

296
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,320
exempt status. But, uh, those

297
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
things aren't, those worldly things

298
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,280
are not important here.

299
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
We're, we're discussing,

300
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,420
uh, we're discussing the fact

301
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,280
that people should get out there

302
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,160
and buy that Simon & Schuster

303
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,260
book of the subgenius.

304
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,240
Yes, my friends, the book

305
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,260
of the subgenius and its companion

306
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,380
volume, High Weirdness

307
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,420
by Mail. Now, what is that? No, you're not

308
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,240
supposed to do that. You

309
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
can't do that! Don't go

310
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,660
out there and do such a thing.

311
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm sorry, we're not, we're not supposed to get to

312
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,320
that part. But,

313
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,340
here's a word from the League

314
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,820
of Women Voters of Dallas.

315
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,780
This is a nation of people.

316
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,260
By the people and

317
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,220
for the

318
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,000
people,

319
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,120
they say. So

320
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,920
exercise your voting right

321
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,320
November 8th.

322
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Your vote is your voice.

323
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,160
The League of Women Voters says

324
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,380
let it be heard on election day

325
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,740
November 8th.

326
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,360
Because otherwise, what do you think's going to

327
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,840
happen? They

328
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,100
will come in.

329
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
They will take over.

330
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,100
And do you know who

331
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,280
they are, don't you? They're the ones

332
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,200
you don't like. They're

333
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,340
everyone you never cared

334
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,120
for in your whole

335
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,100
life. And they'll run this whole

336
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,380
country if you don't get out

337
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,120
and vote. I'm not going to say exactly

338
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,920
who they are because I think

339
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,900
you know, don't you?

340
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,420
Would you sing the neighbor's song when you're

341
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,960
with me now?

342
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
They're the early risers.

343
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,920
They bomb bombs and they don't aren't. I'm just

344
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,140
singing in the rain. Pungy sticks and bamboo

345
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,920
splinters work much better making things.

346
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,260
Give me lots of death and torture. Give me lots

347
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,200
of gore. We may have lost battle,

348
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
but we haven't lost war.

349
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,060
I am not a man

350
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,400
of violence. I don't want

351
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,980
to use my fist.

352
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
We can settle this.

353
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,140
We will be smart. Don't you think

354
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,080
that we should talk and try to work it out?

355
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
Cambodian girls are hip.

356
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,200
I like those violent faces. And Leo's

357
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,500
so oh so sexy. Tribute to the racists.

358
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,320
I'd trade them all today and

359
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,300
give up all my money if I could

360
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,000
just be home with my Vietnam

361
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,540
honey.

362
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,380
Odie and his crew took a ram into you

363
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,280
and set up ship to go to Hades.

364
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
Odie poured a drink offering for all

365
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,320
souls and prayed to the empty shells of

366
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,640
the dead, dead, dead, dead.

367
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,220
Hey there, that's a sporty jacket. Where'd you get that tie?

368
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,360
Are those shoes real alligator? Do you

369
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,240
like apple pie? So this is your

370
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,080
democracy. It's very, very pretty.

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,420
But I think I'll be going now. That's

372
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,720
the Saigon city. Where'd you put my brain

373
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,560
today? Am I dead or am I gay?

374
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,120
Where'd you put my brain, you fool?

375
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,600
Am I dead or am I cruel?

376
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,380
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

377
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,540
Dying in a rice field with a Tommy gun in hand.

378
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,480
Shoot the nasty Yankees who have

379
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,380
come to take our land. Hot costume

380
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,540
basic black up north. It's all the rage.

381
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,360
While that olive green draft wouldn't

382
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,620
make the fashion page.

383
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Yo, hippo.

384
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,420
Yo, hippo.

385
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,000
An evil army of

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,680
advisors.

387
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,260
Lakeworm got the early

388
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,040
devices.

389
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,280
They bomb bombs on Agent Orange. I'm just

390
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,200
hanging in the rain. Fungi sticks and

391
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
bamboo splendors, which might better make him faint.

392
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
So give me lots of death and torture. Give me lots

393
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,620
of gore. We may have lost the battle,

394
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,020
but we haven't lost the war.

395
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,620
V-5-0-4. A bomb for you

396
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,440
to go destroy. Be you alive or

397
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,340
be you dead, at least you tried to stop the

398
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,480
red menace from consuming good and taking

399
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,380
over the neighborhood. Won't you be

400
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,540
my neighbor? Won't you be my neighbor?

401
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,300
Comodian girls are hip. I really

402
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,400
like their smiling faces. And Mayos

403
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,300
girls are oh so sexy. Tribute to the

404
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,400
races. I'd trade them all today and I

405
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,360
would give up all my money. If I

406
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,220
could just be home now with my Vietnam

407
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,700
honey.

408
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,040
Where'd you put my brain today?

409
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
Am I dead or am I gay? Where'd you put

410
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,400
my brain last night? Am I black or am I

411
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,420
white? Won't you be my neighbor? Won't

412
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,260
you be my neighbor? You're hip,

413
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,320
so am I. We both eat ham and Swiss on

414
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,560
rye.

415
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,800
Oh, thanks to Janine, Reverend Janine

416
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,280
C for that one there. That was the

417
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,340
neighbor song by the Bloody Mannequin

418
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,960
Orchestra. I don't know where she finds

419
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,160
these things. A true subgenius. She

420
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,120
really looks around, I suppose. And you

421
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,580
can too if you call the station here.

422
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,360
Please do.

423
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,420
Hey, what's up?

424
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


425
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


426
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


427
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


428
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


429
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,420


430
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,320
Uh, yes, and we're going to go to another

431
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,220
radio interview from the old days. This

432
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,940
one had me, Reverend Ivan Stang, and

433
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,180
Pastor Buck Naked, the mighty Pastor

434
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,320
Buck Naked, and the sneaky G Gordon

435
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,780
Gordon. All three of us on Halloween

436
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,940
night about three years ago on a show

437
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,420
hosted by the New York Times. And

438
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,420


439
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,420


440
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,420


441
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,420


442
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,420


443
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,500
hosted by a lady named Karen Denard.

444
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,120
Thank you.

445
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,480
We should have slack, that we were

446
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,260
born with original slack,

447
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,240
but that there is a vast

448
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,720
and insidious conspiracy,

449
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,360
more insidious than most people ever

450
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
dream, trying to sap

451
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,560
away our slack.

452
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,280
And you know who that conspiracy is?

453
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
Oh, it's them normals.

454
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,820
That's right.

455
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,240
Yeah, it's a conspiracy.

456
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,180
It's a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

457
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,240
There's a...

458
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,300
It's a go-along conspiracy.

459
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,080
But have you ever... Do you know J.R. Bob

460
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,540
Dobbs?

461
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,420
The day I came to know...

462
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Yeah, that's real funny, Buck.

463
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
That's not exactly true, Buck.

464
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,800
It was bad security.

465
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,980
What happened? I don't know. Stang was standing

466
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,160
right there, and his buddies just

467
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,480
pow, right in the head.

468
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh my goodness. J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot

469
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,380
a year ago January in San Francisco.

470
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,260
Oh. And did you read

471
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,020
about it in the New York Times?

472
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,740
No. Did you hear about it on all things considered?

473
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,380
Was it in the Dallas Papers? No.

474
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,100
That proves a conspiracy. It wasn't even in the National

475
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,040
Inquirer, dear friends.

476
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:28,680
And...

477
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,460
Wasn't on Morning Edition either.

478
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,260
No, no. Bob Dobbs died, and

479
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,040
life went on. Oh yes,

480
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,860
the people

481
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,340
just kept going to work every

482
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,360
day, not thinking about what they were

483
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
doing it for. They don't have

484
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,420
slack. They don't realize what has

485
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,400
happened. It may be too late for a lot of people.

486
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,140
Did he appoint you as his heir

487
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,360
for the Church of the Subgenius? Was he

488
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,340
leading the Church of the Subgenius? Just so

489
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,860
I understand what

490
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,080
J.R. Bob Dobbs role was. Bob leads

491
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,500
Bob leads by

492
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,420
mistake. He became

493
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,120
the leader of this thing by mistake. He doesn't

494
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,060
consciously set out to do anything. He's

495
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,260
a lot of us think he's the world's

496
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,160
stupidest man, and yet he's so lucky.

497
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,420
He has attracted all this wealth.

498
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,380
And he sells. He became

499
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,360
a salesman, and he just

500
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,120
sells by pushing himself

501
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,200
which is the product. In other words, nobody cares

502
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,940
the piece of junk they leave with.

503
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,300
They only go in for

504
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,380
the treatment, which is Bob. I see.

505
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
G. Gordon Gordon? Well, I

506
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,420
just wanted to say that a lot

507
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,380
of people aren't even aware of the fact that Bob

508
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,700
is dead, and it's really presumptuous

509
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,240
to speak about an heir to Bob

510
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,660
at this particular time, because

511
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,160
Bob will be coming back.

512
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,280
Bob will come again. There's just

513
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,340
no two ways about it. When, we're not sure,

514
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,340
and exactly where he will show up,

515
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
but there is no heir to the church.

516
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,140
The Reverend Stang was selected by

517
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,700
J.R. Dobbs as the sacred scribe

518
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,460
and as the man to stand up

519
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,100
and take the heat when

520
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,160
Bob isn't there to answer for

521
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,340
any and everything. Now, I

522
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,380
understand that there are

523
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,440
some very illustrious

524
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,680
members of the Church of the Subgenius.

525
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,320
Somebody told me Todd Rundgren,

526
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,880
Pee-wee Herman.

527
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,320
Oh yes, as a matter of fact, those

528
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,340
people get our material,

529
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,440
but they don't send us money. Todd asked for us

530
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,060
to send him a bunch of stuff, and then

531
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,640
he never sent his twenty dollar subscription.

532
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,600
Because I called Todd, and he told me

533
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,580
he never heard of you guys. You did not.

534
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,640
I did so. And he didn't, uh-uh.

535
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,700
He didn't say that. Well, you call him up

536
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
and see what he tells you.

537
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,900
Well, I'm not going to argue over

538
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,660
rock stars. These are mere

539
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,780
rock stars. And Karen, you must

540
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,040
understand, there are those people

541
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,800
who will, even though they have used

542
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,820
Dobbs, or they think they've used him

543
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,200
at this particular time of their life,

544
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,380
to further their careers, to further

545
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,300
their wealth and their personal standing,

546
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,220
many people will not admit

547
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,440
that J.R. Bob Dobbs

548
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,380
is that one person that has tilted the luck

549
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,120
plane to enable them to achieve

550
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,320
these heights. Mm-hmm. You're talking

551
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,880
about the normals, of course. Well, yes.

552
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,360
Todd Rundgren may want people to think he did it

553
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
by sheer talent. Oh, I see. He may

554
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,260
at this point not want to let

555
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,140
on that early in his career Bob Dobbs

556
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,820
Bob Dobbs sold him a

557
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,340
wood nickel or something that somehow

558
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,740
tilted his

559
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,540
fate in the

560
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,320
direction it's gone. But we do have some

561
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,820
other people who acknowledge the

562
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,240
existence of Bob. Oh, yeah. If you want us to

563
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,460
name drop, we can name drop.

564
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,440
Let's say that you and your

565
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,380
family... Well, this is puzzling evidence.

566
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,140
The host and

567
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,820
the mixer for most of these shows.

568
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,500
Reminding you

569
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,480
appoint one member of your family...

570
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,600
This schizophrenic show

571
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,280
is for your benefit,

572
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,940
not ours.

573
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,300
Yes, you are

574
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,020
able to hear

575
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,860
such religions as

576
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,700
the subgenius church,

577
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,500
the saint stupid,

578
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,880
the discordians,

579
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,140
all those other

580
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,500
favorites that you ask about,

581
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,180
many of whom appear in the now

582
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,820
modern book

583
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,740
High Times by Weird Male,

584
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,180
and others who have

585
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,200
not yet been added to the

586
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,080
pantheon, and still others who

587
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,180
predate the subgenius by quite a lot.

588
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,580
But in any case,

589
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,220
if you whirl around the planet,

590
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,940
keep in mind,

591
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,360
that we love you.

592
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,880
Is this the end?

593
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,480
Is this the end of the show?

594
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,340
Okay, here we go.

595
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,020
Almost time for the news to come in.

596
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,980
Our space cadets

597
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,200
have just finished their nap.

598
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Space cadets have just

599
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,420
begun their role.

600
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
They've just begun the bagaing.

601
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
I have not yet begun

602
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,780
to fight.

603
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
I have never known

604
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,060
no man that has begun

605
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,300
so many times

606
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,980
to fight.

607
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,460
It's like I've never realized

608
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,960
how many times they started fighting.

609
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,780
And then it was over.

610
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,840
No man can realize the effect

611
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,380
of that same fight upon

612
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,120
the young brow.

613
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,780
And no man knows how large

614
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,960
these beasts make.

615
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,620
Is my microphone on?

616
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,400
I don't see any of it.

617
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,440
No, you're not with us any longer.

618
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,540
Because it's the end of the show.

619
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,160
Well, why don't we fill it up with merriment

620
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,260
and laughter?

621
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,740
El Casa de 8484425.

622
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,080
What is happening on the radio?

623
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:22,620
There's no sound.

624
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,340
Yeah, I don't hear anything,

625
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
so it makes me kind of wonder.

626
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,060
There's a little bit of something.

627
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,880
It makes me scared when I don't have

628
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,660
that psychological support

629
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,320
in those background sounds.

630
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,620
Well, put a little wow

631
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,060
in your life and turn it up

632
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,300
for you.

633
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
Look, there's a collar.

634
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,080
What's a collar doing at this hour?

635
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,080
The adolescent years can be more

636
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,660
than just a difficult phase that a child

637
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,600
is going through. They can be dangerous years

638
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,320
when many young people drink too much,

639
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,080
eat poorly, and even consider suicide.

640
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,360
The startling information was compiled

641
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
through a study of 11,000 8th and 10th graders

642
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,020
in 1987 from 217

643
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,280
public and private schools.

644
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,500
The study revealed a troubled teenage

645
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,020
population in which 42% of the girls

646
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,980
and 25% of the boys said they had

647
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,220
seriously considered suicide.

648
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,040
Surprising numbers said they had

649
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,680
smoked marijuana and even more

650
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,580
had had five or more drinks on one occasion

651
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,840
in the previous two weeks.

652
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,100
And while most teens understood how AIDS

653
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,520
is transmitted, a majority of those surveyed

654
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,040
thought that birth control pills prevented

655
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,440
transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases.

656
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,200
In fact, 2.5 million teens

657
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,260
contract STDs each year.

658
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,940
With all this in mind,

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
it's not surprising that the study found

660
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
that many teens either overindulge in fatty foods

661
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,340
and sugary snacks or use unsafe diets

662
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,880
such as fasting, diet pills,

663
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,680
and laxatives.

664
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,400
All of this together indicates that the problems

665
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,840
that adolescents in America are just as serious

666
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,160
as the problems facing adults,

667
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,900
and there are no easy answers or simple solutions.

668
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
I'm Laurie Johnson, and that's 60 Seconds.

669
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,300
Roger Dodger, all you true subgenius fans out there.

670
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,420
Now I hope you have your membership books

671
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,880
and your special Boeing cards

672
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,420
and your secret ring.

673
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,600
Then we have got your secret ring

674
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,720
when you look inside and you see your wowie picture

675
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,300
that you're not supposed to let any of your women folks see.

676
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,980
Now we're going to tell you how to get this swell watch

677
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,340
and this beautiful ring in about 25 minutes

678
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,680
if you keep listening to our program.

679
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,480
Ah, there was the first Boeing of the season.

680
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,240
Ouch!

681
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,700
Waited by me on unamplified mode.

682
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,980
But when...

683
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,480
As we wander through this charnel house,

684
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,040
this abattoir we call life,

685
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,120
specifically how it is organized

686
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
and how you should use it,

687
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,740
with this information,

688
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,020
you will be better prepared to...

689
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,760
Can I get a witness?

690
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,140
Can I get a witness?

691
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,260
Help me somebody.

692
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Can I get a witness?

693
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,560
Now, we've covered some of the most obvious

694
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,200
aisles of hate,

695
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,600
but what about some of the

696
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,500
less apparent?

697
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,780
What about the liberals, you might ask?

698
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,880
Do the subjugates also hate the liberals?

699
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,760
Friends, we hate anyone

700
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,400
who doesn't try to completely

701
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,800
and utterly destroy us.

702
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,180
Now you might ask,

703
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,840
what about what's left?

704
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,180
What we sometimes half-jokingly refer to as

705
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,580
the liberal party?

706
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:45,580


707
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,500
The cattle.

708
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,980
What about it?

709
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,000
Labor!

710
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,220
But contrary to popular belief,

711
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,800
the cattle aren't

712
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,580
entirely useless.

713
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,660
They shall have several uses

714
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,380
after 1998.

715
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,660
They can be used

716
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,240
as a cheap source of labor.

717
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,720
They can be taxed.

718
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,180
Kept in the home as pets.

719
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,580
They can be used

720
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:15,580


721
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:15,860
as a toy.

722
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,020
Or upon a whim,

723
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,540
they might be unleashed and well,

724
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
hunted for sport.

725
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,440
Can I get a witness?

726
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,560
You know, I went over to my friend Rick Maverick's

727
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,400
house the other day,

728
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,220
and I was feeling kind of down in the dumps.

729
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,880
I was kind of depressed that day.

730
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,280
He took me out in his backyard

731
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,460
and he showed me something that just

732
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
kind of raised my spirits.

733
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,100
And it was just kind of neat

734
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,660
that he could do something like that.

735
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,500
It kind of filled me with a sense of warmth.

736
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,740
He had,

737
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,240
out in his backyard,

738
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,820
he had just spelled out,

739
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,540
have a nice day

740
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,920
in the skulls of normals

741
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,100
he had decapitated.

742
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,720
And I just said,

743
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
that's neat.

744
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,080
That's kind of neat.

745
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,180
Mrs. Robinson and I took

746
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,080
the local subgenius clinch Sunday school class

747
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,920
on a field trip last Sunday

748
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,300
to one of these normal neighborhoods

749
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,980
and let me tell you,

750
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,780
it's every bit as bad as the pamphlet makes it out,

751
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,100
okay?

752
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,060
Now, I'm not prejudiced or anything like that.

753
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,540
A lot of my best friends are normals.

754
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,940
I just think as long as they know their place.

755
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,420
Well, they reproduce like animals.

756
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,880
Well, they reproduce like animals.

757
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,220
We're thinking about moving soon.

758
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,120
We're thinking about moving soon.

759
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,820
Maybe even off-planet.

760
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,080
The cattle, ladies and gentlemen.

761
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,560
Now, what we're thinking about

762
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,080
is what is the next theory

763
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,780
of the Church of the Subgenius

764
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,160
I'm going to discuss tonight?

765
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,780
The next theory is always more hate.

766
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,080
Hatar!

767
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
I love it.

768
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,960
We're looking for people who love to hate.

769
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,400
You know?

770
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
That was Jayner Hyperkleets

771
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,280
live at the

772
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,320
New Orleans

773
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,240
World Science Fiction Convention

774
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,500
about a month ago.

775
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,500
Prior to that, you heard

776
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,320
a couple of clips from the

777
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,560
KPFA Subgenius

778
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,380
show in Berkeley.

779
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,140
Puzzling Evidence, Hal Robbins,

780
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,500
Philo Drummond in this case,

781
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,740
Mobius Rex,

782
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,700
and Gearing a Broke Friend.

783
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,240
Oh, yes.

784
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,920
And, uh,

785
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,020
well, you know,

786
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,780
uh,

787
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,060
I guess I ought to go back to the

788
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,080
to the talk shows,

789
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,940
the talk show radio things,

790
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,200
so that I can then make a smooth transition

791
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,120
to the ironic, um,

792
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
pardon me,

793
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,380
Diet Coke there,

794
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,040
the ironic, uh,

795
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,360
Eberle Brothers tune,

796
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,000
Jesus in a Red Dress,

797
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,920
or something like that.

798
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,820
So, here we go.

799
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
I'll bless you.

800
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,260
And, uh,

801
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:16,980
oh,

802
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,000
Mark Mothersbaugh of, uh,

803
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,100
Devo, uh,

804
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,680
Devo, okay.

805
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,600
Now, we could,

806
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,780
we could name some rock stars

807
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,140
that are in town right now,

808
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,480
but I,

809
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,740
we're just not too sure anymore.

810
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,920
Okay. Gee, go on, go on.

811
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,900
It's clear to me, uh, Reverend Stang,

812
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,700
you know, when you say Reverend Stang,

813
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,000
and when you say Pastor Naked,

814
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,220
uh, that conjures up, you know,

815
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,460
an idea of what that is.

816
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,720
Now, G. Gordon Gordon,

817
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,340
you need to, uh, clue me in as to

818
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,360
what role you play in the church.

819
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,680
Well, officially, I'm the,

820
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,560
I am the mercenary of mercy,

821
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,660
and I'm sort of a hit man for Bob.

822
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,340
And, uh, I...

823
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,500
We say this to ensure disbelief.

824
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,420
Yes. And, uh, we, we don't mind admitting it,

825
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,460
because just like the CIA and everything else

826
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,060
in the conspiracy, if you admit it,

827
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,400
everybody doesn't believe it and thinks it's a big joke.

828
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,220
But there are certain things that require work

829
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,360
of a quasi-legal

830
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,740
nature that, that Bob,

831
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,640
Bob has to have done for him.

832
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,240
As an example? Well, certain people have to be

833
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,300
removed in certain places. Security has

834
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,720
to be maintained in other places.

835
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,420
Computer files have to be emptied.

836
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,940
Sometimes we have to change their minds,

837
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,400
so to speak. So you have your coat on

838
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
for what reason now? So you can,

839
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,720
so your weapons don't show?

840
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,360
No, actually, it's cold in this studio, so I thought that, uh,

841
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,260
normally, yes, normally, uh,

842
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,400
but we, this being Dallas,

843
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,580
uh, people frown on you carrying guns.

844
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,300
Malaysia, it's no problem. Unless you're

845
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,740
got presidents in the, in the

846
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,780
sites, then you're okay.

847
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,240
Okay. Uh, Reverend Naked,

848
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,960
uh, Pastor Naked, forgive me,

849
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,400
um, tell me what

850
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,460
you think the appeal of this church

851
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,520
is. I mean, since you say it's

852
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,280
different from what we know

853
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,440
as, as the church. I think that just like

854
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,380
any cult, when you're starting out, you have to

855
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,520
promise something for free, you know,

856
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,360
free money, free love, you know,

857
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,460
something for nothing, and we do that

858
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,400
more than, more than I think other cults

859
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,380
are right now. And what we're

860
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,600
offering is value, as I'm ranting to you,

861
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


862
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


863
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


864
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


865
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


866
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


867
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


868
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,600


869
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
Well, just by, just by,

870
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,740
just by that, right. Just by the-

871
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,440
just by the- the doctrine of, of total

872
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,860
slack, and the, uh, approach to

873
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,800
slack, uh, you know,

874
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,240
what is slack? A lot of, a lot of if I'm

875
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,040
asking, well, it's, it's getting money for not

876
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:50,160
98 at 7 a.m., and all the subgeniuses will be ruptured up into the pleasure dimension for eternity,

877
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,720
or depending on how much money they've spent on the church.

878
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,160
Uh-huh.

879
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,280
And those who sat around and said, oh, well, I'll...

880
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

881
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,960
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

882
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,040
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

883
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,200
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

884
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,160
Stick needles in my belly, take samples of my skin.

885
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,860
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

886
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,860
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

887
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:44,820
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

888
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,620
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

889
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,240
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

890
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

891
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,940
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

892
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,940
Hey, commutators, let me join your crew.

893
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,860
Let me Pناu can pas vez pas.

894
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


895
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,860


896
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:04,960
Give Pnau, a little touch of the water in your punch.

897
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:04,960


898
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,620
Me and I, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

899
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,340
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face.

900
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,820
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

901
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
Oh, take me off to space.

902
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
Take me off to space.

903
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,460
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

904
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,000
Take me off to space.

905
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,140
Take me off to space.

906
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,860
Take me off to space.

907
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,100
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

908
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,660
Come down, you tiny robot with your little nipper claws.

909
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,440
You pale and bug-eyed alien with white and clammy paws.

910
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace.

911
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,780
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

912
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,240
Oh, take me off to space.

913
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,220
Take me off to space.

914
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,980
Come on down.

915
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,020
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

916
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,140
Take me off to space.

917
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,460
Take me off to space.

918
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,120
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

919
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,980
Oh, friends, boy, if you only knew what an all-star lineup that was doing that song just then.

920
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,460
That was the song by Orton Neslow, known by other names, which you'll hear.

921
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,100
Katie V.

922
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,640
You'll see.

923
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,740
Ahmed Fishmonger on background vocals and Donna Cossey and Pagan Kennedy.

924
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,900
Oh, yes.

925
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,780
Great subgeniuses up there in shadowed Arkham, Massachusetts.

926
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,300
Oh, yes, indeedy.

927
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,820
And said, oh, well, I'll buy that $1 pamphlet about Bob.

928
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,100
Or I'll have Bob tattooed on my head, but I'm not going to send in that $20 for those magazines.

929
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,260
And those people will fry.

930
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,060
They shall fry along with the helpless pink.

931
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,180
And mediocritans who compose most of what they call humanity.

932
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,720
Helpless pinks.

933
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,840
And also, Pastor Naked, you were going to say something?

934
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,520
Well, I'll say goodbye.

935
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,420
I'd like to say...

936
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,840
I'd like to say...

937
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,560
Mother had on high heels a red dress for Jesus.

938
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,580
I'll pour that on the town.

939
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:48,840
Well, she did her best to outdress the rest who found their way downtown.

940
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,160
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

941
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,120
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

942
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,160
Saint Peter said.

943
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,560
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

944
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,800
God made her that way.

945
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,220
Mother had on high heels a red dress for Jesus.

946
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,380
Dressed for a night on the town.

947
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,240
She was as pure as Mary Magdalene.

948
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,640
She sure could throw it down.

949
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,960
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

950
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,920
What will Saint Peter say?

951
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,100
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

952
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,100


953
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,580
God made her that way.

954
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven.

955
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,540
What will St. Peter say

956
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,060
Oh Lord, let her look that good in heaven

957
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,400
God made her that way

958
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:21,080
God made her that way

959
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,880
God made her that way

960
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,460
God made her that way

961
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,920
It's the winning side

962
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,380
And everyone is cheering for the winning side

963
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,720
And the children leave their homes to join the winning side

964
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,860
And when Jesus comes

965
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,320
He'll march on with the king

966
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,460
And we've got all the right answers

967
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,020
In the guiding light

968
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,240
When we're on the right

969
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,420
And we have no fear

970
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,560
No, we have no fear

971
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,820
Waiting for the signs

972
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,360
We will give our lives

973
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,460
We will give our lives

974
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,280
And I feel so awesome

975
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,600
And it's so lonely

976
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,020
To feel that night

977
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,520
To almost feel you near me

978
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,720
I imagine that you're with me

979
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,760
On the winning side

980
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,780
We don't ask too many questions

981
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,100
On the winning side

982
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,060
And I've got this strange sensation

983
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,500
On the winning side

984
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,820
I don't recognize the faces

985
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,260
Of the people I love

986
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,040
On the winning side

987
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,080
And we all live here in cages

988
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,020
Someone cried last night

989
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,300
And it made a sound

990
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,460
With my eyes closed tight

991
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,840
I hear everything

992
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,820
I can hear your voice

993
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,820
When I kiss the ground

994
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,100
When I kiss the ground

995
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,260
And the lights go out

996
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,260


997
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,260


998
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,260


999
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,260


1000
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,260


1001
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,620
You know you better

1002
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,880
And I'd like to know your name

1003
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,060
I could really show you something

1004
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,100
If you give me half a chance

1005
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,600
Cause I'm on the winning side

1006
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:36,940
Yeah

1007
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
Yeah

1008
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
Yeah

1009
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,700
Yeah

1010
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,820
Yeah

1011
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah

1012
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Yeah

1013
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:48,640
Yeah

1014
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah

1015
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,320


1016
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,820
Yeah

1017
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1018
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1019
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:49,820


1020
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,420
Yeah

1021
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,900
Yeah

1022
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:51,920
Yeah

1023
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:51,940
Yeah

1024
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,240
Yeah

1025
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,240


1026
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,280
Yeah

1027
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,900
Yeah

1028
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,480
Yeah

1029
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,140
Yeah

1030
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,100
Yeah

1031
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,420
On the winning side

1032
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,420
You're with me

1033
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,740
On the winning side

1034
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,560
Thank you

1035
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:06,940
Foratti

1036
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,320
Foratti

1037
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,480
Thank you

1038
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,520
Too bad

1039
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,780
I am fraud

1040
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,300
I am fraud

1041
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,620
To be

1042
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,600
Be

1043
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,240
A fighter

1044
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,480
I'd like to take you somewhere that you've never been before

1045
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,280
And I feel so isolated

1046
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,700
And I feel so all alone

1047
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,940
Here on the inside

1048
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,140
And I feel so all alone

1049
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,420
Here on the inside

1050
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,460
And I feel so all alone

1051
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,740
Here on the inside

1052
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,920
And I feel so all alone

1053
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,020
Here on the inside

1054
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,320
And I feel so all alone

1055
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,860
Yeah, on the inside

1056
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,520
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, Mr. City.

1057
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,740
Yeah.

1058
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,060
Mr. City, hey.

1059
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,500
Oh, thanks, thanks.

1060
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah.

1061
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,600
Sure is nice to...

1062
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,740
to be here

1063
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,020
in the city

1064
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,440
where the rate of everything is going up.

1065
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,260
Yeah, especially crime.

1066
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,080
Yeah, the property taxes.

1067
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,620
The high-rise building.

1068
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,140
Yeah, but mostly crime.

1069
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,400
And, uh, yeah.

1070
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,320
Crime.

1071
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,940
Yeah.

1072
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,300
Especially crime that's on the rise.

1073
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,840
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

1074
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,320
But, uh, you'll be glad to know that Mr. City is working it out so that for every crook,

1075
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,280
there's a cop.

1076
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,880
That's that boy!

1077
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,980
You know, of course, where, uh, crime begins.

1078
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,860
Well, why don't you sing about it some, huh?

1079
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,940
Okay, I...

1080
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,760
I will.

1081
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,420
Yeah.

1082
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:18,720
Yeah.

1083
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1084
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1085
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1086
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1087
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1088
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1089
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1090
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1091
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1092
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1093
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1094
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1095
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1096
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1097
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:48,720


1098
00:48:48,720 --> 00:49:18,720


1099
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720


1100
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,080
It all happens in gardens.

1101
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,860
Oh, by the way, you don't mind if I eat this?

1102
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,940
The apple.

1103
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,760
Yes, sure is a crime.

1104
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,740
I don't have more time.

1105
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,540
Apple.

1106
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,180
Yeah.

1107
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,300
Sure is a crime.

1108
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,640
Sure is a crime.

1109
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,980
You don't have more time.

1110
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,120
The apple.

1111
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,040
We don't have more time.

1112
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,920
Sure is a crime.

1113
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,020
We're gonna put you away.

1114
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,380
Throw away.

1115
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,600
Sure is a crime.

1116
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,620
Sure is a crime.

1117
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,540
Like I said.

1118
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,280
And we don't have more time.

1119
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,720
Sure is a crime.

1120
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,420
We don't have more time.

1121
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,100
Sure is a crime.

1122
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,720
Yeah.

1123
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,860
We don't have more time.

1124
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,020
Last time I saw you.

1125
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,500
I saw the judge.

1126
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,800
I asked him what he meant when he'd say judge not.

1127
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,580
He got so mad.

1128
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,560
The judge did.

1129
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,740
Sure is a crime.

1130
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,220
He went into solitary.

1131
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,800
Had to do it.

1132
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,560
We don't have more time.

1133
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,300
People in glass houses and all that sort of thing.

1134
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,240
More crime.

1135
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,820
It's a crime.

1136
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,900
We don't have more time, friends.

1137
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,020
That was Ken Nordean from the Texas News.

1138
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1139
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1140
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1141
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1142
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1143
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1144
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1145
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1146
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1147
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1148
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1149
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1150
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1151
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,020


1152
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:54,400
We're gonna do a five minute live tape triple talk which you can get from Snail Records at 6106 North Kenmore Avenue in Chicago.

1153
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,820
60660.

1154
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,020
Oh, and this is Mondo Logic?

1155
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,960
Ha ha ha.

1156
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,200
Fine.

1157
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,640
All right.

1158
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,540
All right.

1159
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,900
All right.

1160
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,440
I'd like to say something.

1161
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,100
Yes, you're good.

1162
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:42,500
You're good.

1163
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:51,720
One of the reasons I think that the church is one of the fastest growing cults in the planet, I would probably estimate, is that every...

1164
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,660
Now, you just came from Brazil, did you tell me?

1165
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:53,880
Yes, yes.

1166
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,660
And there was the Church of the Sub-Jesus there?

1167
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,640
Oh, I am the Pope of Brazil.

1168
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,380
Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere.

1169
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:58,840
Okay.

1170
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,780
And that we're not putting you on.

1171
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,240
Okay.

1172
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,500
I mean, none of this, everything we've said so far is true.

1173
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,180
But more by what you would call true.

1174
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,560
True.

1175
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,760
But one of the reasons...

1176
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:16,020
Because the church accommodates anything in a person's belief system into our dogma.

1177
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,820
Anything the subgenius spouts becomes instantly part of our church dogma.

1178
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,720
Yeah, you can believe, unlike most religions, you can believe anything you want in this religion.

1179
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,020
That's right.

1180
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
We believe in everything.

1181
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,860
Okay.

1182
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,100
Now, you were making a point.

1183
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,560
You go ahead and go.

1184
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:26,780
Well, I think...

1185
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,000
One of the points is that the reason why the Church of the Subgenius is so popular is because

1186
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,920
most religions of every persuasion of the...

1187
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,480
We call them the false churches.

1188
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:43,500
...require a great deal of hard personal work, concentration, studying, deprivation.

1189
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,340
The Church of the Subgenius does not require you to give up anything in your diet.

1190
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,760
They do not require you to give up any of those vices that many other religions require you to...

1191
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,160
We're trying to find new ones.

1192
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,360
Now, that's exactly right.

1193
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,420
And we don't...

1194
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,720
We know that people don't have...

1195
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,460
We don't have time to spend 17 years on a mountaintop meditating.

1196
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,300
Is your work the work of the devil?

1197
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,080
Let's lay it out right on the table right now in here.

1198
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:04,400
Heck no.

1199
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,560
As a matter of...

1200
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:05,740
Heavens no.

1201
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:15,220
I wonder about that every now and then, but never for very long, because the devil doesn't operate that way.

1202
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,000
We're way too open for the devil.

1203
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,440
Basically, the devil has no sense of humor.

1204
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,480
You know, if the devil is as tricky as he is...

1205
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,820
There you go.

1206
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,220
...then, you know, who would he be imitating?

1207
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,040
He sure wouldn't be imitating...

1208
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,580
Imitating Bob.

1209
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:26,980
Bob, us.

1210
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,600
I mean, what would that get him?

1211
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,140
You're going to find the devil in church.

1212
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,500
Mm-hmm.

1213
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,880
But not our church.

1214
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,620
Okay.

1215
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,700
Now, there's...

1216
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,060
Stuff.

1217
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,380
Now, now, I'm...

1218
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,700
You think you saw a monster, but the human mind often plays strange tricks.

1219
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,760
Like this one.

1220
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,900
I won't do that again.

1221
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,720
It's too hard.

1222
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,260
Okay, it's too hard, he says.

1223
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,760
We're backing down the show...

1224
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,220
It's a rock.

1225
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1226
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,140
You gotta do this.

1227
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,280
Then, scratch it!

1228
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:04,700
Ahh ah ha...

1229
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,920
Logic control fails...

1230
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,740
I hermane ero J.

1231
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,040
A submission way myself.

1232
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,740
Africa's since история,

1233
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,900
but it might make him a fan

1234
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,000
It might have some business points.

1235
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,120
I mean, it's Yeah, but some sorts or something.

1236
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,120


1237
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,120


1238
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,740
this on TV, It's this.

1239
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:15,740


1240
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,660
part of the thing.

1241
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,520
So miss not until we're ready, then you can enter a home.

1242
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,440
band of Myers about in Virginia 아버.

1243
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,620
I see on us during that minute really does. reach out.

1244
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,300
We'll get control of the show back any minute now.

1245
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,820
Something ought to be done about these boys.

1246
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,640
Because they don't take Jesus into their heart.

1247
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,960
That's true. That's ever so true, friend.

1248
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,440
You mustn't be like these wicked men.

1249
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,380
Don't do it.

1250
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:03,400
The Bible says that he who broadcasts late at night or early in the morning

1251
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,240
shall bring upon his heart the abomination of desolation.

1252
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,680
And Jesus said we should always stick by our God

1253
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,000
and do what we think is right, whatever the other fellow says.

1254
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,420
That's the truth, friends.

1255
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,680
And you can get some more of that abomination and desolation

1256
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,360
by writing Bob at...

1257
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,060
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1258
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,700
75214.

1259
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,160
Once again, free information.

1260
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,120
You'll find out.

1261
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,220
Just try. Go ahead. Try us.

1262
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,960
Box140306, Dallas.

1263
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:46,800
75214.

1264
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,200
Just address that to Bob.

1265
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,000
And stay tuned for Robert...

1266
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,720
Wisdom.

1267
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,280
Zzzz.

1268
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,500
...American Music Party.

1269
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,920
Friends of audience elimination,

1270
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,600
if you leave here alive,

1271
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,160
if you're good enough to survive the training in Dobstown,

1272
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,400
if you can take that fishhook bone member down your throat

1273
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,620
and tickle that bat just right,

1274
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,140
extract it without hurting the bat or yourself...

1275
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,360
Then you can sit through all of this.

1276
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,580
Then you will no longer be maggots.

1277
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,100
You will no longer be pukes.

1278
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,120
You will be full-fledged subgeniuses,

1279
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,180
and you will be weapons.

1280
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,960
Weapons for Bob.

1281
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,200
Praying for slack.

1282
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,580
Okay, who next?

1284
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,280
Any questions?

1285
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,760
Any other authors out there?

1286
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,340
Um...

1287
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,600
In disguise?

1288
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah, you never know.

1289
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,180
So...

1290
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,060
So what the hell are we doing on the panel?

1291
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:47,660
No care, sir.

1292
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,140
So what is...

1293
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,320
So what is Three Fists of Tales of Bob?

1294
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,600
What is this, Three Fists of Tales of Bob?

1295
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,800
Well, Three Fists of Tales of Bob, unlike the book of the subgenius,

1296
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,980
is actually a book of...

1297
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,280
fiction.

1298
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,440
Or partly fiction.

1299
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,960
Uh, some of it is...

1300
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,080
You don't think it's fiction?

1301
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,140
It's a book of metaphor!

1302
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,180
A book of...

1303
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,840
A parable!

1304
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,460
A book of...

1305
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:03,920
Literature!

1306
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:04,820
Huh?

1307
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,000
We thought it was an instruction manual for de-beaking the squid.

1308
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,560
That's not even fiction, Doug.

1309
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,180
Well, it was originally, friends.

1310
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,200
Ah, God.

1311
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,860
We'll get back to that next week.

1312
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,660
That's a little panel discussion from...

1313
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,500
that New Orleans, uh, science fiction convention.

1314
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,800
With, uh...

1315
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,820
I don't know who was on that.

1316
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,400
Pope David N. Meyer, Nancy Regalia, John Shirley.

1317
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,160
Jane or Hypercliques.

1318
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,380
Books... Brooks Carruthers.

1319
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,560
Sternodocs Keckhaver.

1320
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,720
And Willa Dobbs.

1321
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,540
So, uh...

1322
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,140
Yeah.

1323
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:35,980
I couldn't see.

1324
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:36,920
There we go.

1325
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:37,800
And I...

1326
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,020
Wait a minute.

1327
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
I can't see it.

1328
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,860
No, no.

1329
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,820
I couldn't see it either.

1330
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,600
We have to get it down on the bottom deck so that Robert can take over with his tape.

1331
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,520
See, it's okay.

1332
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:45,940
There we go.

1333
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,540
There we go.

1334
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:46,820
And I...

1335
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,460
There we go.

1336
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,220
I thought I looked down and I saw my own body.

1337
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,460
We have to put it back together ourselves.

1338
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,420
Yeah, might as well.

1339
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,760
And I do that all the time.

1340
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,740
You remove the watch.

1341
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,320
No, you just look down.

1342
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:55,960
You see your eyes.

1343
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,060
Your arms.

1344
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,500
Your legs.

1345
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,300
Whatever, you know.

1346
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:57,580
Do you?

1347
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,000
Do you have mirrors on your seat?

1348
00:58:59,120 --> 00:58:59,560
Your original.

1349
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,020
Goodbye.

1350
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,100
I don't need them.

1351
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,020
I can see my own body wherever I am.

1352
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,080
It's a power that I've possessed since birth.

1353
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,340
Created.

1354
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,880
I simply look down along my own axis and I see all the parts of my body except...

1355
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,800
...the parts of your body.

1356
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:13,900
Radio.

1357
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,760
Then you can't see the inside of your own eye?

1358
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,640
Of course not.

1359
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,500
Don't press that button.

1360
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,820
Oh, don't use that button.

1361
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,420
That's on show.

1362
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,160
Reluctance.

1363
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,320
It's only on one side.

1364
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,520
Randomize the show.

1365
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,600
What about the aerobic report?

1366
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,260
Delayed from the subgenius world of physical fitness.

1367
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,000
Shut up, door.

1368
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,620
Today on...
