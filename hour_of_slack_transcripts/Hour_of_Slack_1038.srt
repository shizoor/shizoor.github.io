1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm paid in wages and benefits.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,440
I'm broke.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,960
Coretta Scott King shot and killed six civilian workers at a mall in California today.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,480
How many must die?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,740
King founded the Center for Violent Social Change on Wall Street for 1085-8259.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,740
This is PR News.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,440
PR News.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,100
PR News.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,560
The new PR Compensation Index rose 3.1% last year.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
That year saw a gain of 3.7, PR News.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,020
Welcome to the joy-free realm of Quadrant 9.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,640
Please line up and do as you're told for the next 90 years.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,740
We do ask that you try to die before you're 100 years old so it's not convenient for the new members.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,160
Please stare into this painted window.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,980
Until tomorrow.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Until you're dead.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,100
I mean, until you're happy.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,000
Which in this case will probably be the same time.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,080
Thank you for coming to Quadrant 9.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,280
Sorry, what was it you said?

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Prepare to activate.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,580
Don't touch it!

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,580
It's the history eraser button, you fool!

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,960
The

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,520
sound of a train.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,420
But it's far, far away.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,440
Behind the moon.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,580
Beyond the rain.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,660
Somewhere over the sun.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,880
The sun's genius.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:01:59,980
The sun's genius.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,840
Power of...

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
...work.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,380
I guess it doesn't really matter.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Talk, talk, talk, talk.

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,820
Doctors.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,520
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,560
All in the name of increasing talk.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,340
Join Bob.

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,120
My name is Bob.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,860
That's right.

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,660
Anyway, trying to get somebody excited.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,920
Basically, I wrote an article on my butt.

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,240
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,600
But basically, the, uh, the, uh, these...

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,100
They give these, these...

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,380
They give these gobbledygook...

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,700
Yeah, and then, and then I...

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,060
Your steak.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
And then, and then I...

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,820
And then, and then I...

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,160
Your steak.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,260
And then, and then I...

58
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,180
Somebody could figure out how to put a fart on a screen.

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,540
Psychogenic consumerism...

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,240
Double speak.

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,980
Yeah, basically...

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,140
You turned over your janitorial duties?

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,080
Yes, yes, to your wife, actually.

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,760
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

66
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,980
No, no.

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm just...

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,540
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

69
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,680
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

71
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,780
And, I was, I was just, you know...

72
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,780


73
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,780


74
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,440
And they're on the other side of the planet, so you know they have to have Chapman.

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,900
So, you know they have to have Chapman.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,640
Did I break your concentration?

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
For two weeks.

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,360
Exactly.

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,380
But, uh...

81
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,140
For two weeks.

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,100
Exactly.

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
But, uh, but, uh, but, uh...

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,700
There's an issue with 911.

85
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,560
Yeah.

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,040
Yeah.

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Reloaded hermaphrodite forms dance like candies through the planet itself.

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,080


89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,080


90
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,080


91
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:39,820
fields. Erstwhile and young-born, the canterberries float like treelets in the night. Piss-born

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:48,860
and shovel-bound, the angry tenants of yesteryear clamor for remorse. Through the starlit nether

93
00:03:48,860 --> 00:04:02,240
regions, the grovers shout delight. Tantalizing but unrelenting, the government cheese steaks

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:12,640
dance like musselberries in the cantilevered wind. Born to shake a monkey butt through the

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,680
quivering lobes of love. Taste the paste.

96
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,940
At the back of your mind.

97
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,680
What are you going to call it?

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,420
I think I'll call it Bob.

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,200
Bob?

100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,860
Bob?

101
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
You don't like Bob?

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,520
You can't call a planet Bob.

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,500
Oh, so now you're the boss. You're the king of Bob.

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,680
Well, no. But...

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,200
What?

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,900
Can't you just call it Earth?

107
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,500
Well, no one said you had to live on Bob.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah, but...

109
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,380
They said I had to live on Bob.

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
I have to live off...

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,260
Me too!

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
Yeah, and Princess, we...

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,300
We had to...

114
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,500
We have to live on...

115
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,580
Live on Bob.

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,240
On planet Bob.

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,260
Oh, and welcome, dear friends, to Hour of Slack, number 1038.

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,980
Can you believe it?

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,460
And, uh...

120
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,480
What?

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
1038?

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah, and we're live tonight, this 1038th.

123
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,200
So, that means Dr. Sinister doesn't have to hurry towards the station so fast.

124
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,560
We're hoping that Lonesome Cowboy Dave, that ignorant, ignorant cowboy, will call in.

125
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,280
And, uh...

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:41,280
In the meantime, I should mention that this show tonight, we're presenting a new talent that we've gotten turned on to.

127
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,500
He's our new short-duration personal savior to replace Bob temporarily.

128
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,300
You know, I mean...

129
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,500
That's the nice thing about this religion.

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,300
You get tired of Bob every now and then.

131
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,080
You can just throw him off your back.

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,460
Throw the old monkey off your back.

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,220
And worship Johnny Future, for instance, who was the person just, uh...

134
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,260
The redneck talking about the bloated...

135
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,900
Her...

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,580
Her Mofra forums a second ago.

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,700
And also helped, uh...

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,380
Bring the show in along with all the lemur...

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,780
And nor-el-pref...

140
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,860
Clips and cut-ups.

141
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,060
Yeah, Johnny Future.

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,700
We're going to be playing...

143
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,560
More songs by Johnny Future.

144
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,380
Some of them are kind of raw and rude, so I've...

145
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,340
You may hear some of the cuff-cutting and tish-cutting that we have to do.

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,940
He's from Arkansas.

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,720
And he seems to be like a singing...

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,060
Another, uh...

149
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,620
A Jane or Hyperclete, or a Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

150
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Only, uh...

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,380
He's probably not as mean as Jane or Nora's nice as Dave.

152
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,760
We'll be playing more of that.

153
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,100
And, uh...

154
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,600
And the usual.

155
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,820
Actually, if Dave doesn't show up, I'll read to you from my new favorite books.

156
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,500
By Terry Pratchett.

157
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,900
There's this British writer.

158
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,000
Some of you may be...

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,840
This may be really old news to some people, but there's this fantasy series of satirical books, actually.

160
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,740
They're not so much fantasy as satire using a fantasy world that's great, called the Discworld.

161
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,480
And these books by Terry Pratchett.

162
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,840
There's...

163
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,360
There's, uh...

164
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,780
Like 35 or more of them out now.

165
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,200
Princess Wee and I are both hooked on them.

166
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,400
And you'll see why if I get around to reading any of the stuff from that.

167
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,120
This music in the background, which is sort of insane and possibly annoying, I don't know,

168
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,860
is by Just John, Reverend Just John, a subgenius who makes his own, rolls his own CDs and sends them in.

169
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,760
You can do that, too.

170
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,740
No.

171
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,020
No guarantee that we'll play them.

172
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Anyway, friends, Dave may be calling any second now.

173
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,220
So, uh, while we still can make a little bit of no sense, let's do it.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,020
We're alive!

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,940
Alive, I tell you, alive!

176
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,940
Let's go, man!

177
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,160
Hello, you're on Car Talk.

178
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,340
Oh, Toyota 4Runner.

179
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,120
I had about 100,000 miles on it.

180
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah, they feel their own bodies.

181
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,220
Their bodies.

182
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,140
They're hopeless.

183
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,580
Bob.

184
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,780
Bob.

185
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,920
Bob!

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Bob!

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,940
Looking for ways to microwave some grandkids on a rainy Saturday afternoon?

188
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,260
This rainy day or any day entertainment fun is available by microwaving your grandchildren.

189
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,720
Me and we're signing a pledge of allegiance.

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:09:03,660
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic in which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

191
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,060
You're just 10th.

192
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,660
You need the kind of relaxation only the bedroom of next Tuesday can provide.

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
Satan is home.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
The biggest major.

195
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,400
Major weapon.

196
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,600
Swallow.

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,500
Swallow.

198
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,220
My big, big gun.

199
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,980
Swallow.

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,820
Inch by inch.

201
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,860
Communist corn.

202
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,880
The war against your penis was fought on the planet Zorbi.

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,080
100 years ago in the dark.

204
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,720
The only war that was ever fought in the whole dark.

205
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,040
The whole war was fought in the dark.

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,240
Nobody could see a damn thing.

207
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,420
Nobody knew what they were doing.

208
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,540
They were making.

209
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,540
Battle plans in the dark.

210
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,980
They didn't know who the hell they were after that.

211
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,680
Nobody knew.

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,500
No one cared eventually.

213
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I can't say a goddamn thing.

214
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,520
I'm going to tell you what.

215
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,800
Well, I'll tell you what.

216
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
You know, one thing is, you know, people say the Holocaust was never happened.

217
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,680
You know what never happened?

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:04,960
Really?

219
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,000
Civil War never happened.

220
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,540
It's all made up.

221
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,960
It's made up by Mark Twain.

222
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,480
It's actually a chapter in the Huckabee family.

223
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,520
Civil War.

224
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,020
Yep.

225
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,340
That's where it happened.

226
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,460
And then people heard about it.

227
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,520
And they thought, you know, well, if Mary Penn's real, the Civil War must be real too.

228
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
And that's how that happened.

229
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,480
There never was a North or a South.

230
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,800
It was all made up.

231
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,040
Made up as lies.

232
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,560
It was a lot of propaganda started by the Indians.

233
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,580
And the Indians wanted the white man to fight each other because they wouldn't be fighting them as much.

234
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,840
They'd be like, hey, big chief, look here what I'm thinking about doing.

235
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,420
Watch out.

236
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,400
Well, look here.

237
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,700
When we get them Northerners fighting the Southerners.

238
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,240
The East Westerners and the Easterners fight.

239
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,000
And each other wasn't up.

240
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,360
And they wouldn't be killing Indians all that long.

241
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,340
That's a pretty damn good idea.

242
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,540
But how are we going to do it?

243
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,740
Well, why don't we just lie about it?

244
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,380
All right.

245
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,180
That sounds good.

246
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,580
I'm an Indian.

247
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,280
I love to lie.

248
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,340
Because Indians, you know, they love to lie.

249
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,420
They've never been an Indian.

250
00:10:59,500 --> 00:10:59,840
That's the whole truth.

251
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,500
Never was.

252
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Never was.

253
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,500
Never.

254
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,640
Never.

255
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,200
All Indians do are make these broad generalizations.

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,080
That's all they can do.

257
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,000
That, that, that, that.

258
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,960
And they must have been a little lucky.

259
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,320
They won't ever.

260
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,840
I would call up Mark Twain on the phone.

261
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,720
I'd say, Mark Twain, that was what they do.

262
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,220
But you lie about the Civil War and making people think it's happening.

263
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,100
I'll put it in my next book called Hope, Mary, Man.

264
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,480
All right then.

265
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,000
That's how that happened.

266
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,780
I studied history.

267
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,200
I know.

268
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,300
Next.

269
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,760
Friends, that was Johnny Future.

270
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,260
I told you I was going to be playing some Johnny Future.

271
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,600
It's really weird.

272
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,960
St. Byron Warner sent me that.

273
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,840
And I don't think it's on any real record company.

274
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,280
In fact,

275
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,700
I think it's some friend of Byron put that thing together using this Johnny Future guy.

276
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
Very, very strange.

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,940
Well, we'll, as we, I am going to go ahead and read a little bit out of this,

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
one of my favorite Terry Pratchett novels.

279
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,020
I prefer to think of them as nonfiction.

280
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,340
This is from one of my favorites called Small Gods.

281
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,380
It's, it's about a god who has,

282
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,180
he had this huge religion on Discworld,

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,500
but it turns out that all the believers were kind of believing in the,

284
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,700
everything but the god itself.

285
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,300
And he's, the god is turned back into a,

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,380
well, he's just a turtle now.

287
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,580
He only has one believer left.

288
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,400
That believer is an idiot, a subgenius.

289
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,940
But as it says here, where do gods come from?

290
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,380
Where do they go?

291
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,120
And the attempt to answer this was made by the religious philosopher,

292
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,100
Kumi of Smael,

293
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,880
in his book, Ego Video Liber Diorum,

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,820
which translates into the vernacular roughly as,

295
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,260
Gods, a spotter's guide.

296
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,820
People said there had to be a supreme being,

297
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,220
because otherwise how could the universe exist, eh?

298
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,580
And of course there clearly had to be, said Kumi,

299
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,860
a supreme being,

300
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,760
but since the universe was a bit of a mess,

301
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,200
it was obvious that the supreme being hadn't in fact made it.

302
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,620
If he had made it, he would, being supreme,

303
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,700
have made a much better job of it,

304
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,460
with far better thought given taking an example at random

305
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,660
to things like the design of the common nostril.

306
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,380
Or to put it another way,

307
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,820
the existence of a badly put together watch

308
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,920
proved the existence of a blind watchmaker.

309
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,660
You only had to look around to see that there was room

310
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,460
for improvement practically everywhere.

311
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,000
This suggested that the universe had probably been put together

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,980
in a bit of a rush by an underling,

313
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,860
while the supreme being wasn't looking,

314
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,840
in the same way that Boy Scouts Association minutes

315
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
are done on office photocopiers all over the country.

316
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,280
So, reasoned Kumi,

317
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,380
it was not a good idea to address any prayers to a supreme being.

318
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,580
It would only attract his attention and might cause trouble.

319
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,120
You can see how a subgenius might enjoy this Terry Pratchett philosophy.

320
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,920
And yet there seemed to be a lot of lesser gods around the place.

321
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,960
Kumi's theory was that,

322
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,420
the gods came into being and grow and flourish

323
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,020
because they are believed in.

324
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,180
Belief itself is the food of the gods.

325
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,040
Initially, when mankind lived in small primitive tribes,

326
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,060
there were probably millions of gods.

327
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,580
Now there tended to be only a very few, very important ones.

328
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
Local gods of thunder and love, for example,

329
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,940
tended to run together like pools of mercury

330
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,640
as the small primitive tribes joined up

331
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,100
and became huge, powerful primitive tribes

332
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,940
with more success.

333
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,840
They were sophisticated weapons.

334
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,400
But any god could join.

335
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
Any god could start small.

336
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,660
Any god could grow in stature

337
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,580
as its believers increased

338
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,120
and dwindle as they decreased.

339
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,860
It was like a great big game of ladders and snakes.

340
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,500
Gods liked games, provided they were winning.

341
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,540
Kumi's theory was based largely on the good old Gnostic heresy,

342
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,860
which tends to turn up all over the multiverse

343
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,660
whenever people get up off their knees

344
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,640
and start thinking for two minutes together,

345
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,280
although the shock of the sudden altitude

346
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,040
tends to mean the thinking is a little whacked.

347
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,740
But it upsets priests,

348
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,160
who tend to vent their displeasure in traditional ways.

349
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,620
When the Omnian church found out about Kumi,

350
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,660
they displayed him in every town within the church's empire

351
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,600
to demonstrate the essential flaws in his argument.

352
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,600
There were a lot of towns,

353
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,720
so they had to cut him up quite small.

354
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,340
W feast rtugs

355
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,340


356
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,280
On my meds again

357
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
Kousaka

358
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,640
The

359
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,440
man Everyone You Do

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,020


364
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,020


365
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,020


366
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,020


367
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,820
I can't wait

368
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,260
I can't wait

369
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,260


370
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,280
more

371
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,480
Gotta take my Zyprexa and my Klonopin

372
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,580
I can't wait to get on my meds again

373
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,140
On my meds again

374
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,120
Cause when I go off them I go down the highway

375
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm at odds and ends

376
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
With strangers I think should be going my way

377
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,460
And they all say

378
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,740
On your meds again

379
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,900
You really need to get on your meds again

380
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,080
Maybe when you do we can make some amends

381
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,940
Get on your meds again

382
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,920
On my meds again

383
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,740
Cause when I go off them I go down the highway

384
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm at odds and ends

385
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,260
With strangers I think should be going my way

386
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,240
And they all say

387
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,520
On your meds again

388
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,520
Gotta stop smoking that brown Mexican

389
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,900
Maybe when you do we can just start again

390
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,540
Before I now get on your meds again

391
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,660
And I'll be on my meds again

392
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:45,660


393
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,060
With strangers I think should be going my way

394
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,420
On my meds again

395
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,980
Cause when I go off them I go down the highway

396
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm at odds and ends

397
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,460
With strangers I think should be going my way

398
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,120
Before I now get on my meds again

399
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,420
And they all say

400
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,000
On your meds again

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,520
I'm at odds and ends

402
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,900
Before I now get on your meds again

403
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,580
So I'll just be going my way

404
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,100
Which they'll say

405
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,920
And I'll be on the road

406
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,620
What's the worst scary adventure

407
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:17,620


408
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,600
Alongside all the

409
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,000
The ramparts you've illustrious

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,500
With reli

411
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,500


412
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,500


413
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,500


414
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
Who've made their relationship

415
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:24,740
Of a town

416
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,120
Do not need

417
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,400
The comfort of someone

418
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,400


419
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,060
But football

420
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,300
Would refuse to additional

421
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,880
Coz they engaged

422
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,740
about this God who, he used to be really big, but he's small now,

423
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
and he's trying to get his powers back.

424
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,800
And his one believer, the subgenius, who's half-wit,

425
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,920
an idiot savant, is praying again.

426
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,300
The name of the believer is Brother,

427
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,940
and the name of the God is Om, the great God Om.

428
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,860
Om listened curiously.

429
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,580
He could remember prayers.

430
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,700
There'd been a lot of them once.

431
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,400
Once so many that he couldn't make out an individual prayer,

432
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,040
even if he had felt inclined to, but that didn't matter,

433
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,800
because what mattered was the huge cosmic susurration

434
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,480
of thousands of praying, believing minds.

435
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,540
The words weren't worth listening to anyway.

436
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,800
Humans, they lived in a world where the grass continued to be green

437
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,320
and the sun rose every day and flowers regularly turned into fruit,

438
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,740
and what impressed them?

439
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,680
Weeping statues and wine made out of water.

440
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,340
A mere quantum mechanistic tunnel effect that'd happen anyway

441
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,880
if you were prepared to wait zillions of years.

442
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,440
As if the turning of sunlight into wine by means of vines and grapes

443
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,180
and time and enzymes wasn't a thousand times more impressive

444
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,360
and happened all the time.

445
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Well, he couldn't even do the most basic of God tricks.

446
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,280
Now, thunderbolts with about the same effect as the sparks off a cat's fur,

447
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,780
and you could hardly smite anybody with one of those.

448
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,600
He had smitten good and hard in his time,

449
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,440
and now he could just about walk through water and feed the one.

450
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,180
And friends, now I think, I think I hear...

451
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,120
It is the Dave!

452
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,820
Do I hear, in fact...

453
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,880
It might be the Dave!

454
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,180
Do I hear a Dave?

455
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,560
Muck turtle to command headquarters.

456
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,960
It is Muck. He's traveling along at Muck turtle speed.

457
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,060
And just about three centimeters above the ground,

458
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,280
and at this altitude I can see quite clearly.

459
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,140
You have no idea of what you're talking about.

460
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, how can you...

461
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,500
Could you figure that out from there, Dave?

462
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,680
You can't hear the show, can you, from where you are?

463
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,900
I was intuiting that you were talking about the mutations tonight

464
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,960
among the, bless their hearts, the subgenius bobbies, so to speak.

465
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,960
You used to call them back before you had your thoracic implant.

466
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,880
No, we still call them that.

467
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,940
But here some of them are growing new appendages.

468
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,040
And, you know, I know it's an old subject,

469
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,680
but some of the subject material itself is quite new.

470
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,960
Well, you know, if...

471
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,680
The more you give Bob, the more will miraculously come to you.

472
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
Such as...

473
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
New things will grow on your body.

474
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,820
Tumors, warts, boils.

475
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,720
Gifts from Bob.

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
But therein lies the slack.

477
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,480
Those tumors, warts, and boils may provide you with a lot of extra...

478
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,200
And a lot.

479
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,400
You know, I noticed something in the back of my...

480
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,020
I quit doing those.

481
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,620
Luck.

482
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,600
Some people still smoke.

483
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,020
Those tumors and things.

484
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,800
I quit doing that.

485
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,160
For health reasons.

486
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,860
Why would you quit?

487
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,800
I mean...

488
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,680
No, health reasons.

489
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,680
You know?

490
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,940
Yeah, it was blissful until you came down.

491
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,420
It's not like frop, which you don't come down from.

492
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,680
You parachute lightly into a field of clover,

493
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,980
and then assassins jump out and begin flailing you with weird guilt trips and stuff.

494
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,340
Well, that's only in the first part.

495
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,660
That's when you're coming on.

496
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,240
That's the initial rush.

497
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,540
Before the actual little mini explosions in the DA

498
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,940
where they...

499
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,760
They lay the larvae, you know, right in the cell wall or something like that.

500
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,980
Well, as I understand it, the herb, habifrop, zipulops,

501
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,880
if you smoke it or drink it or whatnot,

502
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,920
actually just strips the sheath off of your ganglia, your nerve cells.

503
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,880
You know, they have kind of a tough sheath on them.

504
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,220
Well, that sheath is stripped away by the frop.

505
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,940
It doesn't really accelerate your thinking.

506
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,380
It just removes any hindrances such as common sense or...

507
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,620
Jimmy Hendrances.

508
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, man.

509
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,800
I saw him when I was 15 years old.

510
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,840
I saw one of them concerts.

511
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,200
The Jimmy Hendrance?

512
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,240
It was terrible.

513
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,920
Yeah.

514
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,980
It was awful.

515
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,540
I bet you were packing with about 20 pairs of socks

516
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,800
to make yourself look, you know,

517
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,800
encumbersome to all the young ladies.

518
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
I was only 15.

519
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,620
I was wearing a suit and tie

520
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,440
because I thought that's what you wore to a concert.

521
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,680
It was my first concert.

522
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm not being funny either.

523
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,700
I wish that I could.

524
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,900
Wow, man.

525
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,740
After all these years, you still are, you know, for Bob.

526
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,060
You're wearing a suit and tie,

527
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,440
going to various doors that have nothing to do with a,

528
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,680
you know, like doors of perception maybe or something.

529
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm a Jehovah's One witness.

530
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,440
Jehovah One's witness, I mean.

531
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,820
And what a sorry witness.

532
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,660
You're threatened many times as a Jehovah's One witness.

533
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Well, we're better off than the Jehovah Two's witnesses.

534
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,260
Yeah, they don't even come around and threaten them.

535
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
They just, you know, don't make a trial.

536
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:32,860
Well,

537
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,280
it's rough running a huge world religion

538
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,860
when you have no help.

539
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,280
That's the kind of religion it is.

540
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,820
Half-assed believers.

541
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,020
You have enough slobbers.

542
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,980
Half-assid believers, I should say.

543
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,140
But don't you have enough slobberers

544
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,540
coming out of the depths of Dobstown?

545
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,460
Don't you have enough pickerel

546
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,840
to amass a mighty fishy fortune for me?

547
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,580
What the hell?

548
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,820
That's about what it would be.

549
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,740
It would be a big mess that smelled like

550
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,260
fish and was whining and wanting more Bob.

551
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,100
And, you know, that's great.

552
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,620
But that's between them and Bob.

553
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,800
But they can still diddle around the furniture,

554
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,600
you know, and polish things up, you know,

555
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,060
like put the neck highs in order.

556
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,500
That would be nice if they could.

557
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,100
But remember, this isn't the Scientology Church

558
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,280
or the Catholic Church.

559
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,580
This is the sub-genius church.

560
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,880
So, first off, you know it's not geniuses.

561
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,300
They're not even allowed.

562
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,400
Don't even qualify.

563
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,140
Right.

564
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,840
Cut-off line is right there at sub.

565
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,600
As Bob's pointed out a thousand million times a second,

566
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,300
think how dumb the average person is.

567
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,960
Well, by definition, half of them are dumber than that.

568
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,440
And that's where we come in, Dave.

569
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,540
We're like the little dwarves at the circus

570
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,400
that run along behind the elephants

571
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,280
with our brooms and little carts.

572
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,280
I had a vision of those guys.

573
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,520
Did you?

574
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,720
Did you?

575
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,300
Yeah, I did.

576
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,860
I was thinking of little dwarves with brooms.

577
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,480
I couldn't imagine the elephants' derriere,

578
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,360
you know, quite yet.

579
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,440
But I knew what they were doing, kind of.

580
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,660
Isn't that weird?

581
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,180
Well, there's been a lot of coincidence

582
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,340
and synchronicity in the air lately.

583
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,580
There was a full moon earlier this week

584
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,620
as the reason for it.

585
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
And your lunacy causes you to notice

586
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,960
all those so-called synchronicities.

587
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,000
Actually, Bob causes these simple coincidences

588
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,640
to happen.

589
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,700
So that your human brain will misinterpret them

590
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,620
as being meaningful.

591
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,500
It's the same difference, though.

592
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,720
If you think it's meaningful, then it is.

593
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,100
But how and why does he do this to me and everyone?

594
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,940
So that you won't feel like your $30 was wasted

595
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,260
when you joined his cult.

596
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,540
It makes you feel like the magic is going on.

597
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,200
And it is.

598
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,900
The magic of your mind interpreting

599
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,860
such simple things as magic.

600
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,180
That was what we were just talking about.

601
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,840
But you couldn't hear,

602
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
because you were praying too hard, weren't you?

603
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,740
Of course I was.

604
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,820
You could have been listening to the Lord,

605
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,900
but you was talking to him.

606
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,520
Like he didn't know.

607
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,520
Like you had to explain to him what was on your mind.

608
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,620
I was focused on the pale heart of Somnaga

609
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,060
and all the other alien religions

610
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,960
that were going to be forced to bow down

611
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,720
and lick dirty boot to with.

612
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:23,980
Right.

613
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,000
At least Bob gives you a certain amount of slack

614
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,320
as mind control authoritarian figures go.

615
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,280
Relative to the other ones.

616
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,980
A non-existent trial period too.

617
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,440
Of which many people, if they care to,

618
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,420
you know, if they choose to use it or may not.

619
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,200
Except it's another example of free will at its worst

620
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,800
because Bob is controlling,

621
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,600
I still don't know how,

622
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,180
is controlling everything behind and in front

623
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,400
and right next to the scenes.

624
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,040
Well, you know, Dave, the great thing about Bob is

625
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,500
he's not really controlling it.

626
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,880
He's not, he doesn't even know what he wants.

627
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,300
But he always wants something.

628
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,440
And whatever he wants, because he's Bob,

629
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,600
fulcrum of the universal luck plane,

630
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,740
whatever's going to happen happens to be

631
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,060
what he happened to want to happen.

632
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,300
So Bob's prayers always come true at your expense.

633
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,400
And mine.

634
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,980
That's so cool the way that happens.

635
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,820
It is, it's cool.

636
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,560
At least somebody gets perfect luck

637
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,880
and slackdomness at all times.

638
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,280
But while the others berserk off into angles

639
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,560
that don't fit their nature.

640
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,020
Well, you can get,

641
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,720
you know, well, it's like,

642
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,940
it's like homeopathy.

643
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,060
I was reading an article about homeopathy earlier today.

644
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,960
And it said that homeopathy worked because of the energies.

645
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,560
Of course, it didn't mention what energies they,

646
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,440
that you don't, you aren't supposed to ask that

647
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,960
if you're being healed by faith.

648
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,660
Yeah, you don't say what energy is healing me,

649
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,580
you just hope it works.

650
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,020
But they had a good point.

651
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
It won't hurt you.

652
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,700
Your homeopathic medicine won't hurt you.

653
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,020
It won't do a damn thing.

654
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,260
One way or the other.

655
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,320
What about the steroids?

656
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,420
No, but you could say that about a placebo.

657
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,660
And yet a placebo like J.R. Bob Dobbs

658
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,680
can yet have profound brain damaging,

659
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,540
crippling effects on a person.

660
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,480
Just belief.

661
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,580
That's all it takes.

662
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,700
Belief is the medicine and it is the disease.

663
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,240
It's the, it's the gangrenous leg.

664
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,100
That has to be sawed off.

665
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,240
And it's the saw.

666
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,600
And it's the strap of leather you bite

667
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,320
while they're sawing.

668
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,780
And it's the slug of whiskey they give you

669
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,000
as they, as they start cutting away that bad thought

670
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,960
called your leg.

671
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,580
Yep.

672
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,080
Thank God for me, tenderizer and heroin, you know.

673
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,620
Or else we'd all surely, you know,

674
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,200
disappear into that vapid duct mark out of here.

675
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,920
Well, we will eventually.

676
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,980
We'll all, uh,

677
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,720
we'll all have to walk that desert.

678
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,860
But still, why?

679
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,020
With that skeleton man.

680
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,680
If Bob was just an immaculated schmo

681
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,100
like the rest of us schmos,

682
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,400
how come his schmohood has grown?

683
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,960
Well, he wasn't.

684
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,280
He never was normal.

685
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,720
Or rather, let us say he's so utterly,

686
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,740
he's the one true normal.

687
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,300
He's so normal, so perfectly

688
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,360
the epitome of the average

689
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,980
that it's weird.

690
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,800
It's real weird, man.

691
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,620
So then he's been picked as some sort of

692
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,300
classical icon that exemplifies weirdness?

693
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,840
It wasn't that he was picked.

694
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,140
It was that he was there

695
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,880
and we simply managed to finally notice.

696
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,220
Hmm.

697
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,220
See, once again, it's not Bob.

698
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,540
It's the belief in Bob that does all the, the, the work.

699
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,800
You, Bob doesn't have to do anything.

700
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,220
That's why I think my, my faith is so spotty.

701
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,940
Well.

702
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,960
You know, it's like a, it's like a charcoal thing.

703
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,380
You know, it, it just flakes all over the place.

704
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,040
It has no internal substance.

705
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,760
It has no drive socket.

706
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,180
I can't, it's, um, why he, it, where, who, where he,

707
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,880
Well, now, Dave, let me, let me ask you something.

708
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,200
Why?

709
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,240
When was the last time you tithed financially to Bob?

710
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,140
I think,

711
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,960
And I don't mean the gas you spend driving to the station

712
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,240
when your car works.

713
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,300
I mean, I mean, how much money did you give to J.R. Bob Dobbs?

714
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,280
Well, I think we,

715
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,280
Last year, for instance.

716
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:34,160
During the great blow drill, blow drills off, blow dry drills off Gitmo Bay there.

717
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,620
I think on Wednesday.

718
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,840
Uh-huh.

719
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,520
And how much exactly did you give him?

720
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,380
I thought it was another 30 smackaroos, but it could have been, you know, just a pittance.

721
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,160
Yeah.

722
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,720
Because I don't know what, you know, I was hanging out and it was fun.

723
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,540
And, uh, I may or may, I may have put more in there.

724
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,760
I can see you people from up here.

725
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,280
I know what you're putting in that car.

726
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,280


727
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,980
I know what you're putting in that collection plate.

728
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,980
I can see.

729
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,200
Do you think I'm blind?

730
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,340
You think I don't know what you people are doing out there?

731
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,900
I seen you stepping out with old Witter Jones.

732
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
I know what you're up to.

733
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,660
All you with me.

734
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,540
I know all you listeners out there.

735
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,720
I saw what you put in that pledge drive.

736
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,140
I know how much you love Bob.

737
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,120
You love Bob as much as Bob loves you, don't you?

738
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,260
For one who can see into the hearts and minds of the people,

739
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,260


740
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,460
not only the radio listeners,

741
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,300
but those who have either tithed or failed to tithe to Bob.

742
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,300
I, I, I forgot what I was talking about.

743
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,260
Me too.

744
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,300
Me three.

745
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,120
Did you have the Weltbekannt, the Vigaitwischlappen,

746
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,520
or what is it, the world-weariness,

747
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,760
the Weltbekannt, Weltbekannt,

748
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,660
or what are these to call it in the old German times?

749
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,400
The Dachsnefuschne-miners?

750
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,760
Yeah, in the, you know, in the,

751
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,780
The Baffnefuschne-miners?

752
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,060
In the, what do you call it, theater, you know, before fascism,

753
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,260
The Dachsnefuschne-miners?

754
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,260


755
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,340
took over the Europes.

756
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,220
What was it, not Rococo Abando,

757
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,440
what's the name of it, not Art Deco,

758
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,460
Bauhaus, not Bauhaus, it was the, you know,

759
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,000
Doghouse.

760
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,120
Cabaret, yeah, yeah, cabaret.

761
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,400
I don't know, man.

762
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:10,760
Cabaret.

763
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,320
You know, when they were all making fun of

764
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,940
Hitler's schlong size and, you know,

765
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,700
Goebbels' pooper tube and things.

766
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,120
Is that sort of like when we make fun of our leaders here in our country?

767
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,260
Well, it could be.

768
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,540
Except we have to remember they all died.

769
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,300
All of those cabaret guys who were great satirists and not just burlesques

770
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,840
were liquidated, much like maple syrup.

771
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,120
Oh, well, but that was in Nazi Germany.

772
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,000
Thank goodness we don't have to worry about anything like that happening here

773
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,500
in the United States.

774
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,040
Certainly we don't see any parallels to early

775
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,480
I think it's

776
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,280
the fourth Reich, or third Reich.

777
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
What Reich was that?

778
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,200
I think we're on number six now, really, but if they

779
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,880
What was that cover article of the scene we were just looking at, dear?

780
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,340
I'm glad I'm not that guy.

781
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,960
I've been made of, made fun of slightly in the scene and I'd really hate to have them

782
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,920
rip me a new mouth like they did that guy.

783
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,700
Anyway, friends, those of you who can't read our minds and don't know to which we refer,

784
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,140
just take my word for it.

785
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,120
It's really important and it's too late.

786
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,780
You missed out.

787
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,300
The easy way out.

788
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,520
The fat man's barbecue.

789
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,420
The insipid way of in-sipping.

790
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,220
Never mind.

791
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:47,000
Our previous show host, Charleston, says that he thinks that Chaney wanted to kill that guy that he shot.

792
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,320
And I was pointing out that any idiot can accidentally shoot another idiot in the face.

793
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,620
Yeah, I've done it myself.

794
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,780
You know, we've all done that.

795
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,640
I mean, haven't you shot somebody in the face accidentally once or twice?

796
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,860
Yeah.

797
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,180
I think everybody, everybody within calling range right now, anybody within that, with an earshot of this transmission,

798
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,700
if you've ever shot anybody in the face and not reported it to the police for either 14 hours or perhaps the rest of your life,

799
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,920
would like to tell us about it or anybody else, don't do it.

800
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,360
Yeah, don't tell us.

801
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,820
We don't want, we were trying to keep what they call a plausible deniability or deniable plausibility.

802
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,200
Well, when birdshot is in the face, you call it a low profile.

803
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
It's a joke.

804
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:46,320
Unfortunately, I think it was all a ploy, like one of those, like, leather nun masks, you know, like when you think it's Sister Mary,

805
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,400
and all of a sudden she pulls off and there's like, erectus nickels.

806
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,340
Like Myrna Ploy.

807
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,860
Yeah.

808
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,480
And then what do they call those titty things that, oh, geez.

809
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,060
The ones that bark, that make noise, the breasts that make noises, they squeak and squack.

810
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,080
The breasts that make noises?

811
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,260
Yeah, like, you know, she's dressed like a nun.

812
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,780
You know, she's like sister, she's like a sister.

813
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:18,960
And all of a sudden she's like, you know, wearing these weird like armaments and stuff like that.

814
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,840
A lot of it's spent plutonium stuff they're turning into craft industries to try and revive the Northeast.

815
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,500
Have you been to any of those places yet?

816
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,980
I've seen the glow from a distance.

817
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,560
A lot of good porn stuff made from spent plutonium.

818
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Porn stuff, did you say?

819
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,700
Well, yeah, you know, like...

820
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,260
I was starting to get bored until you said that.

821
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,640
Well, evacuator tubes, plugies, snipper snappers, I guess they're called them now.

822
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,880
All those little devices that are fun for, I don't know, some form of animals using, but...

823
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,440
Well, Dave, you live near a power plant, nuclear power plant in Ashtabula, right?

824
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,160
It's actually closer to Cleveland, but I guess the wind, they expect the wind to always go one way.

825
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:13,920
My family in Texas lives within the shadow of a gigantic nuclear power plant.

826
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,620
And I used to ask my mom, don't you know?

827
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,040
Don't you worry about, you know, China syndrome or something?

828
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:28,160
And she said, ah, protesters came out here from Dallas and they sent up a bunch of balloons to show which way the wind would blow all the radiation.

829
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,160
And it all went towards Dallas and away from us.

830
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,040
So screw them.

831
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,780
Well, that's a genuine thing your mom said.

832
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,720
That was my mom.

833
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,400
And many others have said that.

834
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,300
Bless her heart.

835
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,020
Yeah, it's going to blow the poison the other way.

836
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,020
I don't care.

837
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,460
That's what I've heard many people say in this area.

838
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,080
Which is why they worry about this and not the stuff the other way.

839
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,280
You know, it's just human nature.

840
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,680
If it's going to happen to the next guy, then you want to make sure everybody knows how bad you feel about that.

841
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:07,380
If it happens to you, well, nobody's going to really be hearing from you unless you're that lucky person that gets interviewed on television.

842
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,260
The only real person in any disaster is the one who makes it on TV.

843
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,600
Going, it was the most horrible thing in the world.

844
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,580
And nothing could be worth it except this chance to be on your show, Geraldo.

845
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,840
Yeah, Geraldo has to look real sheepish.

846
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,540
He actually has to be wearing sheep clothing.

847
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,620
We hate to make money off of tragedy and horror.

848
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,280
But, you know, isn't that what most religions do?

849
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:45,000
I mean, we're here to make money off of people's frailties, foibles, foolishness, mumbling.

850
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,580
They thought I was a good man.

851
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm a fucking clutch and they pull me and drive.

852
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,340
Hey, as we get this, Dave, somebody else is trying to call in.

853
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,680
I actually know how to push the buttons and work this.

854
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:12,340
And I could, but you know what I'm afraid of is that we'll just get the, hey, hey, did you guys hear why Cheney really shot that guy?

855
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,120
Well, you're not certain that they could actually...

856
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,400
No, I don't know.

857
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,800
It could be a tax collector.

858
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,040
It could be the...

859
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,040
It could be one of the...

860
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,580
Yeah.

861
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,100
It could be George Bush.

862
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,200
I have so many occupations, I think it could be...

863
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,480
Maybe we should find out.

864
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,900
You ignorant cowboy.

865
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,460
You ignorant, ignorant cowboy.

866
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,740
I really want to play that.

867
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,940
He's dying to play that.

868
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,700
It's just burning a hole in his consciousness.

869
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:45,580
I think the Streets of Laredo was the first anti-gonorrhea syphilis song shortly after the Civil War when that cattle tune bombed.

870
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,340
And they were full of prostitunes.

871
00:38:49,920 --> 00:39:01,180
You were telling me earlier you thought that classic song, The Streets of Laredo, was about the cowboy dying from syphilis from hanging around with all the prostitunes.

872
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:10,360
This is one of the undercover, underbelly, so-called sodomizing werewolf theories that are circulating right now.

873
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,100
But wouldn't they just say it in the song and then it died of the clap?

874
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,740
It felt just like crap.

875
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:26,040
What would they call a person's rod of presumptuousness back in the days of...

876
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,460
His Dave.

877
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,640
I'm not familiar with that literature.

878
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,600
His Dave.

879
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:29,980
Dave.

880
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,920
The knave's Dave.

881
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,140
The knave they called it?

882
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,900
His Dave was sticking proudly from his suit of armor.

883
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,540
Ah, the knave.

884
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:38,840
Yeah.

885
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,100
Now, what was the woman's blossom referred to in the days of the glorious?

886
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,880
The glorious south and the...

887
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,400
The plum.

888
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,540
...thrifty north and all that crap.

889
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,320
The plum.

890
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,180
The plum.

891
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,080
Right.

892
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,760
The plum.

893
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,720
Fruits and card houses.

894
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,500
Yeah, or the crabapple.

895
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,520
That was another name for the...

896
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
For elderly women's vaginas, right?

897
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,740
Dave, we're trying not to spell these scientific terms out.

898
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,720
It's better if you use gutter talk so that the kids don't understand.

899
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,100
The old-timey gutter talk.

900
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,080
I thought that was one of them, but...

901
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,540
What a plum.

902
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,440
What a plum job that was.

903
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,080
What a fine...

904
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,360
Well...

905
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:26,440
So, we see tomato emerging much later, perhaps even in 1920s or 30s in the jazz area.

906
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,580
Wow, what a tomato.

907
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,540
What a pippin.

908
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,020
These are sexist terms, though.

909
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,720
What a dish.

910
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,600
What a melon.

911
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,320
What a pair of melons.

912
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,280
Yeah, boy, he had a big dish on him, didn't he?

913
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,760
I remember they used to say that.

914
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,060
You're telling me that's a dish?

915
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,060


916
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,060


917
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,380
I'm talking about the people who wear satellite hats.

918
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,700
Yeah, they talked so funny back in the olden days.

919
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,500
Not like now.

920
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:55,920
The way people talk now, you know, saying things like, you know, that's gonna last forever.

921
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:02,180
People will always talk this way, and they will never sound funny to say things like,

922
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,680
been there, done that.

923
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,780
That'll never sound like a stupid 1990s or 2000s cliche.

924
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,060
Yeah, you can't use this euphemistic...

925
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,400
Euphemistic early 21st century language when you time travel.

926
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,960
If you were like to go back into old silo to be amid the gunfire and the rancorous ointments

927
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,700
and the, you know, whatever they were doing there, I think, or perhaps you went back to

928
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,780
medieval times, you know, and they speak English here, you know, it would sound like Beowulf

929
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,960
or one of those guys, I think.

930
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,940
You know, and you'd...

931
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,040
Well, by the same token, if you were to go forward into the future, you know, you'd be

932
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,040


933
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,040


934
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,600
in the future, the first few words out of your mouth would have people rolling on the floor.

935
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,240
They'd be going, God can't believe it, he said, dude.

936
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,060
Everybody says man now.

937
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,740
They would think you're from the, one of the like sticks, from the communities that had, you know, like sticks in them and stuff like that.

938
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,900
And then maybe you were a, you were like pigs and things.

939
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,920
Yeah, twig people.

940
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah.

941
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,180
The sticky people, sticks from the, from the hicks.

942
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,420
Out in the hicks.

943
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah, that run generators with pig parts.

944
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:18,880
Well, Dave, I want to, I actually want to quit talking and just play some recordings because we do have this, it is a radio show.

945
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,200
Oh, so I suppose you're calling it a radio show now.

946
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:32,160
Yeah, and well, it's a religious radio show and although, although we're the most entrancing conversationalists in the whole world...

947
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,560
Sometimes.

948
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,520
No, all the time.

949
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,280
It's just that you can't hear just human voices all the time.

950
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,880
It makes you...

951
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,260
It makes, it makes my teeth hurt to hear your voice for more than 15 minutes at a time.

952
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,160
Now my, hearing my voice for a long, long time, it kind of turns me on sexually.

953
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,960
I get excited.

954
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,980
I come home from these shows and listen to my own voice and sort of, you know, do whatever I want to with it.

955
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,580
You know what I mean?

956
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
I have the adverse effect.

957
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,600
You know, when I listen to myself for a protracted period of time, I go into orgiastic, you know, things here.

958
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,340
I've passed out before.

959
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,000
Out of shame?

960
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,800
No, I, you know, I think it was pure...

961
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,340
Oh, pride.

962
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,240
Oh, because the...

963
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,860
Yeah.

964
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,860
The blood all went to your pride.

965
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,900
The blood went to my pride?

966
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,720
Yeah, and you lost your head.

967
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,680
That was the way I, that's what I thought always happened every single show.

968
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,060
Well, that's what, how Melville would describe an erection.

969
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,480
Oh, now listen to this, Dave.

970
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,640
Okay, I'm going to read to you this little bit about, speaking of erections.

971
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,820
There's this country called Ephibia.

972
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,860
Where they have erections.

973
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,020
The Ephibians believed that every man should have the vote, it says.

974
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,260
Every five years, someone was elected to be tyrant.

975
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,920
Provided he could prove he was honest, intelligent, sensible, trustworthy.

976
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,780
Immediately after he was elected, of course, it was obvious to everyone that he was a criminal madman.

977
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,300
And totally out of touch with the view of the ordinary philosopher in the street looking for a towel.

978
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,760
And then, five years later, they elected another one just like him.

979
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,020
And really, it was amazing.

980
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,360
How intelligent people kept making the same mistakes.

981
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,920
Candidates for the tyrantship were elected by the placing of black or white balls in various urns.

982
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,000
Thus giving rise to a well-known comment about politics.

983
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,080
And black balls, I guess.

984
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,920
Well, right, you've been black balled, meaning you've been omitted from the ballot.

985
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,380
And having your parts stricken.

986
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,140
And that was, that reading was from my favorite book of the hour.

987
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,900
Small Gods by Terry Pratt.

988
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:46,380
Not to be confused with, what's that book by Dave DeLuca that's going to be coming out someday when that agent finally sells it to somebody?

989
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,160
InfoZone or Infomercial or something like that?

990
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,740
Something like that.

991
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,880
It's about Upton Sinclair's plan to take over the world.

992
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,660
Yeah.

993
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,800
And luckily, Sean Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, whatever his name was, discovered the plot.

994
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,500
So I don't know, maybe things won't work out, but maybe they will.

995
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,460
So I've still got my eyes crossed.

996
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,880
And just praying for him.

997
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,440
And praying for the sun to shine.

998
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,680
Dave and I both have our eyes crossed because we both got a literary agent.

999
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,620
And he's a happy kind of fellow.

1000
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,360
He's a nice fellow.

1001
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,780
He's a good subgenius.

1002
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,600
When he was a young fellow, he played in a subgenius band in Houston.

1003
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,520
We don't know if he's, we don't think he's slain any Malaysian children.

1004
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,680
Right.

1005
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,520
And so he's shopping Dave's Bible around.

1006
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,020
And of course, they're going to reprint Revelation X.

1007
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:43,400
And I'm supposed to whip out another Bob memoir or collection of Bob's memoirs.

1008
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,860
Well, it'll be the first thing you have whipped out in a while, Johnny.

1009
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:49,740
Sorry.

1010
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,320
The TV from Civil War commercial.

1011
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:01,540
So we've had the first subgenius testament and the second subgenius testament have been published or in bookstores and so forth.

1012
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,280
Well, one of them's not, but it will be again.

1013
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,840
And now there will be a third.

1014
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,000
The third text.

1015
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,360
The third testicle, you might say.

1016
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,280
If you've got to have to be confused with the fifth elephant.

1017
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,640
It's good to have an additional one.

1018
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,940
Third nostril.

1019
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,960
A third testicle staying.

1020
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:28,640
What a beautiful, brilliant vision of what man or woman should be carrying an extra.

1021
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,040
I mean, why didn't the women have a third testicle?

1022
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,400
They wouldn't need men around.

1023
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Um.

1024
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:34,780
Um.

1025
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,040
I don't understand that one.

1026
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,160
Well, Dave, really, we should get off the we should get off the talking like I promised a little while ago.

1027
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,760
I just want a third arm.

1028
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,680
Let's see.

1029
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:53,500
Now I have two cowboy songs, the subgenius midnight cowboy and that ignorant, ignorant cowboy.

1030
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,840
Those would be on.

1031
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,920
Well, we'll see.

1032
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,600
Dave, I'm going to bid you farewell.

1033
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,240
And I bid you one also.

1034
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,580
And to all of you.

1035
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,880
And to all ignorant cowboys out there.

1036
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,360
Keep yourself well sheathed.

1037
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,760
And remember that it's not the Lord who protects.

1038
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,580
It's Bob who controls.

1039
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,520
So, you know.

1040
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,960
Brace, Bob.

1041
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:17,620
Yes.

1042
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,920
Brace, Bob.

1043
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,440
Brace, Bob.

1044
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,980
And Brace, Dave's.

1045
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,400
And.

1046
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,080
Naves.

1047
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,400
Raised the wrong groove from the wrong track.

1048
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,280
Bless your little nads, Dave.

1049
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,260
Bless yours also.

1050
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,220
Your tiny little naves.

1051
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,540
I've, you know, I've thought about them.

1052
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,100
You've thought about my naves?

1053
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,640
Yeah, but not, not very.

1054
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,640
They're not, not in a, it's not an appetizing way or anything like that.

1055
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,980
Dave, keep those naves warm now.

1056
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,220
Which side of the solar winds you're drifting on, pal.

1057
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:52,300
You know, I mean, some beings out there find three extra naves pretty, pretty, um, uh, tillating.

1058
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,540
You know?

1059
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,160
Yeah.

1060
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,280
Okay, man.

1061
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,740
Bye.

1062
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,660
Okay, man.

1063
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:56,880
Bye.

1064
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:57,200
Okay, man.

1065
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,400
Bye.

1066
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,940
Don't make me angry, man.

1067
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,720
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1068
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
Yeah.

1069
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,960
I'll just lie back and think pleasant thoughts.

1070
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,220
Chicken pot pie.

1071
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,900
Chocolate covered raisins.

1072
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,400
Glazed ham.

1073
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,260
Uh-huh.

1074
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,400
Yeah.

1075
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:26,400
Yeah.

1076
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,380


1077
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:27,560
Okay.

1078
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,800
Yeah.

1079
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,660
Yay.

1080
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,100
Okay.

1081
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,520

1082
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:35,880
Okay, bro.

1083
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:35,880


1084
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:35,880


1085
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:35,880


1086
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,060
You're famous and you enjoy being a con.

1087
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,740
You know I have дивa radio and you�

1088
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,640
Hello, Prairie.

1089
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,220
Good to see you.

1090
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,180
I get to eat, right?

1091
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,180
I know you like the thing.

1092
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,940
That's too spotty.

1093
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,680
Multi of the people that enjoy kind of being around here, does it.

1094
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,680


1095
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,680


1096
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,740
You think you're too young?

1097
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,380
Does chip porta with a fork look like?

1098
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:57,740
Terry.

1099
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,020
Are you kidding?

1100
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,140
Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.

1101
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,460
Everything?

1102
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,920
Except that.

1103
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:14,700
Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa.

1104
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,300
Screw history.

1105
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,120
Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.

1106
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,320
I'm your mistruster, Zornberg.

1107
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:27,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1108
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,260
Come on, lighten up.

1109
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
What is this, a funeral?

1110
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,880
Why, you know what always cheers me up?

1111
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,880
Laughing at other people's misfortunes.

1112
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1113
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1114
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,300
Oh, well, it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.

1115
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,840
Forget it, you can't tempt me.

1116
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,600
Thank you and good night.

1117
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,680
Good news, everyone.

1118
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,840
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.

1119
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,180
I can't make this week's loan payment.

1120
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,300
Look into your hard drive.

1121
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,440
And open your mercy file.

1122
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,300
File not found.

1123
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,280
File not found.

1124
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,280


1125
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,220
Let that be a warning to you.

1126
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,260
Let that be a warning to you.

1127
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,300
I'm a cyclops.

1128
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,180
I'm a spaceship captain.

1129
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,920
I'm the only one of my species.

1130
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,940
And I'm interested in meeting a man.

1131
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,140
A woman? I'm scared.

1132
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,300
A woman? I'm scared.

1133
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,140
Uh, professor, are we even allowed in the forbidden zone?

1134
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,280
Uh, professor, are we even allowed in the forbidden zone?

1135
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,800
Why, of course. It's just a name.

1136
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,840
Like the Death Zone, or the Zone of No Return.

1137
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,580
Like the Death Zone, or the Zone of No Return.

1138
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,620
All the zones have names like that in the galaxy of terror.

1139
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,000


1140
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,300
All the zones have names like that in the galaxy of terror.

1141
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,500
Good news, everyone.

1142
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,640
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.

1143
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,820
But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.

1144
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,160
I don't know, Fry.

1145
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,140
For the first time in my life, I feel like...

1146
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,040
I've stolen enough.

1147
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,260
Ginger, snap out of it.

1148
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,540
Sorry, I don't know what came over me.

1149
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,160

Little wow

1153
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,980

00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,860

Searching

1158
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:38,420
Why are you looking for flexo in my underpants drawer? I didn't find him here ten minutes ago

1159
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,980
So I thought it was time to check again

1160
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,060
Don't be so hard on yourself fry you lost the woman of your dreams, but you still have the light burn

1171
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:26,940


1172
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:26,940


1173
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:26,940


1174
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:26,940

00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:26,940

1185
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,560
I don't care what they say

1186
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,080
Gonna ride to the next town

1187
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,540
See what trouble can be found

1188
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,980
Kiss the ladies but the fellas

1189
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,360
Kiss up genius and young

1190
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,000
My daddy was a yeti

1191
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,320
My mom a crusade

1192
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,900
On the day I was born

1193
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,300
I was ruptured and torn

1194
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,840
Raised as a mutant

1195
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,160
A subgenius student

1196
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,180
And a midnight cowboy

1197
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:35,080
Oh that's uh

1198
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,480
Reverend Ed Fred did that song

1199
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,780
Midnight Cowboy

1200
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,300
Now some lemur

1201
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,680
And then Johnny

1202
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,820
No, then Tom Gleiser with the ignorant cowboy

1203
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,760
The laundry followed a 14 year old boy

1204
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,520
There was a strange, unexplainable interest in the boy

1205
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,520
The laundry himself seemed to be so like the laundry that Tonto was amazed

1206
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,420
Yeah, I see what you mean

1207
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,620
Let's go to the house

1208
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,840
Here we are

1209
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,880
Let's go in

1210
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,100
Of course

1211
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,500
Yes

1212
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,060
These are mine

1213
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,420
I've never showed them to anyone before

1214
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,020
See?

1215
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,220
I see

1216
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,660
Did you send for a doctor?

1217
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,140
Well

1218
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,560
Tell us about it

1219
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,640
An ignorant cowboy went out on a spree

1220
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,820
And oh what an ignorant cowhand was he

1221
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,600
He had a few drinks and his head was a-whirl

1222
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,100
And he ended up in the arms of a girl called Katie

1223
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,960
That ignorant cowboy

1224
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,520
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1225
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,740
Now that cowboy was awfully handsome they say

1226
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,260
As I'm sure he could tell from his mirror each day

1227
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,600
But many weeks later one morning he saw

1228
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,080
A rash on his face and he cried with a roar

1229
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,180
What is it?

1230
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,940
That ignorant cowboy

1231
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,420
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1232
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,880
That cowboy was worried and fretted and frowned

1233
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,220
And he went to his medicine chest and he found

1234
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,640
Some wonderful tonic that must have been hot

1235
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,080
Supposed to be good for whatever you got

1236
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,240
And he took it

1237
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,900
That ignorant cowboy

1238
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,500
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1239
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,720
Now that cowboy each morning he washed at the sink

1240
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,140
And then came one morning when what do you think

1241
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,420
The spots on his face they had all gone away

1242
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,040
He looked and he shouted tie yippee tie yay I'm cured

1243
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,960
That ignorant cowboy

1244
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,480
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1245
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,820
That handsome young cowboy was happy once more

1246
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,180
Cause nobody ever had told him the score

1247
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,520
But the germ that had got him was still there inside

1248
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,060
Cause this is a treacherous germ that will hide inside

1249
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,200
That ignorant cowboy

1250
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,640
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1251
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,900
Now partners it surely is sorrowful strange

1252
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,440
To think of that cowboy a-riding the range

1253
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,840
Not knowing someday he'll be surely struck down

1254
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,280
By the germ that he caught when he went up to town

1255
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,240
On a spree

1256
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,160
That ignorant cowboy

1257
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,620
That ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1258
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,940
Now a ranch on the range isn't likely to find

1259
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,460
Much use for a cowboy who's dead, lame or blind

1260
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,900
So if you've known Katie please listen to this

1261
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,360
Only a doctor can cure syphilis

1262
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,160
Don't be

1263
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,200
An ignorant cowboy

1264
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,680
An ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1265
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,100
An ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1266
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,040
An ignorant, ignorant cowboy

1267
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,860
Like Dave, that was Tom Glaser

1268
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,340
I'm sorry honey, but I don't love you no more

1269
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,840
Honey, I'm sorry

1270
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,480
But remember that time you went to help those children in the burning house

1271
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,520
And the fire burned your skin and caused that scarring on your face

1272
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,020
That's why I don't love you anymore

1273
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,060
I don't love you anymore

1274
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,640
Because your face has been disfigured while you're helping save those children

1275
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,020
And I just can't love you anymore

1276
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,780
Come back when you're younger

1277
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,060
Come back when you're not so old

1278
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,980
Apple told you how old my grandmother is

1279
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,500
Well, she's desperately old

1280
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,960
She's terribly, terribly old

1281
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,520
She's about to cross into the future

1282
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,880
And that was Johnny Future

1283
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,360
Take a rest, take a rest

1284
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,380
I'm sorry sir

1285
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,180
What?

1286
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,480
Yes

1287
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,760
That's okay

1288
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,240
Listen sister

1289
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,160
Well I do

1290
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,360
To a servant in this office

1291
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,760
Is to have felt a very personal sense of

1292
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:35,740
Well

1293
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,900
White House

1294
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,160
With a

1295
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,760
An ordinary mundane chore

1296
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,440
History was being made

1297
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,940
In our ordinary and mundane car

1298
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,920
Likely to see again in our lives

1299
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,820
A president

1300
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,100
Resigned his office

1301
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,780
Tomorrow

1302
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,420
And the world

1303
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,580
Goes on

1304
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:57,940
Their

1305
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,120
Gel-to-the-cheat

1306
00:58:59,120 --> 00:58:59,880
Gel-to-the-sheet

1307
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,160
Happy

1308
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,460
Happy

1309
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:15,500
I don't know what to do

1310
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,580
I don't know what to do

1311
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,860
I don't know what to do

1312
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,920
I don't know what to do

1313
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,100
I don't know what to do

1314
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,120
I don't know what to do

1315
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,560
I don't know what to do

1316
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,600
what to do. I don't know

1317
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,500
what to do. I don't

1318
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,680
know what to do. I don't

1319
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,740
know what to do. I don't

1320
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,880
know what to do. I don't

1321
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,700
know what to do.

1322
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,820
I don't know what to do.

1323
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,160
Yes, dear friends, little

1324
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,340
Theodore does not know

1325
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,540
what to do, but I know what we

1326
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,420
must do, and that is leave. You're

1327
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,380
listening to the Subgenius

1328
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,280
Radio Ministry Hour of

1329
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,400
Slack, and

1330
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,340

1331
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,200

1333
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,000
subgenius.com.

1334
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,220
I know what you should

1335
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,240
do, and that is

1336
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,900
check it out. Little

1337
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,140
Theodore, by the same token, is

1338
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,060
available at

1339
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,060

and Theodore is spelled F-Y-

1341
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,240
O-D-O-R.

1342
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,200
We heard some cut-ups by Norrell Preff.

1343
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,200
I wish I could tell you how to get

1344
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,480
hold of Johnny Future.

1345
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,820
The ignorant, ignorant

1346
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,620
cowboy was by Tom

1347
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,620
Glazer of the olden days,

1348
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,940
and I think that pretty much covers all the credits

1349
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,840
and so forth, friends.

1350
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,080
Stay tuned

1351
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,000

1352
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,180
the wisdom

1353
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,500
coming up next.

1354
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,320
Ha ha ha.

1355
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,720
And praise Bob.

1356
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,600
Praise Bob.

1357
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,600
Praise Bob.

1358
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,320
Praise Bob.

1359
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,300
Praise Bob.

1360
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,440
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.

1363
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,760
Praise Bob.

1364
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,480
Praise Bob.

1365
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,100
Praise Bob.

1366
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,100


1367
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,260
Praise Bob.

1368
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:31,900


1369
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,440
Praise Bob.

1370
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,520
Praise Bob.
