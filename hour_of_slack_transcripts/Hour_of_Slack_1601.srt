1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,520
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency subgenius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,080
We don't party like a subgenius party because a subgenius party got crushed.

3
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,800
News on the march.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,220
In the news here, I'm looking at the 19X Day page.

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,180
Look, some Reverend Mother Miller is on her way.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,820
I just got a phone call from her asking if women really were free or admitted free.

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,960
So the...

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,060
Jim.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,720
It looks like fun.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,260
The free women are coming.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,600
That's right.

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,860
But let's see now.

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,520
Where are we here?

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,220
There was some actual real news here.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,640
Okay.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,660
Well, for one thing, Pease is delayed.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,580
Pease Doug says...

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,600
That's one way to put it.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,060
...got screwed on a flight.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,560
Now standby.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,340
Called AA.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,800
Oh, poor guy.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,200
I guess he's got a drinking problem.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,160
Said standby.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,460
Those airport bars are going to kill him.

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,980
Means I...

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,960
I won't get there.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,900
They changed to real tickets about four hours later.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,600
And that Mother Miller said to him, have a drink and a Cinnabon.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,320
Okay.

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,640
And you can pay for it.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,100
So he's...

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,500
Actually, I heard I got a message.

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,180
Pease won't be in until late tonight.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Here's one from Sinfaltimus.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm here.

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,700
We're hoping it'll be late later.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,960
Hey, here's Reverend Andrews.

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,520
He says...

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Hey, guys.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,480
Don't tell Heathen, but I used his spoon without asking him first.

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,820
Andrea Volkerding says...

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,240
Grr.

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,300
I am bear.

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,580
I'm here for your beer.

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,500
And it's a news article about a bear downs 36 beers and passes out at a campground.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,100
Okay.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,180
Is that why that spoon smelled so funny?

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,540
What about the bears stealing the spoons?

50
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,540
Well, there was a raccoon at Brushwood that used to steal Playboys.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,460
Heidi Mintz says, I'll be down tomorrow with the chicken pox.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,060
And this Reverend Miller is very excited about coming here.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,240
And Cara says...

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:58,900
As I settle into heavy drinking in this town, I have named lower bunghole after my old Nissan broke down.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,820
I am reminded that being stuck here overnight isn't totally awful because there's lots of vodka and scotch in the world.

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,880
Also, I think this town has only one cop.

57
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,800
I bet I could take him.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,340
Is he on the way here?

59
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,740
Here's a picture of Reverend Annie, who I consider to be the best.

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,040
This is the second prettiest girl in the whole world.

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,980
And she's forlorn.

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,980
She had a selfie saying, someone please remember to fly by and pick me up on the fifth.

63
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,160
Shows a little bit of cleavage there.

64
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,880
Cleavage for Bob, as always.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,280
She's so beautiful.

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:48,020
Oh, I posted the video of the kazoo duet by APO Stacy.

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,380
And Anna Mall last night, which was really a good shot, by the way.

68
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,020
And it says, G. Gordon Gordon says...

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,460
I'm enjoying all this without being here.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,780
There.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,460
But I'm with you in spirit.

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,320
I do hope the weather is better than the last time I was in Ohio.

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,700
And he was here during the terrible duray show that killed everybody.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,660
Oh, here.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,080
Pease has a report on X Day.

76
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,740
Sha-na-na.

77
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,700
Has reunited to open the show tonight.

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,620
People are being told, no more glass bottles.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
The freeway is pretty backed up.

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,960
It's going nuts.

81
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,440
Hopefully you can make it through all the crowds.

82
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,480
And there's some pictures I posted of just a minute ago.

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,420
Oh, that's it.

84
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,400
Okay, that's the news.

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,660
Ah, yes, dear friends.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,440
About this Reverend Pease fella.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,440
He snuck into the Church of the Subgenius from Facebook, I think, about four years ago.

88
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,280
And at first...

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
We didn't know what to do with him.

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,600
On the internet, he was so charming and childlike and...

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,920
A seemingly brain-damaged way of it.

92
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,060
But he was just so lovable.

93
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,540
The bastard.

94
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,240
After a while, he was everybody's pal.

95
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,480
And he asked every newcomer to be his friend of it, too.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,740
Well, when you have a whole bunch of subgenius friends, they do things like make up songs about you.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,260
Special subgenius songs.

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,460
And when Pease finally got to Wisteria, there were old subgeniuses on stage.

99
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,880
Reverend Sinfaltmus, Reverend Angry Larry and them.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,880
And they were playing this song of it.

101
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,140
He ran up to the stage and grabbed a mic and joined in.

102
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,600
Now, cutting out the cuss words from this song for the broadcast radio version is going to be quite a challenge.

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Because the entire lyrical content is the phrase,

104
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,300
Fuck Pease.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,020
What?

106
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
Fuck Pease.

107
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,160
Fuck Pease.

108
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


109
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,160


114
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,000
Fuck Pease.

115
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,180
That was the pedal working, that wasn't me.

116
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,860
Fuck Pease.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,580
That wasn't me, that was all prerecorded.

118
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,420
This is me.

119
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,660
Fuck Pease.

120
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,060
alguma coisa.

121
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,360
Fuck you.

122
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,280
Fuck you.

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,680
Fuck you.

124
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,720
Putt.

125
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Putt.

126
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,600
We came down from the top.

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,600


128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,260
And did everything just fine at the stage.

129
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,700
We pulled out our shots.

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,880
The terms were good.

131
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,980
Good.

132
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,260
It did.

133
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,180
Hey, just for the quote-unquote record, we plan to do that song wrong.

134
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,280
Fuck Pease.

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,380
Just for the sake of it.

136
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,640
Everybody give it up for the fuck Pease.

137
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,980
And then, much to my surprise, Pease picked up one of the dozens of bass guitars lying around

138
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,680
and started jamming like crazy on jazz versions of old hippie songs.

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,700
Poor old Peasy came to Wisteria looking for Bob, but got some dizzy.

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:42,380
The wolf came out and bit poor Peasy, the spiders came out and bit poor Peasy, the dogs came out and bit poor Peasy, Bob came out and bit poor Peasy.

184
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:51,820
Poor Peasy! He got lost, he drove to Wisteria, but it was in Alaska.

185
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,640
Poor Peasy! Poor old Peasy!

186
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,840
Today is his last day there.

187
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:17,660
When I went back to work, my mind says, my dad taught me how to drive, and now I've become a horse driver.

This man is д outbreak of his train is Cass.

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,040
é

190
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,340
é

191
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,220
What's the hun 관?'

192
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,400
What are you? What are you?

193
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,420
I was a little late because you guys may not realize this in the throngs of people here, but the freeway is backed up for like 100 miles.

194
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,840
There's 6,000 people just waiting at the gate for registration to reopen.

195
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,400
.

196
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,580
.

197
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,100
.

198
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,620
.

199
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,020
Pretty sure what he's trying to say is fuck peace and fuck peace.

200
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,340
That was pretty much it.

201
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,240
I hated fucking up that song.

202
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,400
I felt sorry for it.

203
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,860
I would turn off it and kept singing.

204
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,760
It would not die!

205
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,160
It still won't die!

206
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,200
It will die!

207
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:20,360
The poor lost Reverend Pease finally found his way after terrible travails and a big fight with the airport people.

208
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,380
I captured that rant, by the way.

209
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,360
The airport people gave you some problems, Pease?

210
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,460
Oh, that's terrible.

211
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,280
He handed it right back to them, too.

212
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,500
He called up his friend Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and had them.

213
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,020
Hey, you got some action going there.

214
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Those fascist pigs were hassling a righteous dude.

215
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,020
Yeah, man.

216
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,740
I mean, yeah, dude.

218
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,700
But they didn't know.

219
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,860
Yeah, bruh.

220
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,420
Is that it?

221
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,980
What are...

222
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,060
Spiritual guidance from afar.

223
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,380
A magnetic line of force emanating from the wisteria campground.

224
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,460
Calling, beckoning, irresistibly forward.

225
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,640
So, I don't travel a lot.

226
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,280
But when I do, I like to make sure I'm surrounded by clean people.

227
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,460
So I can remember just what it's like to be a Yeti.

228
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,840
My day started out at 5.30.

229
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,860
I was full of slack.

230
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,940
You guys saw my picture.

231
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,700
I was posed to strike out the next day and framed by Sopher!

232
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,840
But no!

233
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,380
I was immediately spoiled.

234
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,460
Immediately.

235
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,920
Immediately.

236
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,520
I got to the ticket counter.

237
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,300
And a lady took one look at my Bob shirt.

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
And she decided to help me.

239
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
Oh, she helped me.

240
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,580
Here's what you need to do, sonny.

241
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,240
It's not a ticket.

242
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,420
But if you run real fast.

243
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,700
And you get through security.

244
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,800
You get an X-Day.

245
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,740
Four hours earlier!

246
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,600
Now.

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,180
Here was my mistake.

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm a master of time and space!

249
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
I didn't need her pink four hours.

250
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,020
I couldn't stand with those four hours in my spare time experimenting.

251
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
But no!

252
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
I trusted her.

253
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,540
So I went to the pink security.

254
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,900
And I didn't put my laptop in the bin right.

255
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,760
So I was pulled into a secondary inspection area.

256
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
Think about it.

257
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,580
Think about it.

258
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,000
Peace.

259
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,700
Is God's like peas in a secondary security area?

260
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,440
It doesn't make any sense.

261
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,200
And so before they can deal with my terrorist problem.

262
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,520
They have to make sure the mouth reader in front of me.

263
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,700
Isn't bringing on some kind of nefarious liquid over a ounce and a half in capacity.

264
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,720
Or perhaps.

265
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,820
He has some pornography.

266
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,820
Perhaps saying something to the great state of Ohio.

267
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,920
But regardless of all these functions.

268
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
It took these two gentlemen.

269
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,460
These fine agents of the TSA.

270
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,320
These pink agents of the conspiracy.

271
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,720
Over fifteen minutes.

272
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,760
And when they finally found the thumb sized non-bomb.

273
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,780
I was able to go on my way.

274
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,520
Needless to say I missed my flight.

275
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,380
And I could have lost it then.

276
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,780
But I have learned over the years my Yeti friends.

277
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,660
When she told me I was standby.

278
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,500
I said no.

279
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
You're on standby.

280
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,840
And I called Bob.

281
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,020
I called Bob!

282
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,260
Bob answered the phone.

283
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,160
Yeah Frank.

284
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,860
Peace.

285
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,480
What's up?

286
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,800
Bob!

287
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,420
I'm going next day.

288
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:09,800
Yeah.

289
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Yeah.

290
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,600
Yeah.

291
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:10,820
Yeah.

292
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,040
Yeah.

293
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,780
They took a long drive.

294
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,640
Of course you're going next day.

295
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,000
Peace.

296
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
I'm going to be there in three days.

297
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,160
Guaranteed.

298
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,480
Well Bob they got me going standby.

299
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,480
They're huffed up in me.

300
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,360
Bob said this won't stand.

301
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
So I was on hold.

302
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,860
I was on hold.

303
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,920
But it was okay.

304
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,500
It was worth it.

305
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Because the pinkest pink of them all.

306
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,440
Barack Obama.

307
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


308
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


309
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


310
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


311
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


312
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


313
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


314
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


315
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,500


316
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,380
Barack Obama came on the phone.

317
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,220
Obama.

318
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:40,820
Obama.

319
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,880
He said Frank.

320
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,980
And he sounded just like Bill Clinton.

321
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,120
He said Frank.

322
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,220
I want you to know Frank.

323
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,380
I got you on the very next flight out.

324
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,940
And I said thank you Elvis.

325
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,380
Barack Obama.

326
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,300
And now I'm here to tell you my story.

327
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:07,820
Except for one strange thing and I don't know if this guy was a sub genius or just the most

328
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,480
obnoxious.

329
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


330
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


331
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


332
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


333
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


334
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


335
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


336
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


337
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


338
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


339
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


340
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


341
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


342
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,280
his pink ever. But I watched

343
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,420
a man for four and a half hours

344
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,700
bite his fingernails

345
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,240
and pick the dead

346
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,220
flesh from his fingers and

347
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,040
spit it on his young

348
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,380
skateboard-holding son.

349
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,340
And that was my

350
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,360
trip to Hexgate.

351
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Oh, Reverend Pease dropped his big

352
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,460
camera into the pond, and now he's getting

353
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,340
bobtied. In for a dollar,

354
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,220
in for a dollar. Doug!

355
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,420
Reverend Pease, first bobtism.

356
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,580
So it is.

357
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,860
Reverend Pease,

358
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,140
I know that you have been beset

359
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,400
by the conspiracy, and you're probably harboring

360
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
conspiracy parasites,

361
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,140
demons, devils, and angels,

362
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,340
and guardian angels, and all kinds

363
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,360
of supernatural things, as well as

364
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,020
brain-eating amoebas, who are going

365
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,480
very hungry right now.

366
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,600
Do you accept, Bob?

367
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,280
One second.

368
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
Oh, it's a lot warmer now.

369
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,820
Yeah, sure, let's do it.

370
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,280
Okay, go!

371
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,520
That's it!

372
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,460
Woo-hoo!

373
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,860
And we are out!

374
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,740
We're done here.

375
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,720
We're done here.

376
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,860
So,

377
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,000
this is my first

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,960
Hexgate, Hexgate,

379
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,100
ready for such reason.

380
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,800
With it comes a few observations

381
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,180
and

382
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,440
slactations to

383
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,580
enthrall you and

384
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,180
hopefully enlighten you

385
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,400
on your last, final hours

386
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,180
on this

387
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,100
cloudy, muddy,

388
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,200
dirtball, we've all heard.

389
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,920
Okay.

390
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Let's get it.

391
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,560
Let's get it.

392
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,220
Let's get it.

393
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,660
Let's get it.

394
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,760
Slag.

395
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,000
You can't chase it.

396
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,800
You can't chase it.

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,360
You can't find it.

398
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,280
It has to come to you.

399
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,420
It has to come to you.

400
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,640
You can't covet it,

401
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,240
although if you try, you'll get

402
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,720
loaded up with empty slag.

403
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:09,900
Slag.

404
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,140
Slag.

405
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,440
Slag.

406
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,500
You hear him talk about it.

407
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,720
You hear him trying to find it.

408
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,380
But here's the thing.

409
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,160
It's different

410
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,040
for you. It's different

411
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,020
for me. And it's different

412
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,740
for that guy with that weird thing.

413
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,820
Slag.

414
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,160
Slag.

415
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,380
Talking about

416
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
Bob's Slag.

417
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,100
A lot of people are concerned.

418
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,700
They say we all know

419
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,900
next day is gonna be a going concern.

420
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
As we go on and on.

421
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,500
What should we do?

422
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,300
Who the fuck knows?

423
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,760
Slag.

424
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,640
Let it flow. Let it come.

425
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,480
Let it be. Let it run.

426
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,780
Slag.

427
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,720
Slag.

428
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,520
Slag.

429
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Slag.

430
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,160
Slag.

431
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,700
Slag.

432
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,980
Bob taught us one thing.

433
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,420
Maybe a few more.

434
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,940
He never defined

435
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,020
what it was. And that's how you know

436
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,240
it's the greatest thing he ever sold us.

437
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,500
Slag.

438
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,680
Slag.

439
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,080
It was theirs all along.

440
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Taken by the con.

441
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,920
Slag.

442
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,380
It's there for you.

443
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,920
Just let it flow.

444
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,840
Slag.

445
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,460
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

446
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,680
I'd like to take a moment of silence.

447
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,340
For silence.

448
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,600
See, that's what happens when you ask us to do just anything.

449
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,920
We'll do the opposite of whatever you tell us.

450
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,660
So what you should have said is, I want you to make a shit ton of noise.

451
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,820
Say, Doug.

452
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,080
Doug.

453
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,800
Doug.

454
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,600
Doug.

455
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,420
Doug.

456
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,640
Doug.

457
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:16,780
Doug.

458
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,060
Doug.

459
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,260
Doug.

460
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,500
Doug.

461
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,020
Doug.

462
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,420


463
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,460


464
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,460


465
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,480
Just look at all these Dougs.

466
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,340
Awesome, Doug.

467
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,260
That's the thing.

468
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,480
It's everyone here tonight.

469
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,320
Thank you, Doug.

470
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,560
Somebody can make it.

471
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I do not.

472
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,900
I do not understand how a guy who's been doing this.

473
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,680
For over 75 years.

474
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,120
Can write on the internet.

475
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,940
Don't call me Doug.

476
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,360
Okay.

477
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,580
I mean, you think that he would have some sense.

478
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,120
You think he would know that if you tell some geniuses to not call you Doug.

479
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,120
That's the first thing you're going to do.

480
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes.

481
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,360
Look at that.

482
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,280
Dumbest thing I ever did.

483
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,660
What is that?

484
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,340
Because I'm pretty sure that's high ranking.

485
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,880
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,100
I said, don't call me Doug.

487
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,160
And now everyone is called Doug.

488
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, everyone except for you.

489
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,780
How does it feel?

490
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,740
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,520
It's Doug three.

492
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,740
When we refer to you, you're Doug.

493
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, they're.

494
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,120
If you don't want to be Doug, we'll be Doug.

495
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,680
Fine.

496
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,180
Well, it's funny.

497
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,780
The very first subgenius is when there was only ten subgeniuses.

498
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,380
About half of them were named Doug.

499
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,140
We had numbers.

500
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,380
I was Doug three.

501
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,380
I think Doug one was some guy in Houston.

502
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,460
We have some numbers puzzling.

503
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,440
Puzzling evidence isn't right.

504
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,240
Are you Doug the second?

505
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm Doug.

506
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,500
Dr. Reverend Doug Esquire the second.

507
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Then there's a Dr. Reverend Doug Esquire the senior.

508
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,500
Oh, God.

509
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,240
Why did I do that?

510
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,740
I don't know.

511
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,980
We all asked ourselves.

512
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,260
Since you did it, we've all been asking ourselves what you were thinking.

513
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
Not to do a thing.

514
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,660
Why?

515
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,780
We looked at you for guidance and wisdom and you were like, what the hell was he thinking?

516
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,280
More echoes of him asking himself, what the fuck did I just do?

517
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,000
What?

518
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,720
What?

519
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,400
What?

520
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:03,960
What did I do?

521
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,760
I told subgeniuses not to do something.

522
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,100
I asked them politely not to do something.

523
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,060
That's the worst.

524
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,000
Hey, call me Doug, everybody.

525
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,260
And call yourselves Doug.

526
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,060
That's an order.

527
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,940
That should work.

528
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,420
Too late.

529
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,160
No.

530
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,940
Too late.

531
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,840
That one goes out to Fuck Peas.

532
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,360
For the tribute band, Fuck Peas.

533
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
And the Dugs.

534
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,220
We are the Dugs.

535
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,160
We're the Dugs.

536
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,380
We'll be here all weekend.

537
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,320
I thought it again.

538
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,840
Dave.

539
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,760
It's Dave.

540
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,200
We're on the air.

541
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,260
We're on the air right now?

542
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,080
Yeah, we're on the ear.

543
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,920
Yeah, we're on the ear.

544
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,600
We're in the ether right now.

545
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,120
We're in the convulsing ether implementing plans against the .

546
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,040
Never mind.

547
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,440
We'll see you guys.

548
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


549
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


550
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


551
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


552
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


553
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


554
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


555
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,440


556
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
what Dave said.

557
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,560
Yeah.

558
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,320
That's all you gotta do.

559
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,100
That's all you gotta remember

560
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,900
is what Dave said.

561
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,740
Yeah.

562
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,380
So can you hear us okay

563
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,160
this time, Dave?

564
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,120
I can hear you okay this time.

565
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,340
Can you hear me okay this time?

566
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,080
Oh, we can hear you

567
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
loud and clear, man.

568
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,540
Loud and clear.

569
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,240
It's exciting.

570
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,080
It's beautiful.

571
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,620
It's wonderful.

572
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,220
Yeah, it's like

573
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,180
a little tummy grabber.

574
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,980
It gets you a little

575
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,380
baby boner

576
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,440
thinking about it

577
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,840
or not.

578
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,060
So how's the new

579
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,600
incoming administration

580
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,020
treating you, Dave?

581
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,140
I've been receiving

582
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,560
these blue letters.

583
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,660
They're typed on blue paper.

584
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,940
And they're warning me

585
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,420
about something.

586
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,660
They say if I don't shut up,

587
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,340
if you don't shut up,

588
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,900
we're gonna have to go

589
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,120
to some place

590
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,160
to learn how to concentrate

591
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,680
or something.

592
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,820
They call them

593
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,360
patriot camps, I told you.

594
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,320
Yeah, patriot camps.

595
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,040
We're gonna have to go

596
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
to a patriotic camp

597
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
and wave flags around

598
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,820
and stuff like that.

599
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,260
Yeah, they're...

600
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,820
Well, I got one of those

601
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,580
blue letters,

602
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,600
but since the ink

603
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,300
was also the same color blue,

604
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,860
I couldn't read any of it.

605
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,700
Yeah.

606
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,520
Well, it's not funny

607
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,860
if it's really a summons

608
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,080
to the patriot camps.

609
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,820
I thought they understood.

610
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,740
We're just kidding.

611
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,140
This is just a comedy show.

612
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,560
It's not like they're trying

613
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,320
to shut down

614
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,380
the complete freedom

615
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,060
of the press

616
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,240
and the First Amendment.

617
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,420
No.

618
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,660
That would be unpatriotic,

619
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,280
un-American.

620
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,660
Yeah, they wouldn't

621
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,240
want to do that.

622
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I mean...

623
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,820
What the hell?

624
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,600
Why?

625
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,080
Just because a newspaper

626
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,440
or a website

627
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,000
might say something critical?

628
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,240
I thought that was

629
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,980
what it was all about.

630
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,440
I thought that was

631
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,560
what America is all about.

632
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,180
That's not what it's

633
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,760
about anymore.

634
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
What it's about now

635
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,660
is sucking up.

636
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,820
Dave, you can't talk

637
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,720
that way on the radio.

638
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,620
It's like high school

639
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,360
rah-rahs

640
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,080
cheerleading.

641
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,300
Inappropriate.

642
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,380
Inappropriate.

643
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,840
Red light.

644
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,920
That's what they say

645
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,560
where I work.

646
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,440
They say if you start...

647
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,620
If you use a dirty language

648
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,580
or something like that,

649
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
like frown thing,

650
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,720
or something,

651
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:04,980
they go,

652
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,980
red light, red light.

653
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,900
Because we had to watch

654
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,920
a film and we had to

655
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,780
watch a lady

656
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,680
go through all kinds

657
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,420
of weird nervous agitations.

658
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,800
Oh, because...

659
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,840
Because the bad talk

660
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,940
triggered the lady?

661
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,200
Yeah.

662
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,700
Because somebody

663
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,820
was talking bad talk

664
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,580
so she had to come

665
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,140
from corporate.

666
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,680
We had a big meeting.

667
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,060
She put an erectoral

668
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,260
thermometer in her ear.

669
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,460
And she started babbling

670
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,780
all the time.

671
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,160
She had a...

672
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,260
A soup's on carriage

673
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,360
or whatever they call it

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,660
when they bring out

675
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,180
numerous video cameras

676
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,460
and numerous TVs.

677
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
And they were running

678
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,400
all these things

679
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
back and forth.

680
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,220
And remember,

681
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,220
if anyone swears

682
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,860
an awful lot in the room,

683
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,240
say red light

684
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,040
to remind them

685
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,060
to keep their mouth shut

686
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,120
and stuff like that.

687
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,160
Well, Dave,

688
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,680
it's tough

689
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,720
being a special snowflake

690
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,700
and everyone having

691
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,020
to talk special

692
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,980
just around you.

693
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,360
I mean,

694
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,860
I don't mean you.

695
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,740
I mean,

696
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,260
special snowflakes.

697
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Yeah.

698
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,200
You know,

699
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,180
back in the day,

700
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,380
they used to insist

701
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,840
that you talk dirty

702
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,460
and tell race jokes

703
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,240
and smoke

704
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,820
and spit

705
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,780
and drink.

706
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,640
And pray.

707
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,980
And drink at lunch

708
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,240
and also pray.

709
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,140
And now you're not allowed

710
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,760
to do any of those things

711
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,120
pretty much anywhere.

712
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,340
Except everybody still does.

713
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,220
If you look behind

714
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,640
any successful company

715
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,880
or unsuccessful...

716
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,640
Well, there'll be

717
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,300
a whole lot of people

718
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,040
out back smoking.

719
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,120
Mm-hmm.

720
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,760
Tanned.

721
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,080
Yeah.

722
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,320
Healthy looking people.

723
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,680
And or drinking.

724
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,480
Yeah.

725
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,100
And or stuffing things

726
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,880
in their desks

727
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,860
that don't belong there.

728
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Like those weird

729
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,940
little rabbit heads.

730
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,600
Rabbit heads.

731
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,020
Yeah.

732
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,120
Is that what the kids

733
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,700
are doing now?

734
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,360
Rabbit heads?

735
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,780
Rabbit heads.

736
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,280
Yeah.

737
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,140
That's expensive.

738
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,700
God.

739
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,660
Well, I guess rabbits

740
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,740
are the only animals

741
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,480
that aren't about

742
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,400
to become extinct.

743
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,300
Rabbits and pink boys.

744
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah.

745
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,520
Yeah.

746
00:31:59,540 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah.

747
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

748
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,300


749
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


750
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


751
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


752
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


753
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


754
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,340


755
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,960
There's a rabbit track

756
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
near my house in the snow.

757
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,080
And I'm glad to know

758
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,820
that there are still

759
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,640
a few of these.

760
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,420
Yes.

761
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,340
I'm glad to know

762
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,980
that there are still

763
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,840
a few of those little

764
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,720
fuzzy-tailed guys, too.

765
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,020
I'm glad there's a jackdaw

766
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,560
flying over my roof.

767
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,780
A jackdaw?

768
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,940
Arr.

769
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,780
The only true artist

770
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,220
is the jackdaw artist.

771
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Say, Dave,

772
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,500
what do you know

773
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,820
about this new thing

774
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,480
called virtual reality?

775
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
I know you slap

776
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,160
a big old...

777
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,080
thing on your head

778
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,180
and you're suddenly

779
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,160
in an environment,

780
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,820
feely-weely,

781
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,940
I call it in the book,

782
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,340
where you...

783
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,500
you...

784
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,400
you...

785
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
you...

786
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,400
spatially experience

787
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,240
things that can't

788
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,220
be spatially experienced

789
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,700
because it's stimulating

790
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,460
a certain part

791
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,100
of your brain

792
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,660
past your...

793
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,360
past your optic nerves.

794
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,460
Is it safe?

795
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Do I think...

796
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,500
Do you think it's safe?

797
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,700
No, do you think it's safe?

798
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,040
No, do you think it's safe?

799
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,220
I think it's fun.

800
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,320
I just got a set.

801
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
I got a real cheap VR...

802
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,860
Yeah, my...

803
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,020
Well, get this.

804
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,760
I found out

805
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,020
I was ignorant and wrong

806
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,680
because I saw

807
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,580
the Christmas list

808
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,720
for my grandsons

809
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,340
and one of them

810
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,860
wanted this VR headset

811
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,220
and it was only 40 bucks.

812
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,400
And I thought,

813
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
no, virtual reality sets

814
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,540
cost like 500 to 1,000.

815
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,740
The Oculus cost 500 bucks

816
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,960
and a person like me

817
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,480
would have to buy

818
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,240
a whole new computer.

819
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,400
for 500 more

820
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,780
just to run it.

821
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
And I thought,

822
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,620
well, that's got to be

823
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,100
a rip-off

824
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,160
if it's 40 bucks

825
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,020
and you do it.

826
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,700
How do you do it?

827
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,180
And then I did some research.

828
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,000
It's like,

829
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,600
it works with your phone?

830
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,660
And then I was like,

831
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,160
oh, yeah,

832
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
my son tried to tell me this

833
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,780
about this a year ago.

834
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,940
It was called

835
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,320
Google Cardboard

836
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,480
and it actually did work,

837
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,860
but you had to build

838
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,520
your own headset.

839
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,420
Well, this Christmas,

840
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,180
suddenly there's

841
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,040
every company

842
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,640
on the planet

843
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,340
is making

844
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,300
a cheap VR headset

845
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,740
for 15 bucks.

846
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,900
And when I realized that,

847
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,440
well, I read up on it

848
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,720
and realized,

849
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,320
oh, they actually can do VR

850
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,200
because it makes

851
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,100
a little split screen

852
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,840
on your phone

853
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,720
and then the headset

854
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,700
just makes your phone

855
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,340
look big

856
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,980
on each eye separately.

857
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,400
Yeah, everybody needs

858
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,620
to have a big-looking phone,

859
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:24,960
you know.

860
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
I have the biggest phone

861
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,160
in town.

862
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,240
I have a bigger phone

863
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,340
than you do.

864
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,680
No, I don't.

865
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:29,680


866
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,020
no, I don't.

867
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
I promise I have

868
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,040
a bigger phone.

869
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,760
Mine's got more RAM

870
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,900
and ROM

871
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,420
and readout in it, too.

872
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,560
But I only have

873
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,520
one port.

874
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,360
There's only one plug-in.

875
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,060
Yeah, you probably

876
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,120
have more ports than me.

877
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,560
Anyway,

878
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,460
let's get on with this.

879
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,380
Yeah, I tried to,

880
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,940
I found that

881
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,140
I could download

882
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,040
these VR apps,

883
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,060
they call them,

884
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,060
and most of them

885
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,560
are free.

886
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,380
Of course,

887
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,740
then they,

888
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,020
they're free.

889
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,880
You're bombarded

890
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,340
with ads

891
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,400
until you give them

892
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,860
a dollar.

893
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,860
That's where they

894
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,480
make their money.

895
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,140
But it completely

896
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,560
controlled my mind

897
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,240
and made me think

898
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,820
it was fun

899
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,700
and creative

900
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,020
and that a lot of people

901
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,640
had done some real

902
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,900
interesting stuff with it.

903
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,360
So, obviously,

904
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,800
I have already succumbed.

905
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,060
And that was only

906
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,980
the first night.

907
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,120
Obviously.

908
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,220
So, you strapped it on

909
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,700
and what did it do?

910
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,440
I instantly wanted

911
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,920
to fall down on my knees

912
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,720
and worship

913
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,820
an orange-haired,

914
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,760
baboon.

915
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,060
I lost almost all

916
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,900
of my ability

917
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,660
to spell or punctuate.

918
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
I decided that I preferred

919
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,920
simple explanations

920
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,860
to anything complex.

921
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,900
And I realized that

922
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,340
the only real science book

923
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,140
is the Bible.

924
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,160
But yeah,

925
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,160
aside from that,

926
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,860
the VR stuff is really fun.

927
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,260
And I think it's safe

928
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,780
and I don't think

929
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,840
it changes you into,

930
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,720
you know,

931
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,380
I don't think it does

932
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,340
anything to your brain.

933
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,760
I mean,

934
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,620
right?

935
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,440
How would I know now?

936
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,280
Now that I've already

937
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,380
been defected,

938
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,540
I'm not going to...

939
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:04,700
That's the question.

940
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,820
Yeah, I'm not going to

941
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,340
know the difference.

942
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,140
My friends will have

943
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,760
to tell me.

944
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,880
You could have a deviated

945
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,960
septum by now, too.

946
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
Another one of the false...

947
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,380
No, they fixed that.

948
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,940
I had that.

949
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,100
Yeah, they fixed it.

950
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,320
Hear that?

951
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,360
Yeah.

952
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,100
Yeah, man.

953
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,720
That's not deviated at all.

954
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,120
I can suck snot

955
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,960
through both holes

956
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,860
in my nostrils.

957
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,920
Yeah, but if you continue

958
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,980
to go VR,

959
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,160
as you have...

960
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,640
You just discover

961
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,840
that you're feeling

962
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,680
wildly aloof

963
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,540
and full of painful

964
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,060
miscreants

965
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,980
and stuff like that,

966
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,160
it's going to be

967
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,200
pretty easy for you

968
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,840
to all of a sudden

969
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,180
develop a new kind of...

970
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,940
What I just said there.

971
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,640
Addiction.

972
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,440
To the next gimmick.

973
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,640
Yeah, and...

974
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,800
To the Trump glasses

975
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,600
and the Trump hearing aids.

976
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,660
Everything you hear

977
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,880
sounds like the worship

978
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,980
of that great, great man.

979
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,300
That scientist.

980
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,000
Scientific American

981
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
Donald Trump.

982
00:36:59,640 --> 00:36:59,820
Yeah.

983
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,900
He knows more than

984
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,500
all the scientists

985
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,380
put together in the world.

986
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,660
He knows what's in every book,

987
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,820
in every laboratory,

988
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,100
in every library

989
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,940
in the whole world.

990
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,080
And I'll tell you what it is.

991
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,320
Words.

992
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,380
But they don't write good.

993
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
They don't write good anymore.

994
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,980
No, they don't write good.

995
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,540
They don't write good.

996
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,240
Well, you kind of

997
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,420
slipped into his persona

998
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,320
just accidentally

999
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,000
on purpose.

1000
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,960
I told you,

1001
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,580
I've been playing VR games.

1002
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,720
Do you have an orange wig

1003
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,180
as well?

1004
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,420
I don't need one.

1005
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,740
All my hair fell out

1006
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,900
what there was of it.

1007
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,700
And these new little

1008
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,960
orange wispy feathers

1009
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,840
are growing in.

1010
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,380
Yes, and when he takes on

1011
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,000
that persona,

1012
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,700
he gets a virtual orange wig.

1013
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,780
It just pops right out.

1014
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,440
The only thing is

1015
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,060
my hands,

1016
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,860
they're getting tiny and weak.

1017
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,600
I can barely

1018
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,420
jack the car up anymore

1019
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,100
with those tiny hands.

1020
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,260
It's making me frustrated

1021
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,900
and it makes me insecure.

1022
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,160
And when I get insecure

1023
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,740
and angry,

1024
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,200
then I want to dominate everybody.

1025
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,920
And insist on everything

1026
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,800
being my way

1027
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,900
and acting like a big,

1028
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,420
stupid, fat baby.

1029
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,580
But it's okay.

1030
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,660
I've heard,

1031
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,620
I've been told

1032
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,680
on the VR TV

1033
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,980
that it's okay now.

1034
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,940
Oh, you watch the VR TV now?

1035
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,020
Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,940
I watch the VR TV.

1037
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,200
So you're a Breitbart fat baby?

1038
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,820
No, I actually,

1039
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,920
actually they don't,

1040
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,020
they don't offer VR.

1041
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,280
The New York Times,

1042
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,660
of all things,

1043
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,980
has a really good collection

1044
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,240
of virtual reality news

1045
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,620
shows.

1046
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,160
In fact,

1047
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,140
the first one I looked at,

1048
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,580
it was as if

1049
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,880
I was standing

1050
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,660
in the middle

1051
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,700
of a celebration

1052
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,820
at Standing Rock

1053
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,680
and there was a bunch

1054
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,640
of Ogallala people

1055
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,980
singing a big song.

1056
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,580
I was to swivel my head

1057
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,380
around to the back

1058
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,600
and they were behind me.

1059
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,360
I swiveled my way

1060
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,040
to the front

1061
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,180
and they were in front of me.

1062
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,300
And I looked down

1063
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,800
and there was a great big hole

1064
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,040
where the camera tripod

1065
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,080
probably was.

1066
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,260
And everything was fuzzy

1067
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,860
and kind of blurry

1068
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,980
and ill-defined

1069
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,600
because it was,

1070
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,480
yeah,

1071
00:38:59,600 --> 00:38:59,620
it was a,

1072
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,320
it wasn't a,

1073
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,740
I guess,

1074
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,300
I guess it wasn't

1075
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,660
the top-notch camera.

1076
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,840
But there you were

1077
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,580
standing at Standing Rock.

1078
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,580
Yeah, I know.

1079
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,760
But when I stood,

1080
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,600
I,

1081
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,600
and started spinning

1082
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,420
my head around

1083
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,060
while wearing

1084
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,300
these blinders

1085
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,800
and seeing something

1086
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,680
I wasn't really,

1087
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,140
that wasn't really around me.

1088
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,840
Yes.

1089
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,320
I fell over.

1090
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
I was no longer

1091
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,620
standing at Standing Rock.

1092
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,560
I was falling

1093
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,820
in my living room.

1094
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,720
You really fell right over?

1095
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,600
No, I didn't.

1096
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,100
But that,

1097
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm making it,

1098
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm making a gag

1099
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,600
because I think

1100
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,460
that there is this,

1101
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,100
I think the danger

1102
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,960
of VR

1103
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,880
is that you,

1104
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,220
after you've been

1105
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,260
fighting dinosaurs

1106
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,780
and gang members

1107
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,900
in VR

1108
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,740
and driving through walls,

1109
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,360
you get in your real car

1110
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,220
and you,

1111
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,200
you might drive

1112
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,940
into a wall

1113
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,800
because you think

1114
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,440
you can just

1115
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,640
turn off the headphones

1116
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,360
or rewind.

1117
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,480
And the reason I say that

1118
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,380
is because

1119
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,720
as a video editor

1120
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,420
for a hundred years,

1121
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,660
I would go drive home

1122
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,900
from a long day at work

1123
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,280
thinking that way

1124
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,720
that I could just rewind

1125
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,520
because I spent

1126
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,600
a lot of my life

1127
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,340
in a kind of

1128
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,160
virtual reality

1129
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,860
editing video.

1130
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,480
Then,

1131
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,920
about 30 years ago,

1132
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,360
maybe only 25,

1133
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,160
I met this guy

1134
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,620
at a big computer convention

1135
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,800
named Jaron Lanier

1136
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,740
or Lanier.

1137
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
And geeks will know

1138
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,940
that that's the guy

1139
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,400
who was trying to

1140
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,480
trying like hell

1141
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,180
to invent VR back then.

1142
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,940
He and Reverend David Leavitt,

1143
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,260
who was a subgenius,

1144
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,320
was the guy

1145
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,040
who's developing

1146
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,160
the way the audio

1147
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,240
worked in VR.

1148
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
And the problem is

1149
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the audio worked,

1150
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,840
but the video didn't

1151
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,100
until a couple of years ago.

1152
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,240
Well, that's a real

1153
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,100
steak and beans idea,

1154
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:49,880
but you know,

1155
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,940
you know what the corporate

1156
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,120
heads are going to do.

1157
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,460
I mean, not the bodies

1158
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,160
connected to them,

1159
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
but just the heads

1160
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
with the VR devices

1161
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,640
snapped in there.

1162
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,020
They're going to

1163
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,400
produce a video

1164
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,360
to produce a band

1165
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,120
of which we've never seen

1166
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,640
the likes of

1167
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,920
in the last 4,000 years.

1168
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,520
They're going to

1169
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,380
snap down hard on it.

1170
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,160
Or, you know.

1171
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,820
A band?

1172
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,540
A band?

1173
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,040
A band.

1174
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,580
B-A-N.

1175
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,540
Not a band.

1176
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,360
A band of what?

1177
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,680
A band of what?

1178
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,100
Yeah, a band of what?

1179
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,260
What would they ban?

1180
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,940
A band of free materials

1181
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,980
to interact

1182
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,900
and interlace

1183
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,200
with the constant

1184
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
billions of ideas.

1185
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,260
I think you need

1186
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,160
to restate that.

1187
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,820
I think they're going

1188
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,400
to put a band

1189
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,640
on coach and thought.

1190
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,160
Well, Dave,

1191
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,380
television was invented

1192
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,620
decades ago.

1193
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,420
They didn't have to

1194
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,640
put a band on it.

1195
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,720
They know when you're

1196
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,580
not thinking.

1197
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,440
When the television's on, man.

1198
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,940
So 90% of the time

1199
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,820
they don't have to worry

1200
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,620
about anybody.

1201
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,800
There's nothing to ban

1202
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,000
because they're all

1203
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,080
on their butts

1204
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,760
staring into the VR space

1205
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,120
of a TV set

1206
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,640
or their phone

1207
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,400
or the TV set.

1208
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,300
Or the radio set

1209
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,540
that they're looking at

1210
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,040
right now

1211
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,480
as if they could see us talk.

1212
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,960
Thank God they can't.

1213
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,220
I didn't shave.

1214
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,800
I'm like,

1215
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,800
you wore the same dress

1216
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,660
I did, Dave.

1217
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,180
We can't be on TV

1218
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,940
together anymore.

1219
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,400
On one side,

1220
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,360
so I would look

1221
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,200
extra special

1222
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,080
for the ladies

1223
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,800
who are waiting here

1224
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,400
on the show.

1225
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,380
Well, you know,

1226
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,900
sometimes we do have

1227
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,120
an audience on the show.

1228
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,520
It's rare,

1229
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,820
but it does happen

1230
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,580
once in a while.

1231
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,360
At X Day.

1232
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,100
It is rare

1233
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,020
because most of them

1234
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,820
know they're going to hear

1235
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,740
the playback later

1236
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,320
so they go do something else.

1237
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,280
They go fornicate

1238
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,400
with each other in the woods

1239
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,880
while Hal and me

1240
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,040
and whoever else

1241
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,540
goes rattling on and on

1242
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,920
with our brilliant

1243
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,640
smarty pants stuff

1244
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,660
that nobody cares about.

1245
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,820
Well, a lot of people

1246
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,580
come for that

1247
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,440
and they have to get up

1248
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,580
at 6.30 in the morning

1249
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,480
to be able to hear it.

1250
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,460
That's what bothers them.

1251
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,080
No.

1252
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,780
They only have to get up

1253
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,580
at 6.30 in the morning

1254
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,780
to see the saucers

1255
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,900
not show up.

1256
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,900
The shows are

1257
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,140
early.

1258
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,660
No, the shows are...

1259
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:00,980
We...

1260
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,600
Dave,

1261
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,920
you haven't been to an X Day

1262
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,420
in a long time,

1263
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,200
but we don't schedule

1264
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,760
anything before 1 o'clock

1265
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,800
for the simple reason

1266
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,880
that I don't get up

1267
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,160
before 12 o'clock.

1268
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,460
Jase,

1269
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,580
things have changed

1270
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,360
at X Day.

1271
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,860
Yeah, no more bosses, man.

1272
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,460
It's kind of late now.

1273
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,320
It's late.

1274
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,920
It's kind of like,

1275
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,200
oh, the baptism?

1276
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,200
Did I say it was

1277
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,840
going to be at 2?

1278
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,280
Well, let's move that to 3.

1279
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I think maybe 3

1280
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:22,620
would be a little bit better.

1281
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,880
Workers of the world unite.

1282
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,420
Yep.

1283
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,480
But seriously, Dave,

1284
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:26,780
um,

1285
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,720
uh,

1286
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,680
they've already,

1287
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,120
uh,

1288
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,720
they've banned

1289
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,580
sensible,

1290
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,800
rational thought

1291
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,280
in a lot of states

1292
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,160
of the Union.

1293
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,720
Kansas,

1294
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,420
Oklahoma,

1295
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,180
Texas,

1296
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,360
you know,

1297
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,240
the school books,

1298
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:41,720
uh,

1299
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,560
they don't like that.

1300
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:43,660


1301
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,440
They don't, yeah,

1302
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,020
they don't like

1303
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,380
that science stuff anymore.

1304
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,560
That's for the Japs

1305
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,200
or the Arabs

1306
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,300
or the Chinese.

1307
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,540
We're Bible studiers here

1308
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,900
in the South,

1309
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,600
apparently,

1310
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,480
and the Midwest

1311
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,640
and the West.

1312
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,340
And the Northeast

1313
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,100
and the Northwest

1314
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,000
and the Southwest

1315
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
and the Southeast.

1316
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,720
I've seen little heart designs

1317
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,620
from children

1318
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,040
that say,

1319
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,900
Standing Rock,

1320
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,900
we stand with you.

1321
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,740
Isn't that amazing

1322
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,820
to know that

1323
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,080
regular school,

1324
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,120
I'm sure that there are

1325
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,600
many orange baboons

1326
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,260
and we call them

1327
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,820
taught by evil

1328
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,720
liberal teachers.

1329
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,060
Well, all teachers

1330
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,720
are communists.

1331
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,960
Didn't you know that?

1332
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, of course I knew that.

1333
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,060
That's why it's stupid.

1334
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,360
Only stupid people

1335
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,180
go to college

1336
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,860
because then they,

1337
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,220
that turns them

1338
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,100
into communists.

1339
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,700
And, you know,

1340
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,200
all those engineers,

1341
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,320
doctors, scientists,

1342
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
they're all communists now.

1343
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,340
They don't know anything.

1344
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,340
They can't prove

1345
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,300
any of that stuff.

1346
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,600
Science is just a religion.

1347
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,400
They can't prove it.

1348
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,540
They used to think

1349
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,320
the world was flat.

1350
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,720
That's how smart science is.

1351
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,940
Wait a minute.

1352
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,040
I don't think

1353
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,980
any scientist

1354
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,800
ever said

1355
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,840
the world was flat.

1356
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,220
Come to think of it.

1357
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:46,520
Hmm.

1358
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,060
But, you know,

1359
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,720
that's an argument

1360
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,420
they make.

1361
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,720
It's a completely

1362
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,600
false argument.

1363
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,340
It's a lie.

1364
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,900
They make it frequently.

1365
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,380
But it's because

1366
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,680
I don't think

1367
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,540
they understand

1368
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,080
what the word

1369
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,280
science means.

1370
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,680
Literally,

1371
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,140
don't understand

1372
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,040
the meaning

1373
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,200
of the term.

1374
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,500
Nor do they understand

1375
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,560
the meaning

1376
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,460
of the word

1377
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,220
communist

1378
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,960
or

1379
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,020
fascist

1380
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,300
or

1381
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,320
Bob.

1382
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,540
Buh.

1383
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,180
Buh.

1384
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,420
Buh.

1385
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,540
Probably,

1386
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,700
they don't know nothing

1387
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,300
and they

1388
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,560
lax it that way.

1389
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,800
Mm-hmm.

1390
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,460
Mm-hmm.

1391
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,220
So, we'll just

1392
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,780
march on into the future

1393
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,180
as cheerfully as we can

1394
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,360
considering that they're

1395
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,280
about to remove our legs.

1396
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,820
Starting with the little toe

1397
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,520
and just take a little bit

1398
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,580
away at a time.

1399
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,500
Yeah.

1400
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,480
Until we're marching

1401
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,560
on our stumps

1402
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,580
into the future.

1403
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,600
Yeah.

1404
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,140
And finally,

1405
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,140
rolling on little

1406
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,200
motorized chairs,

1407
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,820
but that's what

1408
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,440
half the people

1409
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,300
are doing voluntarily.

1410
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,860
Yeah.

1411
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,640
Go to the supermarket

1412
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,520
and they don't want to

1413
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:57,740
walk.

1414
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,320
Half the people

1415
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,900
have stumps

1416
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,680
and they're sitting

1417
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,100
in little

1418
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,860
electrophonic chairs.

1419
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,840
Yeah.

1420
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,240
Yeah.

1421
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,640
And it's getting

1422
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:07,960
to where

1423
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,600
you can roll along

1424
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,120
in your little

1425
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
electronic chair

1426
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,740
looking at your

1427
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,540
VR phone

1428
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,680
with a headset on

1429
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,720
just bumping into

1430
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,400
other people

1431
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,200
in wheelchairs

1432
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,060
with headsets

1433
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,080
in the supermarket

1434
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,200
with all the stuff

1435
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,240
falling off the shelves

1436
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,720
on you.

1437
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,300
And then you

1438
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,240
kind of drive

1439
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,380
past the laser

1440
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:25,900
uh

1441
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,160
uh

1442
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,040
self-serve

1443
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,400
checkout

1444
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,580
and whatever

1445
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
fell into your

1446
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,700
wheelchair

1447
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,300
you've just bought.

1448
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,320
You mean they don't

1449
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,220
have radar features

1450
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,860
on them

1451
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,460
so it like

1452
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,140
keeps you from

1453
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,160
They'll have to.

1454
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,080
They'll add those

1455
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,780
because that kind of

1456
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,660
thing's getting cheaper.

1457
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,620
Everything that makes

1458
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,460
people stupid

1459
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,040
is getting cheaper.

1460
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,580
And lazy, yes.

1461
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,160
Yeah.

1462
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:47,860
Yeah.

1463
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,040
They call it

1464
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,140
comfort and convenience

1465
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,420
but in actuality

1466
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,320
it's redundancy

1467
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,520
of movement.

1468
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,300
Well, they're not

1469
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:55,860
going to get me.

1470
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,880
They're not going

1471
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,640
to get me either

1472
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,860
because I'm going to

1473
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,920
wear my VR device

1474
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,640
every day.

1475
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,460
They're not going

1476
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,520
to get me through either.

1477
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,600
Actually, they got me

1478
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,540
already because I tried

1479
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,260
on that VR

1480
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,540
that $15 VR headpiece.

1481
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,900
And actually

1482
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,580
what I mostly

1483
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,440
looked at, Dave,

1484
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,120
was cartoons.

1485
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,240
VR cartoons.

1486
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,700
That's understandable.

1487
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,000
But I don't want

1488
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,760
to hear about you

1489
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,460
running off

1490
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,840
crying like a little girl

1491
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,620
into the other room

1492
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,220
with one of those

1493
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:23,980
things on your head

1494
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,300
trying to find

1495
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,600
a sanctum

1496
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,080
that you can

1497
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,700
escape from.

1498
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,160
Escape it to.

1499
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,200
It's too late, man.

1500
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,480
I caught my first

1501
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,860
Pokemon just yesterday.

1502
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,900
I'm not lying either.

1503
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,200
You caught it?

1504
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,060
I caught a Pokemon.

1505
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,300
I caught my first Pokemon.

1506
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,840
He was sitting

1507
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,380
in the kitchen.

1508
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,080
Right on our kitchen

1509
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,480
counter.

1510
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,200
Yep.

1511
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,120
Oh my God.

1512
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,160
But then after that

1513
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,900
I couldn't find

1514
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,500
another one.

1515
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,800
I sucked its soul

1516
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,820
into my phone

1517
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,220
and then the company

1518
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,280
responsible for it

1519
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,860
tried to get me

1520
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,680
to buy something.

1521
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,160
And I haven't seen

1522
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,080
another Pokemon

1523
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,820
since then.

1524
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,320
But it's probably

1525
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,020
because I don't know

1526
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,600
what I'm doing.

1527
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,220
And I'm going to

1528
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:00,720
have to get

1529
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,880
my grandson,

1530
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,560
the six-year-old,

1531
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,480
to show me.

1532
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,740
That's not uncommon.

1533
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,200
Dave, haven't you

1534
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,820
had your grandsires

1535
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,180
show you how to do

1536
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,200
stuff that you don't

1537
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,140
want to know how to do?

1538
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,080
Yeah.

1539
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,740
Quite a bit, in fact.

1540
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,100
Come on, Grandpa.

1541
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,280
Come into this VR room

1542
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,840
and learn how to

1543
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,940
eager nerdba

1544
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,800
with me.

1545
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,980
What?

1546
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,220
Yeah, just put on

1547
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,040
your granddadden

1548
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,560
and eager nerdba

1549
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,200
with me.

1550
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,860
What?

1551
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,580
Huh?

1552
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,560
Grandpa, you're so

1553
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,120
out of it.

1554
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,840
Don't you know

1555
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,780
any goblin labba?

1556
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,040
And that's the way

1557
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,680
it is now.

1558
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,280
Yeah.

1559
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,560
Yep, I've experienced

1560
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,020
that.

1561
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,600
Men flying around

1562
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,380
the moon.

1563
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,980
Yeah, they don't do

1564
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,580
any of that stuff

1565
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,500
like they have to move

1566
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,720
or any of that stuff

1567
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,120
anymore.

1568
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,040
Oh, it's privacy.

1569
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,800
It's privacy.

1570
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:56,800


1571
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:56,800


1572
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:56,800


1573
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:56,800


1574
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:56,800


1575
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,200
Private companies

1576
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,940
do that nowadays.

1577
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,320
The owners of

1578
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,060
private companies

1579
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,480
do that?

1580
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,280
Yeah, private companies

1581
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,780
are trying to get

1582
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,980
people on Mars now.

1583
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,700
There's people

1584
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,040
lining up to go

1585
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,140
die on Mars.

1586
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
I think they were

1587
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,100
going to die before

1588
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,980
they even get inside

1589
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,540
the atmosphere.

1590
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,240
Well, there's not

1591
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,080
much of an atmosphere

1592
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,920
to get inside of.

1593
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,680
Well, no, they can,

1594
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,540
they can, you know,

1595
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,660
you can get a machine

1596
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,100
to Mars and you can

1597
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,020
even get one back

1598
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,840
if you're lucky.

1599
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,140
It's just that

1600
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,340
they haven't solved

1601
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,800
the radio problem.

1602
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,360
It's a radiation problem.

1603
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,120
So you will die.

1604
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,060
Even if you go to Mars

1605
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,120
and come back safely,

1606
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,840
you're going to die

1607
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,520
a little sooner

1608
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,560
because of the

1609
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,800
radiation problem.

1610
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,500
Is radiation a problem?

1611
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,420
In outer space,

1612
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,680
it is a severe,

1613
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,720
severe problem

1614
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,820
because there's nothing

1615
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,840
that can shield you

1616
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,520
from it except

1617
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,780
lead and water.

1618
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,500
And those are

1619
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,120
kind of heavy.

1620
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,840
And they don't

1621
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,580
shield you completely

1622
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,300
because it's real,

1623
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:51,800
real, real, real,

1624
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,180
real strong in outer space.

1625
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:53,940
And the only reason

1626
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,540
it's not real, real,

1627
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,420
real, real strong here

1628
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,020
is because of our

1629
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,760
powerful atmosphere.

1630
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,740
Which is being

1631
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,980
depleted of its

1632
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,660
radiation protective.

1633
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,740
Yeah.

1634
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,120
So we're,

1635
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,300
so it's,

1636
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,060
don't worry about

1637
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,580
those people,

1638
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,000
those idiots going to Mars.

1639
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,680
Everybody's going to die.

1640
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,300
And everybody's

1641
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,900
going to Mars.

1642
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,660
But all the animals

1643
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,440
will die first.

1644
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,720
Then all the people.

1645
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,740
Well, we can make up

1646
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,600
a huge stew,

1647
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,360
a huge non-vegetarian stew.

1648
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,140
Oh, the animals

1649
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,620
will come back.

1650
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,280
Before we shove off.

1651
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,800
But it'll take

1652
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
a long time.

1653
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,900
20 million years.

1654
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,300
Oh.

1655
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,540
I feel so decrepit.

1656
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,820
I'm trying to

1657
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,040
come to an adjunct

1658
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,820
or conjunct

1659
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,500
with many of these

1660
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,520
mysterious theories

1661
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,300
you're propounding.

1662
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,260
And I realize

1663
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,280
that I just haven't

1664
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,000
done my homework.

1665
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,280
I wanted to.

1666
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,380
But I got so darn scared

1667
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,560
sometimes I just

1668
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,120
want to go into a room

1669
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,340
by myself and cry.

1670
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,220
Apparently,

1671
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,860
psychiatrists are

1672
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,100
making a killing

1673
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,800
on the animals.

1674
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,180
On people

1675
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,920
who are feeling that way

1676
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,480
during the last

1677
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,260
month and a half.

1678
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,640
Funny how that happens.

1679
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,760
Ha ha.

1680
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,340
Ha ha.

1681
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,120
Real funny, man.

1682
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah.

1683
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,380
SADS.

1684
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,720
Seasonal Affective Disorder.

1685
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,820
Post-election SADS

1686
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:17,820
are the saddest

1687
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,200
SADS of all.

1688
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,820
It's not funny

1689
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,540
how it happens.

1690
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,280
It's Trumpy

1691
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,940
how it happens.

1692
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,960
Trumpy?

1693
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,600
Yeah, it's Trumpy.

1694
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,280
Everything is so

1695
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,720
Trumped up in this world.

1696
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,020
I just can't stand it.

1697
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
I just feel totally

1698
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,160
Trumped.

1699
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,240
I just want to just

1700
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Trump everything

1701
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,740
and just jump off a bridge.

1702
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,640
You want to

1703
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,620
Trump off a bridge?

1704
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,200
Yeah,

1705
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,800
Trump off a bridge.

1706
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,320
I'd like to give him

1707
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,960
a head noogie

1708
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,700
and mess up his

1709
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,320
yellow, orange hair.

1710
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,340
Oh,

1711
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,240
I'm not going to be

1712
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,200
one of those sad,

1713
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,340
pathetic liberals

1714
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:45,840
who are going,

1715
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,080
no, it must be a lie.

1716
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,840
How could it be?

1717
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,960
Because I was one of those

1718
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,900
angry liberals

1719
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,380
that were going,

1720
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,220
you jerks,

1721
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,000
if you don't get off

1722
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,880
your butts and vote,

1723
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,980
it's going to happen.

1724
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,380
People who never,

1725
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,680
ever voted before,

1726
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,940
are going to vote this time

1727
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,040
because they've never

1728
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
been so upset before

1729
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,740
because they've never

1730
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,320
had so many lies

1731
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,220
thrown at them

1732
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,120
on Twitter

1733
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,920
and Facebook

1734
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,960
and all that.

1735
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,900
That's where news

1736
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,020
comes from now, man.

1737
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah.

1738
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,800
We don't just

1739
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,080
write the news.

1740
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,800
We make it.

1741
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,880
Yep.

1742
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,400
Make.

1743
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,300
Yep.

1744
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,380
You have

1745
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,200
points that were succinct

1746
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,780
and right on the money.

1747
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,100
Well, it was

1748
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,960
William Burroughs.

1749
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,380
It was Burroughs Clark.

1750
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,480
I think.

1751
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,580
Oh, was this from

1752
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,160
Nova Express

1753
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,340
or was it the other one?

1754
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,520
Naked Lunch.

1755
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,440
Naked Lunch.

1756
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,200
When you realize

1757
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,100
what's on the end

1758
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,760
of your fork,

1759
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,880
that little calf

1760
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,920
we raised

1761
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,740
and named

1762
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,740
a tap-tap

1763
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,140
is on the end

1764
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:41,920
of my fork.

1765
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,880
I'm a vegetarian

1766
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,840
from now on.

1767
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,000
Well, till next week.

1768
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,280
Yeah.

1769
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,780
Till the next

1770
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,920
burger floats by.

1771
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,200
In your,

1772
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,000
in your,

1773
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,500
in your

1774
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,480
sacrosanct

1775
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,900
mental abilities,

1776
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,720
which are,

1777
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,620
far from viewable

1778
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,280
right now.

1779
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,600
There's a ban

1780
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,280
on that too.

1781
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,960
A ban on

1782
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,980
sacrosanct

1783
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,040
mental abilities.

1784
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,100
Yeah.

1785
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,300
Yeah.

1786
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,720
If you fashion

1787
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,840
something out of dirt,

1788
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,820
spit on it a few times

1789
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,640
and give it a name,

1790
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,460
you've been

1791
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,420
muted with a lifestyle

1792
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,760
or a possible

1793
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,260
managerial problem.

1794
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:17,740
I've heard

1795
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,780
that's how God did it.

1796
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,480
That's how he done it.

1797
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,220
God

1798
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,900
done it.

1799
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,060
Gosh

1800
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,800
darn it.

1801
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,000
Dad,

1802
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,080
darn it.

1803
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,720
Will,

1804
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:29,920


1805
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,000
really darn it.

1806
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,120
Will dad

1807
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,980
blame it?

1808
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,460
Dad blame it.

1809
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:36,680
Yeah.

1810
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,360
Will heck

1811
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,240
fire it?

1812
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,220
Heck fire.

1813
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,200
Yeah, Dave.

1814
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,020
It's a tough,

1815
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,720
it's getting me

1816
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,480
a tough world

1817
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,900
because it's so cold

1818
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,860
and it's so,

1819
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,760
so wet

1820
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,540
and so hot

1821
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,840
and so dry.

1822
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,920
So confusing.

1823
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,780
We can't complain

1824
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,160
about the weather.

1825
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,480
Everything's so old

1826
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,420
and so new

1827
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,360
and it's just,

1828
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,060
it's all,

1829
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,300
it's all so black

1830
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:05,800
and white.

1831
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,500
Making the complex

1832
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,100
simple.

1833
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,040
Well,

1834
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,680
when,

1835
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,960
when we're recording this,

1836
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,700
it's a week

1837
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,800
before Christmas.

1838
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,920
By the way,

1839
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,220
Dave,

1840
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:24,440
next,

1841
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:24,900
next year,

1842
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,520
we're going to be

1843
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,220
a Eurasian holiday

1844
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:26,660
here.

1845
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,100
It's been

1846
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,120
next week

1847
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,320
will be the

1848
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,500
annual Christmas

1849
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,840
rerun

1850
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,260
because that's what

1851
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,400
Christmas is all about.

1852
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,500
Reruns and presents.

1853
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,380
Beloved reruns

1854
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,660
that you,

1855
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,620
we force them

1856
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,440
to be beloved

1857
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,380
by running them

1858
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,240
every year.

1859
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,620
So,

1860
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,720
it's a wonderful

1861
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,680
hour of slack.

1862
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,840
We'll be on the marathon

1863
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,020
next week

1864
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,160
with the same

1865
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,860
old,

1866
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,600
same old

1867
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,720
Christmas show.

1868
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,840
It's a compilation

1869
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,720
of dozens

1870
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
of Christmas shows

1871
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,840
but it hasn't been

1872
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,580
changed in 15 years

1873
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,920
and that's

1874
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,040
a deliberate move

1875
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,860
on my part.

1876
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,240
I want it to be like

1877
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,100
that Rudolph the Red Nose

1878
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,880
reindeer stop motion special.

1879
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,100
It's terrible

1880
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,800
but everybody loves it

1881
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,620
because it's there

1882
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,520
every year.

1883
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,880
And that's us.

1884
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,700
It's terrible

1885
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,560
but there every year

1886
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:22,940
nonetheless.

1887
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,220
Yeah.

1888
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,900
Reliably bad.

1889
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,640
Oh boy.

1890
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,740
I'm sorry.

1891
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,420
That's us.

1892
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,100
Dave, you sound like

1893
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,060
you're really sick.

1894
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,340
I feel like

1895
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,180
I'm really sick.

1896
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,980
You probably are

1897
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,460
really sick.

1898
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,520
I'm blowing my nose.

1899
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,260
Did you get

1900
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,700
your news shot

1901
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,860
so you'd be inoculated

1902
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,120
against the fake news?

1903
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,420
No, they said

1904
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,020
they were all out.

1905
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,320
Come back tomorrow.

1906
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,260
No, they said

1907
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,320
come back to work tomorrow

1908
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,300
and we'll pay you

1909
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,980
to write some more

1910
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,100
fake news for us.

1911
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,000
No, you don't.

1912
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,860
You're not one of the people.

1913
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,520
You don't get paid

1914
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,940
to write fake news, do you?

1915
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,400
You have the boring

1916
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,220
real news to report on.

1917
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,580
No, if I say something

1918
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,780
that anybody says

1919
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,640
something successful

1920
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,280
or positive,

1921
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,700
I'm accused of

1922
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,120
politicizing an issue.

1923
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,080
Red light.

1924
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,580
Red light.

1925
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,900
Safe word.

1926
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,480
Yep.

1927
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,420
Safe light.

1928
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,020
Red word.

1929
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,680
Red tube.

1930
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,920
Give him some chicken soup.

1931
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,780
He needs some chicken soup.

1932
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,200
Chicken soup.

1933
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,760
Needs some what?

1934
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,780
Chicken soup.

1935
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,540
Chicken soup.

1936
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,680
Dave can't hear you

1937
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,800
as well as everyone else.

1938
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,540
Here's where Dave's ear.

1939
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,020
Dave's ear is over here.

1940
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,300
Oh, I can hear

1941
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,160
chicken soup.

1942
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,300
Chicken soup.

1943
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:41,880
And you poop.

1944
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,340
Poop, poop, poop, poop,

1945
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,220
chicken soup, poop.

1946
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,220
Yang, yang, yang, yang.

1947
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,740
Well, that's pretty ridiculous.

1948
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,820
I hope so.

1949
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,820
It is

1950
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,300
ridiculous

1951
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,760
that makes the world

1952
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,240
go round

1953
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,540
like a sunshiny place.

1954
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,220
Yeah, man.

1955
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,600
It's sunshiny.

1956
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,460
But you know what, Dave?

1957
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,120
You're not going to believe this.

1958
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,700
It's the end of the

1959
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,740
show.

1960
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,100
Well, almost the end

1961
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,540
of the show.

1962
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,400
I don't believe it.

1963
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
So what does that mean?

1964
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,200
That means you don't

1965
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,760
know.

1966
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,400
But, uh,

1967
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,900
there was, there was

1968
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,600
the half hour

1969
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,180
part dedicated

1970
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,360
to his penis.

1971
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,620
And then there's

1972
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,780
the half hour part

1973
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,760
dedicated to

1974
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,440
to our

1975
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:28,800
penis.

1976
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,120
Well, whatever

1977
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,100
we do.

1978
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:33,380
But...

1979
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,020
Small hands

1980
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,060
have big penises.

1981
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,820
Yeah.

1982
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,360
As you know.

1983
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,440
What?

1984
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,640
No.

1985
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,880
I wasn't talking about,

1986
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,560
I wasn't talking about genitals.

1987
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,220
I was talking about

1988
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,240
Reverend Pease

1989
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,420
and the qualities

1990
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,560
of his personality

1991
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,660
which add up

1992
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,320
to penis.

1993
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,540
Yeah.

1994
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,340
Well, if more correctly

1995
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,920
you could say

1996
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,740
a peas-ness.

1997
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,200
But

1998
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,820
that's confusing

1999
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,440
of it.

2000
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
But we're going to have to do it.

2001
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:56,760


2002
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:56,760


2003
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:56,760


2004
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:56,760


2005
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,340
We're going to have to, uh,

2006
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,800
we're going to have to end

2007
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,560
the horrible show now, Dave.

2008
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,220
We really are.

2009
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,080
Well, I'm, I'm sorry

2010
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,280
it was so horrible today

2011
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,440
because I'm, I'm sick.

2012
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,960
No, you sound fine.

2013
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,720
But you didn't sound horrible

2014
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,420
to us.

2015
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,680
Well, no, we like you

2016
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,680
to be sick, Dave.

2017
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,960
That's why we, um,

2018
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,660
well, oh, nothing, nothing.

2019
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,280
It's not,

2020
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,880
you just happen

2021
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,760
to be sick

2022
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,480
by accident.

2023
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,520
It's not like we,

2024
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,860
some conspiracy

2025
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,040
higher-up

2026
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,180
who happens to be

2027
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,720
my boss

2028
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,120
said,

2029
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,420
Dave sounds better

2030
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,540
when he's all sick.

2031
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,120
So, we're going to have

2032
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,020
the boys drop by

2033
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,160
and put some special stuff

2034
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,960
on his toothbrush.

2035
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,680
He'll be sick forever.

2036
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,820
But he'll sound

2037
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,480
a lot funnier

2038
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,120
on your show.

2039
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,000
Actually, I did have

2040
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,700
a thing today

2041
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,780
where somebody left me

2042
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,340
some kind of

2043
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,540
arcane cryptic message

2044
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,540
with a bunch of

2045
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,440
really, really

2046
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,380
beat-up, um,

2047
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,880
um, insulating material.

2048
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,700
It was green.

2049
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,520
And I, I

2050
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,600
couldn't understand.

2051
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,660
I wondered if somebody

2052
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,800
went into my house

2053
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,000
or why they did that.

2054
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,340
What they were trying

2055
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,020
to show me.

2056
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,180
And what it all means,

2057
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,020
I don't know.

2058
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,900
Yeah, they got you

2059
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,840
just where they want you,

2060
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,100
Dave.

2061
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,160
Wondering.

2062
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,440
Fearful.

2063
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,240
Coward.

2064
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,840
Paranoid.

2065
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:08,740
Sick.

2066
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,180
Looking behind chairs

2067
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,100
and under tables

2068
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,080
to see if there's

2069
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,020
inside pencil sharpness.

2070
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,660
Well, you never know

2071
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,260
when there might be

2072
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,340
snakes copulating

2073
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,380
under your couch.

2074
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,280
Although that's probably

2075
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,040
not going to happen

2076
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,640
in winter in Ashtabula.

2077
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,220
That would be a great way

2078
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:25,920
to spend the rest

2079
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,400
of the winter

2080
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:26,740
watching a movie.

2081
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,060
Watching snakes

2082
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,540
copulate under our shoes.

2083
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,000
Move to Arkansas.

2084
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,280
That's all I can say.

2085
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,940
Probably hop, skip,

2086
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,720
and jump away.

2087
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,120
No.

2088
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,600
Yeah, we have to

2089
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,480
end the show, Dave.

2090
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,520
So we're going to say bye,

2091
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,240
but we're not going

2092
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,060
to hang up the phone.

2093
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:41,940
Bye.

2094
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,220
And I just wanted to say

2095
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,220
for those people that,

2096
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,340
uh, the folks at home

2097
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,440
that couldn't make it out,

2098
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,400
uh, to Wisteria,

2099
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,880
to the campsite,

2100
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,600
to the, to the landing pad,

2101
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,240
if you will,

2102
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,180
for X-Day here,

2103
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,260
uh, if you couldn't

2104
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,620
make it out with us,

2105
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,920
to enjoy the festivities

2106
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,680
and be on stage

2107
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,420
with us tonight

2108
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,680
or tomorrow night

2109
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,940
or then, uh,

2110
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,460
well, I mean,

2111
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,460
that's pretty much it, really.

2112
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,660
But if you couldn't

2113
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,160
make it out here

2114
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,920
because you had, like,

2115
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,440
car troubles

2116
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,720
or, you know,

2117
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,480
you got shit going

2118
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,140
on in your family,

2119
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,960
uh, go fuck yourself

2120
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,720
because we all did

2121
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,380
and we were still here.

2122
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:14,620
We're here!

2123
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,060
Fuck peace.

2124
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,080
Fuck peace!

2125
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:21,700
Yeah!

2126
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,300
Yeah!

2127
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,020
Yeah!

2128
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:23,320
Yeah!

2129
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,640
Yeah!

2130
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,240
Yeah!

2131
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,400
Yeah!

2132
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:24,980
Yeah!

2133
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,200
Yeah!

2134
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:25,320


2135
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:25,480


2136
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:25,640
Yeah!

2137
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:25,700


2138
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:25,960
Yeah!

2139
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:26,640
Yeah!

2140
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:26,680
Yeah!

2141
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2142
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2143
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2144
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2145
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2146
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2147
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,680


2148
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,400
I'm sorry.

2149
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,380
I didn't mean to go deep

2150
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:31,920
on that one.

2151
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,360
That was...

2152
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,740
Didn't want to,

2153
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,240
didn't want to get

2154
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,940
the real feels.

2155
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,520
I was getting close.

2156
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,300
I was getting close.

2157
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,260
It's like you're getting touchy.

2158
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,240
Touching some hearts, man.

2159
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,360
Whoa!

2160
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,340
And some eyes.

2161
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,380
It just got squishy.

2162
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,380
Oh, yes.

2163
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,200
I almost forgot.

2164
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,400
Uh,

2165
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:52,700
friends,

2166
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,140
are you a subgenius?

2167
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,620
Minister yet?

2168
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,060
Have you joined

2169
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,400
the church of the subgenius?

2170
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,380
And by that I mean

2171
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,300
actually send in your

2172
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,260
35 bucks

2173
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,260
payable by PayPal

2174
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,380
or credit card

2175
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:09,880
uh,

2176
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,760
on subgenius.com

2177
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,440
where it says

2178
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,740
become an ordained minister

2179
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,260
or where it says stores.

2180
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,420
And even if you have,

2181
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,140
do you have your

2182
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,800
well-made Bob t-shirt

2183
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,620
from anticonformity.com?

2184
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:25,740
Do you have

2185
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,500
your,

2186
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,580
your Arise DVD?

2187
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,760
Sure, you could watch it

2188
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,420
on the internet,

2189
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,060
but

2190
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,320
it's not the same.

2191
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,760
And it isn't the same.

2192
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,700
It hasn't been kissed

2193
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,100
by the lips of Princess Wee

2194
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,260
who kisses every copy of Arise

2195
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,820
that goes out.

2196
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,380
And I sign every copy of

2197
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,500
Book of the Subgenius.

2198
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,480
How about that?

2199
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,240
You can still get those from us.

2200
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,120
But yes,

2201
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,440
the 35 bucks for the minister's pack,

2202
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,380
you really ought to think about it, folks.

2203
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,260
You, you,

2204
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,780
don't have to meet

2205
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,840
any subgeniuses ever,

2206
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,980
but you will have that option.

2207
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,460
You can't come to X Day

2208
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,420
unless you're a member.

2209
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,760
You can't go to the, uh,

2210
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,380
members only, uh,

2211
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,140
kind of smarty pants internet forum

2212
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,160
called Scrub Genius.

2213
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,380
Uh, I, I do a lot more there

2214
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,540
than on Facebook.

2215
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,460
Because Facebook's just a bunch of

2216
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,940
gimme bobs, people who can't even spell

2217
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,680
Bob's name right.

2218
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,860
Do you know that Princess Wee?

2219
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,320
Yeah.

2220
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,520
They can't, they can't even spell

2221
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,740
Bob's name right, half of them.

2222
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,600
They leave off the quotes.

2223
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,200
Oh, yeah, gimme bobs.

2224
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:32,780
You can tell.

2225
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,700
It's so easy to tell.

2226
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,420
Anyway, friends, uh,

2227
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,240
we'll be back next week

2228
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,540
with more X Day recordings

2229
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,720
and hopefully with the Lonesome Cowboy.

2230
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,580
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

2231
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,460
Rotten house old Dammit

2232
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,180
doing over there.

2233
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,680
Dammit, the hound dog's doing fine.

2234
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,580
Well, thank you.

2235
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,020
Good night and praise Bob.

2236
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,060
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya.
