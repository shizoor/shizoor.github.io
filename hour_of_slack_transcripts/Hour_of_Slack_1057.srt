1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,440
Red, you go. Where shall I go? What shall I do?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,580
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a...

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,000
Some genius, our own...

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,300
What?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,280
Whenever you drive the car, there is always an unseen, unwelcome passenger with you.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,400
That passenger is Bob.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,800
What's the matter with Bob?

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,200
Unfortunately, Bob seems to have the absurd, charmed life.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,540
No traffic accident can happen to him.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,000
So when you're behind that wheel, don't obey traffic rules,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,540
but drive the car for life.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,980
Your life and the lives of Bob.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,800
We apologize for the technical difficulties you're currently experiencing.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
If you would like, you can go ahead and pick up the green or the blue pill located under your seat.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,760
This will further enhance the experience for you.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,720
Please be careful when rising from your seat

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,320
and remember to follow the lighted lines along the aisles.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,940
I hope you enjoy your trip.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Thank you very much and bear with us.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,340
We will be taxiing on the runway for just a few moments

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,780
and our flight will begin shortly.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,740
Thank you so much for flying Subgenius Airlines

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,920
and enjoy your trip.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,820
It's like a dripping wet mango.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,540
Slack dripping like an orange, juicy and full.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,660
There we go.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,000
Slack dripping like an orange, juicy and full.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,660
Sorry.

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,800
But you know when you get all that excited.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,880
It's like that.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,780
Ooh.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,760
And please don't forget to wear all the special equipment we've given you

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,340
and quote as many of the silly science fiction phrases,

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,560
like proton pack, nuclear device, weekend whacker,

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,300
and all of the other things that we've been telling you

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,120
as you board the ships.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
If it makes you feel better.

38
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,780
Also remember, after boarding the ships,

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,460
there's a brief moment of unconsciousness called the swoon,

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,420
followed by some indigenous music played by aborigines.

41
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,880
On a didgeridoo.

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,820
And there's the smell of acrid fires burning

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,880
as the Temple of Truth goes up all poo-poo.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,660
A friendly reminder again.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,760
Sack after sack of delicious coffee beans

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,780
will be ground for your delectation and enjoyment.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,360
And for some of you, your bodies will be ground

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,520
and made part of that sample sumptuous ritual.

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,040
Yes, there will be that communication of communion.

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,520
We call it the mingling.

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,120
Ah, yes, dear friends, the mingling.

52
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,060
That was Dr. Howell.

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,860
And last but not least,

54
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, live at X Day 9,

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
the end of the world festival of the Church of the Subgenius.

56
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,960
And this radio episode,

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,640
Hour of Slack number 1057,

58
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,340
is the third of our reports recorded entirely

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,200
at the July 5th week-long festival

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
or at radio stations WCSB in Cleveland

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
and KPFA in Berkeley

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
on the show's website, WCSB.org.

63
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,020
And we're going to talk about the stories

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,180
of the Dr. Sinister and Puzzling Evidence,

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,740
respectively, right after 9X Day.

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,980
And before that little clip,

67
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,760
we heard Priestess Pisces with Five-Fisted Tales of Connie

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,660
and more of that great improv Wotan doctor band also,

69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,300
as well as rants from the young subgeniuses

70
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,860
such as the evocative Popes Pantiera Evacavid.

71
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,840
Evacavid.

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,740
All of these were recorded at Brushwood Folklore Center

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,940
in deep rural New York.

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,800
But don't get the wrong idea.

75
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:06,800
No.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,160
X Day happens everywhere.

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,540
I don't really care.

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,340
It happens all over the whole world.

79
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,020
We just happened to choose Brushwood

80
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,160
as a great place to have a party

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,580
where you can make noise all night long

82
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,200
and nobody cares how weird you get.

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,800
Yeah, I enjoyed that setting a lot.

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,480
And you know what?

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,140
It's always 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998 somewhere.

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,840
Right.

87
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,900
Well, actually, it has never been July 5th, 1998 on this planet yet.

88
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,920
Right.

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,320
We know that.

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,200
It may have been on some other planet.

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,280
Quite a few.

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,840
And we may not be on the planet we think we are on either.

93
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,460
That's right.

94
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,420
Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties.

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,360
If you would, again, bear with us just momentarily.

96
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,680
If you look to your left,

97
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,700
you will notice someone who you probably haven't touched in any way today.

98
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,080
If you look to your right,

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,160
you'll also notice

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,420
a lot of nothing.

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,500
Enjoy the scenery and bear with us.

102
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,420
It'll be a few moments.

103
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,720
So did you give rant and did you go to...

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,740
Oh, yes, I...

105
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,640
What happened to that stank?

106
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,140
Ranting, raving.

107
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,780
Did you go to Stank's house and just rant?

108
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,820
Just walk around the house and rant?

109
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,340
I never...

110
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,240
I was hardly in Stank's house at all

111
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,600
because...

112
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,520
That's how it is in Target City.

113
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,700
...airplane malfunctioned horrendously,

114
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,100
sending me to a hotel...

115
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,060
So near Target City.

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,080
...for two nights in a row in New Jersey,

117
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,520
flying me to Boston, Massachusetts,

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,440
and other places that I didn't need to be.

119
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Are you kidding me?

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,220
I'm not kidding.

121
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
You had to go to some place for two nights in a row

122
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,220
before you even got there?

123
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,420
Yes, and I...

124
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,060
Various flights kept getting canceled

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,960
and finally they couldn't even accommodate me on that airline.

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,280
They took me off and put me on another airline.

127
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,540
Everything's like peewee now.

128
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Was this because you were on, like, you know,

129
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,160
Junior...

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,800
Junior Baba Airlines?

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,120
It had nothing to do with...

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,380
Were you on Ragtag Airlines?

133
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm going to write them a letter

134
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,460
and give them a piece of my mind, I am.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,560
That's no way to treat an airline passenger.

136
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,500
American substandard airways.

137
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,460
They forget about Bob.

138
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,920
Well, now you...

139
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,200
This is all boring.

140
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,620
Yeah, we're forgetting about Bob.

141
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,660
We're talking about airlines.

142
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,480
And the fact is that I did finally make it to...

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Okay, we're checking that.

144
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,800
...the Brechtwood campground.

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,460
...the actual store.

146
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,880
Hey, as you go, airlines.

147
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
We're about to run out of fuel, folks.

148
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,720
We need a little extra cash.

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
A number of rather humiliating or embarrassing pictures

150
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,460
were taken of me and some of the other...

151
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,800
We must look at it.

152
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,940
...this year.

153
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,320
Why?

154
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,700
That Stang has already put into his digital sensorium.

155
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,720
People constantly posed in a grotesque and anti-fascist way.

156
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,580
Can Bob come out to play?

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,420
Can Bob come out to play?

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,060
I saw him the other day.

159
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,980
Can Bob come out to play?

160
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,200
I just want to play a few games.

161
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,920
The kind that make you feel kind of special inside.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,780
Can Bob come out to play?

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,780
Can Bob come out to play?

164
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,540
I really want to play.

165
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,740
Can Bob come out to play?

166
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,500
All right.

167
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,440
Maybe some other day.

168
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,300
Luckily, the Exos portal is scheduled to open.

169
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,060
You know, the two great red spots of Jupiter

170
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,780
are due to collide on July 4th.

171
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,500
And you think you've heard of the worst excedrin headache

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,740
ever.

173
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,820
Friends, these storms, the great red spot, for instance,

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,600
is the size of seven planet Earths lined up together.

175
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,860
They're going to need some cosmic clearasil for this one.

176
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,440
The red junior, as it's called, is approaching the great red spot,

177
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,140
which, by the way, features winds of poisonous, toxic chemicals

178
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,860
350 miles an hour.

179
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,820
Yes, so stop complaining about campground conditions.

180
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,320
Right.

181
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,220
You think you've got it bad here.

182
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,640
Think about those Exos emerging through that portal.

183
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,280
The tang of Earth's oxygen-stuffed atmosphere.

184
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,540
Well, and the tang of the souls Bob's going to be selling those.

185
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,240
The obnoxious organic compounds that have been festering here for millions of years.

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,580
But not your soul friend, because you bought protection

187
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,240
from the greatest insurance agent in the world, Mr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

188
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,260
Consider it a kind of firewall.

189
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,800
Yes.

190
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,860
That's right.

191
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,420
It keeps the bad gods out and keeps your own soul in.

192
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,460
So only Bob can get to it.

193
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,880
Your soul ain't going to be going through anybody's pipe but his.

194
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,180
Oh, he can get to it.

195
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,360
He can get to it all right.

196
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,620
Yeah.

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,820
He really gets to it.

198
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,820
Bob can get to your soul from any, through so many different paths.

199
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,220
Orifices.

200
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,640
Orifices or thoughts.

201
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,140
He can get just through, yeah, through attitudes can open a doorway to Bob.

202
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
You don't have to immediately think.

203
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,760
Think of holes in your body being the way Bob comes in.

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,400
And Bob.

205
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,480
You don't have to smoke Bob.

206
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,920
No.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
You throw yourself into Bob's pipe and let him smoke you.

208
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,920
That's what's in that damn pipe.

209
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
That's what's in his head.

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Look at this.

211
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,400
There's a perfect example is drawn onto my sacred t-shirt here.

212
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
As you can see, Bob is smoking.

213
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:52,820
Well, actually this brain, that's you, is using the bowl of Bob's pipe to smoke his brain,

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,360
which has been lit.

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,580
And is on fire.

216
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:03,140
We would consider this a symbiosis, a mutually benevolent relationship between the operator

217
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,460
and the patient.

218
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,460
Well, let's reveal more subgenius wonders here.

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,460
And by the way, when I left for parts unknown to Hobnob and otherwise Flapjack and Jim Jam

220
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,340
with my brother wizards, there was a little secret.

221
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,340


222
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,400
There was a little red spot on the planet Jupiter moving toward the big red spot.

223
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,780
And what happened?

224
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,780
We were out of touch.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,220
There was an overcast sky, even though we had a telescope.

226
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,180
We were given those instructions to forget about that.

227
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,840
It's a conspiracy.

228
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,340
Now, according to some apocalyptic.

229
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,180
You obviously didn't get the instructions.

230
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,340
They said that what was supposed to happen is when the little irritating red spot met

231
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,500
the great red spot.

232
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,700
That's a great movie, Duma.

233
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,320
There would be a battle of words.

234
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,840
There was a little red spots that was beyond all conception.

235
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,580
No, Stang said a million monoliths like in 2001 would come out of that convergence.

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,680
The tiny red spot was completely the underdog in this battle.

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,400
There would be the million monoliths.

238
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,320
In this Goliath versus David.

239
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,660
Well, however you explain it in allegorical or scientific form, we didn't know what happened.

240
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,500
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

241
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,680
You know what happened to Goliath, right?

242
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,800
Rocknar walking through camp saying, hey, guess what?

243
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
We're at war with Korea.

244
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,700
Wristbands.

245
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:40,060
We ran out of the X wristbands this year, which we thought was significant.

246
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:50,120
Another thing that was significant is that a fog rolled in just as we were looking through the telescope at Jupiter and saw the big storms lining up.

247
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,120
I missed that.

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
I wanted to see the telescope.

249
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,420
Yeah, of course you missed it.

250
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,140
There was a fog.

251
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,640
And conspiracy, of course, won't talk about what happened.

252
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:06,780
But I saw the million monolith march begin as all those 2001 monoliths emerged from that vortex, crisscrossed like Xs.

253
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,720
It really happened.

254
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,560
But we didn't have a way.

255
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,580
There was no way to, like, photograph it through the little telescope.

256
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,680
And then the fog covered everything.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,860
And then the zombies came.

258
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,080


259
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah.

260
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,540
You know, there were actually, were you there when the zombies came out during that rave?

261
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,500
I encountered a few of the zombies left over after the initial massacre.

262
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,940
We had to, I ended up having to hack a few.

263
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:42,980
That was the most amazing zombie attack because first they came lurching out of the woods, friends of ours, former subgeniuses now looking like Romero zombies.

264
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,940
And they grabbed various dancers at the rave who were so high they couldn't, they didn't know what they were doing.

265
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,360
The zombies would bite them on the neck and drag them away.

266
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,560
And then those people they'd bitten would come back.

267
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,920
So after the first wave of zombies, there was a whole second wave of zombies.

268
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,860
You know, I always come prepared for potential zombie attacks.

269
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,080
When I go to X-Day, I probably never really told anybody that before.

270
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,380
But it's always been a sneaking suspicion that it was going to happen one of these days.

271
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,980
And I'm glad I was prepared this time.

272
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,520
Now, why couldn't you have set your camera up by the other end of the drive-in stage?

273
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
And you could have caught this.

274
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,360
This image of those Romero zombies just shambling towards the drive-in.

275
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,240
They come out of the screen.

276
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah.

277
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,900
It's so horrifying.

278
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,660
It's so realistic.

279
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,980
The zombies will come right out of the screen.

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980
There are slack angels.

281
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,960
There are slack demons.

282
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,040
They give and they take.

283
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,840
And my soul aches.

284
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,800
helecton支持我

285
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:19,860
my soul aches.

286
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
Fuck liberty.

287
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,360
Fuck death.

288
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,660
Give me slack.

289
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,320
I need it.

290
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,620
I need it like I need my breath.

291
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,680
What about me, Bob?

292
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,140
What about me?

293
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm lost, a slackless child

294
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,620
in a sea of the conspiracy.

295
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,620
What about me, Bob?

296
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,120
What about me?

297
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,360
A lost child

298
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,700
in a slackless conspiracy.

299
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,940
No.

300
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,040
No.

301
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,540
No.

302
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,460
No.

303
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,960
No.

304
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
No.

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
No.

306
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,360


307
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,080
No.

308
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,820
No.

309
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:12,920
Take me away, take me away from it.

310
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,980
Next day, take me away from it.

311
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,920
Take me away, take me away.

312
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,720
I've been bled dry.

313
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,280
I've been ostracized.

314
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,900
Sermonized.

315
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,620
I've been bled dry.

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,220
Because, well, I'm out of money and I don't know what I'm going to do after this.

317
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,480
Well, you could take a break. I could sing my X-Day song.

318
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,360
So sweet and delightful.

319
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:02,040
I sang it for Ivan Stang and I sang it for the bewildered bobbies from the stage.

320
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,360
And then I told them, what?

321
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,320
What?

322
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,660
Well, if that don't fit at all.

323
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,480
Well, I've got the one I did, so I could do that one.

324
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh, your song?

325
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,460
Yeah.

326
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,000
Whip it out.

327
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,380
All right. I'm going to...

328
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,780
Not that! The song!

329
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,840
Too late.

330
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,840
The X-Day song that I wrote in the airport.

331
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,100
I had to circle around and around forever thinking I would actually never get here.

332
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,760
X-Day is here.

333
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,280
The mountains fall.

334
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,340
I cringe and hide my head.

335
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,940
I never send in my thirty bucks.

336
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,580
My soul is filled with dread.

337
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,780
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

338
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,460
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

339
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship.

340
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,540
To my subgenius home.

341
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,520
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship.

342
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,960
To my subgenius home.

343
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,240
I laughed at Bob.

344
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,340
Ah, woe is me.

345
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,820
I thirst for slack in vain.

346
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
Now he still grins and smokes his pipe.

347
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,900
I must have been insane.

348
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,440
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

349
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,220
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

350
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship.

351
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,940
To my subgenius home.

352
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,300
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship.

353
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,700
To my subgenius home.

354
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,880
I saw the people of the world.

355
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,300
They were the saints.

356
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,260
And normals flee.

357
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,780
The dreadful harvest from the sky.

358
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,340
They perish like the melting snow.

359
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Yet not a one knows why.

360
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,680
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

361
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,240
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

362
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,560
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship.

363
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,920
To my subgenius home.

364
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,200
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship.

365
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,540
To my subgenius home.

366
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,700
The towers of the proud did fall.

367
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,260
There was no shelter from that storm.

368
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,460
While far above.

369
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,840
Subgeniuses watched.

370
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,260
In comfort safe and warm.

371
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,160
It was a dream.

372
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,240
But then I woke.

373
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,700
The rupture still can be mine.

374
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,700
I wrote out a check to Ivan Stang.

375
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,420
Now Bob's grin seems benign.

376
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,780
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

377
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,440
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

378
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucer ship.

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,900
To my subgenius home.

380
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,480
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship.

381
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,840
To my subgenius home.

382
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,140
Oh, that's so beautiful.

383
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,060
There, there.

384
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,640
It's all right.

385
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,060
I think I bite my grandpa.

386
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,360
He's a good boy.

387
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,360


388
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,360


389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,360


390
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,540
He used to sing that to me back long years before you even wrote that song.

391
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,440
Yes, I know.

392
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:16,280
Well, you see, in the bosom of the people, the simple-minded faith in Bob persists.

393
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,240
The gap-toothed credulity which supports Bob and all his works.

394
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,180
It comes from the horny-handed sons of the soil, the salt of the earth,

395
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,280
the pepper who've been mustered in the ranks and legions on the great day.

396
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,180
Hallelujah, Gobble.

397
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,540
You sure got a pretty mouth, Dr. Howe.

398
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,180
I'm not sure I like to hear that kind of language in this here rural setting.

399
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:51,780
But we have much to explain and explicate of the many wonderful and notable works and wonders of Bob.

400
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,820
Yes, this is me, Bernard.

401
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:04,180
I just wanted to call, you know, as I speak, you know, the UFOs are appearing outside.

402
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,160
Yes.

403
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,500
They're outside the window again today, the 5th of July.

404
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,620
And, you know, sometimes when they do appear, like, other lights start flashing on and off of them,

405
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:23,440
like these newly, like this newly built house, like these newly built houses right next by this house that I'm living in.

406
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Sometimes the lights flash on and off when they appear or don't appear.

407
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,500
The UFOs have come back.

408
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,480
They're outside my window as I speak.

409
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
I can see them.

410
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,880
I hope it means that it's, that X Day is coming.

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh, by the way, speaking of burnings, the potluck dinner is tomorrow.

412
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,360
Obviously, it's a little late for it now.

413
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,380
So, I know some people are leaving.

414
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,440
That means you have to give us your food.

415
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You don't get any of ours.

416
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm sorry.

417
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,940
Probably next year it will be the other way around.

418
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,400
Next year.

419
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
See, listen, how I automatically make these assumptions.

420
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:19,740
I've been so used to doing X Days that it turned out to just be drills that I make an ass out of Bob and me by assuming that this might be another drill.

421
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,940
But I don't see any reason to be assuming anything.

422
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,060
We can't assume that this is the year 2006.

423
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,080
We can't assume that this is the planet Earth.

424
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,160
We can only assume that J.R. Bob Dobbs is here.

425
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,820
And it's him who was foretold.

426
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:49,720
Now, here's a poem by young Reverend Nenslow, age seven, from Portland, Oregon.

427
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,720
You might want to read it.

428
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,760
It's kind of long.

429
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,920
You might want to read some of it.

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,360
Good God.

431
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,220
It's a Nenslow poem of endless verses.

432
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,940
Well, it's a next day poem, though.

433
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm filled with anticipation.

434
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,060
As I wait to go away.

435
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
I'm going home to planet X.

436
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,340
For it's X Day today.

437
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,840
My life is put on hold as I throw away my past.

438
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,640
I can't go on with my life.

439
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,160
I give in to my fears at last.

440
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,860
I never tried to chase a rainbow.

441
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,740
Or tried to live a dream.

442
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,240
I made very few mistakes.

443
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,780
My heart was right, it seemed.

444
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
Never wanted to be somebody.

445
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,040
Just a soul, just passing by.

446
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,300
I had no grandiose vision.

447
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Was not aiming for the sky.

448
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,040
But Bob had other plans for me.

449
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,440
He yanked my feet up off the ground.

450
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,160
He said, if you want to serve me, then take a look around.

451
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,760
You see, there are many people in this stupid world, you know.

452
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,400
And it's up to you to tell them exactly where to go.

453
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,260
So you made a few mistakes, as oh so many do.

454
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,060
But if you can send me thirty bucks, I can still use you.

455
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,980
Exalt yourself and tell them of the mistakes that they have made.

456
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,820
Then tell them of my smiling face.

457
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,620
And the price that you have paid.

458
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,420
I will sell you purpose, provision, and a name.

459
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,220
Your life will be confusing.

460
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
It will never be the same.

461
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,360
I have never been right here with you.

462
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,780
Even when life was hard.

463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,220
I knew you couldn't make it.

464
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,740
I knew it from the start.

465
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,620
So keep on calling my name whenever you need a hand.

466
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,340
And your dollars you must send to me as countless as the sand.

467
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,300
I always will forsake you.

468
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,660
I will always leave you cold.

469
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,180
Especially when you make mistakes and are growing very old.

470
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,620
Now take my words and tell them.

471
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,160
And tell your friends of the message that I gave.

472
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,500
And be my witness to the world.

473
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,380
And dig your fucking grave.

474
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,260
Reverend Nenslow, age six.

475
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Yes, that young man shows great promise in the poetic department.

476
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,000
And you know his poos make better dobs heads than the ones that little Vredes paints.

477
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,900
I know, it really drives him insane too.

478
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,260
It's good when he's saying that.

479
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,940
I think he's slaving here.

480
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,540
This is where the ex-

481
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,300
The UFOs are showing up.

482
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,140
Much like this show.

483
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Hero shot.

484
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,220
Yeah, they're staying.

485
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,060
He's waving at the screen.

486
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,360
Oh, I thought that was his hair.

487
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,220
And this is Sister Decadence.

488
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,320
There's Ragnar's new girlfriend, an exotic dancer.

489
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,920
And he's already pregnant.

490
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,580
Look at this incredible shot here.

491
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,220
Did she bring, did Ragnar bring her this year?

492
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,100
These are the Kentucky subs.

493
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,000
And these are, this guy here has his hair dyed pink.

494
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,500
And he, and well.

495
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,060
I thought that was Scream Master.

496
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,340
No, that was a different matter.

497
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,440
These are the old Kentucky subs.

498
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,340
Where the birds make music all the day.

499
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,720
They're screaming all over the place.

500
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,600
So what kind of camps are there?

501
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,060
I mean there's Doc Prop's camp of course.

502
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,980
Well, Doc Prop's camp is under the trees.

503
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,420
It's all spread out into different rooms and things.

504
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,760
Oh, okay.

505
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,580
And others are right up there in the main drag on the hill.

506
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,460
That's where the subgenius youths are.

507
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,020
And for the first time we saw 18 year old Pantiera Evolkovich.

508
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,820
She's like Bjork.

509
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,840
Who had written on alt-slack but now appeared in person.

510
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,960
And was personally baptized by me and Ivan Slade.

511
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,860
When we did the Bob-tism this year.

512
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,320
Yes.

513
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,640
Now was she your personal bed warmer this year?

514
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,060
Not at all.

515
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,620
She stuck to her own side of the camp.

516
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,400
I hardly exchanged a few words with her.

517
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,300
That's a shame.

518
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,720
I did talk to her at the end though about a couple of things.

519
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,640
It was rather interesting.

520
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:14,400
She gave some interesting testimony one night at the ranting and raving screeching scream-a-thon for Bob.

521
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,140
Oh, now we got a view.

522
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,780
Someone step to the microphone and tell us what has Bob done to you?

523
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,460
What do the pinks mean to you?

524
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,260
The popes.

525
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,600
Ah.

526
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,760
Reverend Pantiera.

527
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,900
You want to know what Bob did to me?

528
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,760
Yes.

529
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,560
He fucked me in the ass and gave me inspiration.

530
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,720
And you know what?

531
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,480
That's even doubly weird because Bob is our father.

532
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,840
Bob is the father of all of us.

533
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
Praise Bob!

534
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,900
He has magical sperm.

535
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,800
Yes, he does.

536
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,060
It's the gargoyle.

537
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,980
Praise Ben Spermian.

538
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,160
Woo!

539
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,220
You're saying Mom fucked my mom?

540
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,380
Yes.

541
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,080
Praise the holy sperm.

542
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,360
I'm afraid so.

543
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:03,580
Your mom is a whore?

544
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,720
Yeah.

545
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,200
Who hasn't fucked your mom?

546
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,700
Even I fucked your mom.

547
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,840
I don't even know who she is.

548
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,880
Praise Bob the juice-guzzling whore!

549
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,020
Yay!

550
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,460
Yay, Mom.

551
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,160
Everybody needs a father.

552
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,880
Not because fathers necessarily love you and teach you how to play catch.

553
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,580
Bob isn't that kind of a father.

554
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,120
All my father ever did was smack me around.

555
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,460
That's exactly.

556
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,520
Woo!

557
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,840
Bob takes off the belt whenever you sneeze and he says,

558
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,420
Shut up!

559
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,680
Catch!

560
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,260
Woo!

561
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,820
Get off my freaking lawn.

562
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,300
Get back into the class.

563
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,740
Pass.

564
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,980
Pass your phone.

565
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,940
Get back into the sweatshop and make me my shoes.

566
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,140
Woo!

567
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,340
Get your own sister.

568
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,820
But, but, as neglectful and hateful as Bob may be.

569
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:56,960
You said but.

570
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,060
I said but.

571
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,400
That was funny.

572
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,780
As neglectful and hateful as Bob as a father may be.

573
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,680
Don't mind me.

574
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,900
I'll just kick in every once in a while.

575
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,520
He's still, he's still our father.

576
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,960
And he taught us everything we know.

577
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,260
And we are just as fucked up as him.

578
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,120
Yeah!

579
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,060
We deserve to kill him whenever we feel like it.

580
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,060
Not in Dallas, not with a sniper rifle,

581
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,080
while he's in a convertible waving at people.

582
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,060
We need to kill him.

583
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,780
While he's on the shitter.

584
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,620
Exactly.

585
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,420
For no reason.

586
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,160
While he's hanging behind his face.

587
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,280
Oh, fuck!

588
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,860
Kill him! Kill him!

589
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,960
Kill him!

590
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,260
Kill Bob!

591
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,620
Bob!

592
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,100
He deserves death!

593
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,380
Fuck his face!

594
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,820
I hate you, Daddy!

595
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,240
I hate you, Daddy!

596
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,660
What's about?

597
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,480
Anybody else want the mic?

598
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,080
What has Bob done to you?

599
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,580
Bob has fucked us all up.

600
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,140
He took all of us.

601
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,140
He pulled all the internal batteries out of my smoke detectors.

602
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,600
Thank you, Bob.

603
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,100
But how would he know?

604
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,400
Would we still have to thank him for my mom?

605
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,640
He doesn't know. He just doesn't care!

606
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,740
He peed in my beer!

607
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,320
No, I think you did that!

608
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,260
Bob taught me hate.

609
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,580
Exactly!

610
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,240
That's what Bob does as a father, he teaches us how to hate because he hates us so fucking much it makes us hate him.

611
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,720
Yeah.

612
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,380
For $30.

613
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,300
Exactly.

614
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,920
Yeah, we still have to pay him.

615
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,180
Bob is the cigarette butt that you cannot piss down the drain no matter how hard you

616
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,600
try.

617
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,000
Bob will not go down.

618
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,920
Bob is not going to go down until he's ready.

619
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,380
No.

620
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,060
Bob is the turd that will not go down the toilet.

621
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,060
Bob will not be on your shoulders.

622
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,940
But your slack is the plunger.

623
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,060
Exactly.

624
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,060
You have to rise above what your father Bob taught you with slack.

625
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,980
But he taught you that too.

626
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,060
He taught you how to enjoy having time off and not giving a shit about pinks.

627
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,960
Because he didn't give a shit.

628
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,640
And look at him.

629
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,420
He's an asshole.

630
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,420
He is an asshole.

631
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,960
We have to be assholes too.

632
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,580
That's why we made television.

633
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,400
That's easy.

634
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,920
You had us.

635
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,040
You had us.

636
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,300
You had us.

637
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,640
Go ahead.

638
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,140
Mine is done.

639
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Thank you very much.

640
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,180
Let's get a round of applause for him.

641
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,580
It's a little fuzzy owl.

642
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,940
Apparently they use carrier pigeon to communicate with the outside world from X Day.

643
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,440
Oh yeah.

644
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,580
And the carrier, and the pigeons are trained to.

645
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,180
Are they my pigeons?

646
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,440
And then they have those, what?

647
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,760
Those subgeniuses that sit on the bridge and shoot the pigeons.

648
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,780
I don't even know.

649
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:06,780


650
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:06,780


651
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,860
I wondered why they disappear for one week and then.

652
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,040
And they're trained to go.

653
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


654
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


655
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


656
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


657
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


658
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


659
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


660
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,620
They're trained to kind of be able to get away from the rotten UFO blast as it leaves

661
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:14,960
the earth.

662
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,840
There's where the birds wobble sweet in the springtime.

663
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,660
They're cool like that.

664
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,760
My pigeons.

665
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,640
There's where those old carrier pigeons long to go.

666
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,780
Hey there.

667
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,200
Hi.

668
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,780
Hey there.

669
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,860
Did you bring the supplies?

670
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,780
Hey good looking.

671
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,100
Did you bring the quote supplies unquote?

672
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,840
How about cooking something up with me?

673
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:36,900
That's good.

674
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,020
Dibble dibble.

675
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,660
Are you fellas ready?

676
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,020
I got a good idea.

677
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


678
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


679
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


680
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


681
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


682
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


683
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,020


684
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm ready to go.

685
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm ready to go.

686
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,760
Well, when you gotta go.

687
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,620
You just got here.

688
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,080
There she goes.

689
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,620
That's the only thing we can say.

690
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,340
You just got here.

691
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,740
You only got here long enough to tell us you had to go.

692
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:47,860
There she goes.

693
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,720
All dressed up in her Sunday clothes.

694
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,920
That just isn't right.

695
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,040
You know, I hate it when you're sitting in your house and then your friend just sticks

696
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,660
their hand in the door and goes, gotta go.

697
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,040
See ya.

698
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
She was a UFO person.

699
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,540
She was checking to see if we believe the world is over.

700
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,880
Well, it depends on what your definition of over means.

701
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,020
Well, I'm not sure.

702
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


703
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


704
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


705
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


706
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,020


707
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,540
I mean, cause I'm over it.

708
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,680
Do you mean over like?

709
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
Yeah, she's over the end of the world.

710
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm over.

711
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,340
Yeah.

712
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm like floating right now.

713
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,900
We're completely over, dude.

714
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,420
What?

715
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,580
You guys are gonna, you're gonna come out here into space?

716
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,340
We've made it over.

717
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,000
And you're not gonna, you're not gonna go into space?

718
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,520
We're on the other side now.

719
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Hey, yeah.

720
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,160
We don't need to go into space because we're already on the other side.

721
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,020
Yep, we are the other side, folks.

722
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,040
You're listening to the show from the other side of the end of the world.

723
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,000
Wait, isn't Karen already the other side?

724
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000


725
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000


726
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000


727
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000


728
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,780
Yeah, there is, yeah.

729
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,020
Thank you for calling the Slack Crisis Line.

730
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,440
We appreciate you holding.

731
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,580
A representative will be with you very shortly.

732
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,000
Please hold.

733
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,720
We appreciate you holding.

734
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,320
I don't have any Slack Princess Pisces.

735
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,280
There's like way too many Slackful people here.

736
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,460
I don't have any Slack.

737
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,980
How can I help your Slack Crises?

738
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,080
I work for Bob.

739
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,560
You work for Bob, I understand.

740
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah, and I have to do all this stuff.

741
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,820
I thought it was all gonna be creative, but I ended my, I spent my time making membership

742
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,540
packs and typing in credit cards.

743
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:33,700
Yeah.

744
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm not gonna be making any numbers.

745
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,400
I'd probably be making more money if I worked for my dad or something if my dad had a job,

746
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,220
but I just don't have any Slack.

747
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,120
Calm down.

748
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,780
Calm down, sir.

749
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,020
We're here to help.

750
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,220
Let's see what we can do about this situation.

751
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,300
So if I got you right, and just correct me if I'm wrong, the problem seems to stem from

752
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,160
the fact that it's all work and no Slack for you.

753
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,960
Is that correct?

754
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,740
Yeah, that's right.

755
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,700
And nobody will help me.

756
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,460
Nobody will help me wipe my butt either.

757
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,580
I have to do everything myself, including wipe my ass.

758
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,380
I understand.

759
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,420
We do have a solution for you, sir.

760
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,520
How much is it?

761
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,500
They always want a lot of money for that kind of stuff.

762
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,460
Sir, the solution is only $30.

763
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,820
Then it must be a rip off, because it should be like $300,000 or it probably doesn't work.

764
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,740
Oh, no, sir.

765
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,660
It is a $30 cost with eternal salvation guarantee.

766
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,900
Oh, man.

767
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,720
That's like giving it away for free.

768
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,940
Why would anybody get everything they ever wanted in their whole life just for $30?

769
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
That doesn't make any sense.

770
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:59,040
Well, you see, sir, we had gotten a package deal on Slack many years ago in an auction.

771
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,460
Because of this package deal, we are able to turn the savings over to you.

772
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,100
You mean I can get Slack for cheaper?

773
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,600
Well, even if I don't need it, I'll buy it then.

774
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,460
Absolutely, sir.

775
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,900
Now, if you'll just bear with me, what I'm going to do is go ahead and verify your information here.

776
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,140
It will be one moment.

777
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,340
Let me get into the system.

778
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,260
Okay, sir.

779
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,020
I do show that you are still located at the address.

780
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,660
Yeah, that's it.

781
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,760
Okay.

782
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,580
We'll be sending someone out to pick you up shortly.

783
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,700
Be warned, though, sir.

784
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,780
Don't be startled.

785
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,500
What is coming for you is not a traditional mode of transportation.

786
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,200
It will be a large flying saucer.

787
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,800
That's what they said in the last cult I joined.

788
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,540
Basically, the flying saucer will be arriving at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

789
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,500
Do be prepared.

790
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,640
There will be no second chances to arrive on this saucer.

791
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,840
I feel like I'd be a stupid idiot to believe any of this bullshit, though.

792
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,100
I'm just so lost.

793
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,600
Bob, it's too good to be true.

794
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
I understand your feelings.

795
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,340
I understand your concerns, and I certainly feel those.

796
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,020
The psychologist charged $30,000.

797
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,200
That's got to be more worth it.

798
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,200
More worth it to you?

799
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,680
Sure.

800
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,980
Something that's only $30, that's only worth $30.

801
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:41,040
But the question is, if you really could get eternal salvation for $30, why not take it?

802
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,500
But I won't get eternal salvation until I'm dead, man.

803
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,020
It's tripling your money back.

804
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,140
Oh, in that case, sure.

805
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,060
Okay, all right.

806
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,240
Okay, sir.

807
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,420
Again, the saucers will be picking you up at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

808
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,180
Your confirmation number will be...

809
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,260
The number for this order is 13013.

810
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,100
I do want to let you know that clothing is optional for your arrival.

811
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,880
Whoa.

812
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,220
Even for chicks?

813
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,660
There will be females of your species available on this trip.

814
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,180
Whoa.

815
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,780
.

816
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,540
.

817
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,020
.

818
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,800
.

819
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:34,800


820
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:34,980
.

821
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,040
.

822
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,520
.

823
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,540
.

824
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:35,560
.

825
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,380
.

826
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,440
.

827
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,520
.

828
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,520
.

829
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,420
.

830
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,420


831
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,420


832
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,420


833
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,420


834
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,420


835
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,460
.

836
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:49,560
.

837
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,600
.

838
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:50,740
.

839
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:50,820
.

840
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,480
.

841
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,960
you're going to that special site I see that always calms you down and stimulates your red

842
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,740
corpuscles. I'm always much happier if I'm trying to fix a machine. Yeah. I can't fix people. Right.

843
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:14,260
Well, I mean, I've learned a long time ago, you don't try to fix people. You can sometimes exploit

844
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:22,340
their sickness or their disease or their weakness or their strength, even if you can find any

845
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:30,020
I'm sorry if I sound a little bitter, but I've been to this is the 11th X Day.

846
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:38,300
And I'm getting tired of this shit. If Bob doesn't come through this time, and please folks,

847
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,120
don't say Reverend Stang. How come the X's didn't show up? I've gotten real tired of that.

848
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,020
I'm not. Do you see a pipe in my mouth, friends? Do you? Not right now. I mean,

849
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,260
sometimes.

850
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,740
Sometimes, yeah, sure. But not, you know what I mean. Do you see dots on my face? Yeah,

851
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
but you know what I mean.

852
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,560
It's funny, when you put your glasses on, those dots get into even stronger focus. So

853
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,300
maybe they really are there.

854
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,040
No, it's not like Clark Kent and Superman. I mean, you could tell that was Superman with

855
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,880
glasses on.

856
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,860
Could you, though? You know, you...

857
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,720
If you weren't a dumbass, luckily he worked with reporters at a big city newspaper.

858
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,080
You're a dumbass because you're a human. But he's a Superman. You see, this, remember,

859
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:33,240
is being depicted by humans, not Superman. It's being depicted in crude, four-color comic

860
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,160
book colors. But the thing about Superman is that he must...

861
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,380
Oh, did they do a comic book of the movie? Wow!

862
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,660
Well, no doubt they will. But the thing about Superman is that he has to dumb himself

863
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,700
down. He has to do an elaborate act to be a human. And that was the major difference

864
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,180
between Superman and Superman.

865
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,880
I kind of know how he feels, only it's in reverse.

866
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,440
Well, that was why Superman appeals to so many people because they think, yeah, I'm

867
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,140
not Clark Kent. I'm really Superman. That's the thing about him. Say, compared to another

868
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,640
superhero, like Billy Batson is wandering through the sewer and he suddenly meets some

869
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,500
old geezer who gives him the special word, which he will say and turn into Captain Marvel.

870
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,500
But he's really Billy Batson, crippled newsboy, who only occasionally turns into the big red

871
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,580
cheese captain.

872
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,580
Captain Marvel. Batman puts on a suit. He's really Bruce Wayne, but he puts on a suit

873
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:32,880
and becomes a Batman. But Superman really is Superman. He puts on a suit and becomes

874
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,960
the normal guy. The normal identity is the put on. The secret identity is not the real

875
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:48,080
identity, which is the super guy in the underwear. And he has to pull his punches to live on

876
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,500
the earth without destroying everyone in it.

877
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,840
I remember an old Superman comic I read as a kid. He flew millions of miles out into

878
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,400
space just to sneeze and he destroyed a whole solar system. Did you see that one? Well,

879
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,820
I remember reading it. Planets went tumbling this way and that. When Superman hits the

880
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,780
bad guy, do you think he's not pulling his punch? He'd splash that bad guy's molecules

881
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,560
over everywhere he was. And the reason he can show such superhuman forbearance is he's

882
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,660
superhuman.

883
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:30,100
Normal jerks couldn't do it. Do you think Clark Kent masturbated? Well, he better not

884
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,860
have. He has superhuman restraint. You've got to pity him. If he did masturbate, of

885
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,940
course, those super-Matozoans would also be super. They could travel at the speed of light,

886
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,500
leaving eerie trails of glowing Cherenkov radiation behind. Pretty soon, they would

887
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,620
find and enter every female womb in Smallville.

888
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:59,180
Now, the normal egg only admits one particular spermatozoan and the rest die. But these things

889
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,020
would just commit super-rape and penetrate every egg that they immediately found. And

890
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,460
of course, fortunately, they couldn't sire a progeny because it's essentially bestiality.

891
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:18,100
If Superman and Lois Lane had sex, that would be an unnatural act, friends. Don't let anyone

892
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,700
tell you different. He looks like a man with a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

893
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:20,700


894
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,780
No, he does not. He looks like us, but that is from convergent evolution.

895
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:33,180
Similar forces cause him to assume the human shape, but he is no humie from Planet Dirtball.

896
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:41,660
He comes from the planet Krypton under a giant red sun. Our yellow sun gives him power, and

897
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,720
he can frisk and frolic in the middle of the yellow sun.

898
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,160
My yellow sun runs away every time it's time to clean its room.

899
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,680
Well, you see, that's what happens when a human sun has a big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

900
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,260
when magnetic attraction and synovial forces are working in the cosmos.

901
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,520
But in addition to the repulsive force, there is the attractive advancing force.

902
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,880
Anyway, Superman is a sad case, really.

903
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,080
He's super, but his terrible penalty is he's alone and there's nobody like him.

904
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,920
And this new movie is quite wrong when it claims that the planet Krypton still exists.

905
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,860
Did you know that?

906
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,080
That in this new stupid Superman movie, the planet Krypton still exists.

907
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,580
He goes off there for a vacation.

908
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,540
Well, that ruins everything.

909
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:35,220
That ruins the sad, byronic predicament of Superman as being one against all.

910
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,740
Because now he has a place to go.

911
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,180
And furthermore, that even demeans his association with the inferior humans.

912
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,840
He's slumming.

913
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,220
He's mocking us, ladies and gentlemen.

914
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,400
He isn't here helping us out.

915
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,840
He's here playing a very...

916
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,720
He's here playing a very cruel joke.

917
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,600
And you can put me down on Lex Luthor's side.

918
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,700
That is, if the planet Krypton still exists.

919
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,600
But it doesn't.

920
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,280
They just have to mess with everything.

921
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,200
Krypton blew up and turned into...

922
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,840
Leave it to Hollywood.

923
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,200
Billions and billions of tons of glowing, greenish rock.

924
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,220
Deadly poisonous to Superman.

925
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,040
Someday Superman will come and destroy Hollywood!

926
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,720
That would be great, wouldn't it?

927
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,660
Yeah, it would.

928
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,840
You know, but for the subgenius, it's a struggle just to pass us by.

929
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,460
Because Clark Kent, in the opposite direction, it takes tremendous concentration.

930
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,400
You have to...

931
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,280
Most of us aren't up for it.

932
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,100
Can't hold down.

933
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,720
One can't mingle with the humans.

934
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,320
We are...

935
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,400
We're not super.

936
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,120
We're sub.

937
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,360
We are fallible beings.

938
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,180
We may be better than the normals, but we are still capable of error.

939
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,600
Of superhuman error, but we are capable of error.

940
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,740
I don't even know how to turn the lights on here.

941
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,320
No, no.

942
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,920
But by subgenius bumbling, you will eventually find out how.

943
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,320
But then...

944
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Bob proved himself on July 5th when Ken Lay died.

945
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,600
That...

946
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,720
I heard that news on the way home on the radio and I was just like, what?

947
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,880
I was...

948
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,160
I was...

949
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,440
That bastard died in his vacation home in Aspen, Colorado.

950
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,640
But he died on July 5th.

951
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,980
Surrounded by luxury.

952
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,100
You know, every imaginable luxury he was surrounded by.

953
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,520
And, you know, that's a much better fate than, you know, what did he die in his sleep to?

954
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,640
I mean, that's a much better fate than the lives of the people he...

955
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,940
Well, he had a heart attack.

956
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,560
I imagine that would wake you up.

957
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,580
Well, you...

958
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,500
I know a lot of people sleep right through heart attacks and never wake up.

959
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,820
And any other day...

960
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,320
Any other day if Ken Lay had died, we would be angry and grumpy.

961
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,660
But he died on July 5th, so that proves that there is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

962
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,100
Well, you know, I hate to...

963
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,460
I will not relax my intellectual standards for...

964
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,140
Even for this program and not even for Bob.

965
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,060
I'm sorry, but that just doesn't flow.

966
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,800
It just doesn't follow logically that it proves there's a Bob.

967
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,760
Well, he got...

968
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,380
I know there's a Bob because I saw him and we burned him alive, remember?

969
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,160
Well, we always burned him alive.

970
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,100
Right, but this...

971
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,900
He keeps coming back for more.

972
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,040
Friends, screw everything because the world has ended and you may have died.

973
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,580
You think about that.

974
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,700
You don't know this might be the escape vessels.

975
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,340
There's so much we don't know.

976
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,980
That's really the whole point of Bob's new improved word.

977
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,920
You just don't know.

978
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,620
You don't know.

979
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:24,060
You don't know if tomorrow some unknown secret relative is going to die and leave you a fortune.

980
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:30,040
Or you don't know if some asteroid is going to crash on the house of an enemy you didn't even know you had.

981
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,960
How will you prove it didn't happen?

982
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,740
So, friends, don't be so sure.

983
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,940
We think we know everything.

984
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,860
We think we know this world is round.

985
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,200
We think we know that we're on planet Earth.

986
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,540
We think we know this is the year 2006.

987
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,280
There's a man who knows.

988
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,600
Welcome to my world.

989
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,880
His t-shirt says.

990
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,940
Oh, it's a cube.

991
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,520
I see.

992
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,040
Like the bizarro world.

993
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,760
That's right.

994
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,480
The bizarro planet looks like that.

995
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:56,960
A cube.

996
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,340
We don't know, friends.

997
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:05,760
In fact, the new Bobliagraphon offers some revelations.

998
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,740
It's not just the same old, same old.

999
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,360
It sure is at first.

1000
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,000
It's Bison, Bob, and Halen.

1001
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,640
Awesome secrets between its pages.

1002
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,600
Mind-shaking, brain-breaking revelations.

1003
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,440
It's a collection of revelations of cosmic awfulness and immensity,

1004
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,580
which will shake you from your head to your heels

1005
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,100
and rivet you to your inner core.

1006
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,660
Just have to read closely.

1007
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,980
I'm tempted to reveal what the final chapter says.

1008
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah, give them a sample.

1009
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:43,460
Just one sample of supernal cosmic trans-hideousness.

1010
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,480
I'll just say this once and then we'll move on.

1011
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,840
This planet is Mars.

1012
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,940
Thank you.

Give me what I need.

1035
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,860
Give me what I want.

1036
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,540
What I can be.

1037
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,020
Come down.

1038
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,840
Bring it down.

1039
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,180
Come down.

1040
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,100
Bring it down.

1041
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,700
Come down.

1042
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,580


1043
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,540
Bring it down.

1044
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,180
Give me what I love.

1045
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,480
Give me what I love.

1046
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,300
Duo!

1047
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,840
Duo!

1048
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,140
Duo!

1049
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,600
Duo!

1050
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:37,820
Duo!

1051
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,280
The conspiracy's in my veins.

1052
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,800
It's eating up my brain.

1053
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,380
I just can't go on like this.

1054
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,580
I can't go on.

1055
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,980
Bring me slack.

1056
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,860
Take it all back.

1057
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,020
Cleanse my soul.

1058
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,660
Make me whole.

1059
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,180
Come down.

1060
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,980
Come down.

1061
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,100
Come down.

1062
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,580
Come down.

1063
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,420
From the sky, come down.

1064
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,360
From the sky, come down.

1065
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,960
I don't need no angel wings.

1066
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,260
I just want the sorceries.

1067
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,100
I don't need no angel wings.

1068
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,280
I just want the sorceries.

1069
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,020
Come down.

1070
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,980
Come down.

1071
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,640
Come down.

1072
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,840
Bring us freedom.

1073
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,640
No war.

1074
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,540
No sin.

1075
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,420
No pain.

1076
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,980
Come down.

1077
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,260
Come down.

1078
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,800
Come down.

1079
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,880
Come down.

1080
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,400
From the heavens.

1081
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,120
At seven.

1082
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,500
Come down.

1083
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,180
Come down.

1084
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,020
From the sky.

1085
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,820
Take us high.

1086
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:07,600
Higher, higher, bring us higher

1087
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:15,220
Higher, higher, and the world's on fire

1088
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,240
We're waiting, you're waiting

1089
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,140
I'm waiting, we're waiting

1090
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,700
It's days and then it's hours

1091
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,400
The suffering soon will end

1092
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:15,960
The pain that they've caused you

1093
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Shall be repaid

1094
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,640
Oh now

1095
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,800
Oh now

1096
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,260
Oh now

1097
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:34,000
From the heavens

1098
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,800
From the heavens

1099
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,320
Take us higher

1100
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,140
Take us higher

1101
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,940
Take me higher

1102
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,620
Take me higher

1103
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,840
Unto the planet burns

1104
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,820
While the peaks stay up

1105
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,400
To ease the pain

1106
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,500
The screams in vain

1107
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,000
Calm down

1108
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,120
Calm down

1109
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,520
Calm down

1110
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,980
Calm down

1111
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,340
Calm down

1112
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,280
Calm down

1113
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,760
Calm down

1114
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,800
Calm down

1115
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,220
Calm down

1116
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,560
Calm down

1117
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
Calm down

1118
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,240
Calm down

1119
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,940
Calm down
