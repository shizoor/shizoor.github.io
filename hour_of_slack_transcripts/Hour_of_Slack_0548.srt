1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Oh, testosterone, oh, testosterone, and we make it all happen with testosterone.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:28,780
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry, our of slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,300
Ahimsa, and ahimsa, dear friends.

4
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:41,700
Okay, I guess the show is now on the road, and friends, I'm going to have to whip through this one so fast,

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,260
I may very well just rant the whole hour, just because it's faster that way,

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,880
and because, well, frankly, we have a lot to say.

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,900
And a long-winded way to say it, too, you better believe it.

8
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,580
Friends, you know, because I've been in an internet rehabilitating frenzy

9
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,980
for the last couple of years, and I've been in a lot of trouble,

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,880
and I guess it shows, because people have been telling me,

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,840
Reverend Stang, relax, man, take it easy.

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,900
Just take your time, dude, frop up, and just flow with each task.

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,080
And, you know, they always say it so sagely,

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,840
like they were talking to a child or a scrambled-brained maniac

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,700
who can't see the forest for the trees or something like that.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,240
Relax, relax, they say, oh, yeah, relax.

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,900
Well, I'll tell you what, my friend.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've been there.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,120
Done that.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,960
In fact, I've spent years slacking off according to normal subgenius standards.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,840
And it makes me sick to think of it.

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,380
I've done that relaxed thing thousands of times, and it was always the same.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,060
The same old thing, and you can have it.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,880
Now, my slack happens to be, you know,

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,180
obviously derived from frenzied, full-on concentrated activity.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,020
I can't stand not to be doing something all the time and doing it fast.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,100
And so, you know, well, things get done half-assedly that way,

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,400
but at least they get done.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,760
You know, I'm the kind of person, if I'm forced to sit and wait,

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,480
I'll just fidget at double speed and read every bottle label inside or something.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,860
I don't know.

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:27,860


34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:27,860


35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,400
Dobbs knows I'm forced to undergo involuntary slack constantly,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,160
having to endure mundane, boring things like eating and bathing

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,560
and communicating with loved ones and, worst of all, sleeping.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,740
I hate those little snatches of death, okay?

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,600
So if I sound like an impatient son of a bitch, it's because I am.

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,980
And I have a damn good reason for it, friends.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm dying.

42
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,120
Yes, I've been told that I have a limited time left.

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,900
Possibly as little as 40 years.

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,300
40 years.

45
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,040
40 years is nothing.

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,340
Nothing. Been there, done that.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Sure, I could spend the rest of that time just sitting on my butt,

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,220
watching TV with drugs in my hand,

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,040
or maybe even reading or jogging around the lake.

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,340
But nay-nay!

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,820
But because I could die any second.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,700
A car wreck or a meteor.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,920
And when my time comes, I ain't going to be saying to myself,

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,000
oh, yeah, darn it, I was going to do that thing, but I put it off.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
Oh, man, did I screw up.

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,300
No, sir, ma'am. No, sir, ma'am.

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,000
Old Reverend Stang will not be laying there hooked up to a machine thinking,

58
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,180
oh, how the hell did I let myself serve the pink?

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm going to be a slave for 75% of my life and sleep the rest of the time.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,780
Don't I get a chance to do it over again?

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,100
And write all those books and make those movies and climb Mount Everest

62
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,360
and be a rock star and make love with all those sex objects?

63
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,740
No?

64
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,640
But that's not fair.

65
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,220
Well, I've got some nasty news for you, my friend.

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,320
You're dying too.

67
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,160
Have been since you were born, Earth boy.

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,880
You ain't got much time left.

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,020
So, you know, sure, while you're young, slack off the easy way.

70
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,500
That's a necessary part of the constant activity of true slack.

71
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,200
But that is merely the launching pad.

72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,800
It's only the beginning.

73
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,240
You know, I'm not saying that.

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,300
Everybody has to be a driven, mean bastard like me,

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,740
having to eat constantly because it's instantly burned off by the fidgeting, if nothing else.

76
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,660
Not everybody had the kind of childhood or nervous system mutations as me.

77
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,100
And many are the subgeniuses whose true calling is probably, in fact,

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,940
to just sit and soak up and voila.

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,600
But!

80
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,140
By the same token,

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,900
STOP TELLING ME TO RELAX!

82
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,260
I was born wired and nothing makes me happier than I was the other day, totally hooked in.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,640
Juggling the interrelationships of hundreds of separate links in my head,

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,360
jumping between WebWeaver, Netscape, and Fetch minute by minute,

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,320
organizing, writing, tweaking, checking, uploading, checking, adding to, uploading, reuploading,

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,300
switching into graphic converter to decrease the load time of a piece of art,

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,720
reuploading, stopping only long enough to flash eat more coffee and pee, which takes too long.

88
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,560
At one with the machines.

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,360
Becoming, becoming the website.

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,600
And ripping myself away only at the very last minute to preach or return the lawyers' calls.

91
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,720
Now, many people live this way at their conspiracy day job at the agency.

92
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,600
And these same people are telling me to relax?

93
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,040
Get thee behind me!

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,700
Get thee behind me!

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


96
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


98
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


99
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


100
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


101
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,700


102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,300
Get thee behind me!

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,300


104
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,300


105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,720
Wait a minute, Bo, y'know, maybe, uh, maybe I'm forgetting something.

106
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,560
Maybe I'm forgetting old Ex-Day!

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,300
In less than 2 years, this'll all be totally moot!

108
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,040
In less than 2 years, I won't have a limited life span, I won't be dyin'.

109
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,760
I dunno, maybe you lazy punks are right after all.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,640
No, no, no, no, no, sir.

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,500
No, sir, because that car wreck or that meteor with my name on it

112
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,120
could be on its way right this second.

113
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,720
So I'll tell you what.

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,780
Let's make a deal, friends.

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,620
After July 5th, 1998, then you know-it-alls can sit on your high horses

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,480
and tell me to relax.

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,160
In the meantime, saying relax, Stan,

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,520
that is like driving a hickory steak into my heart,

119
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,980
chopping off my head and stuffing my mouth with garlic.

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,020
Kriega! Bundalo! Ahemsa!

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,540
Praise damn God Bob and let all that stands in his path be mown down.

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,260
Gotta cut my own head off.

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,140
Cut my own head off.

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,460
Carry it around on the end of a sharp steak.

125
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,440
Gotta cut my own head off.

126
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,140
Cut my own head off.

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
Just don't care what kind of trouble I make.

128
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,640
Gonna cut my own head off.

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,340
Cut my own head off.

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,700
Gonna turn up one morning with no head on my shoulders.

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,820
Gonna cut my own head off.

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,460
Cut my own head off.

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,940
Guess I just don't care who it bothers.

134
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,120
Guess I just don't care who it bothers.

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,340
Who it bothers.

136
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,220
Walked into the barber shop, asked him to lop it off clean.

137
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,020
Told him to get the mirror so I could show him what I mean.

138
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,160
Barber, he freaked out. Said he wouldn't do it.

139
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,420
Gotta cut my own head off. Hand me that machete and I'll prove it.

140
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,160
Gotta cut my own head off.

141
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,040
Cut my own head off.

142
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Have some kid take it into science class.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,380
Science class. Science class.

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Gotta cut my own head off.

145
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,160
Cut my own head off.

146
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Just wanna hear what questions the teacher asks.

147
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,000
Teacher asks.

148
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,500
Gotta cut my own head off.

149
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,260
Cut my own head off.

150
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,060
Hope I don't get in too much trouble.

151
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,160
Too much trouble.

152
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,800
Gotta cut my own head off.

153
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,440
Cut my own head off.

154
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,340
Don't wanna get yelled at for getting blood all over.

155
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,300
Blood all over.

156
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,500
Blood all over.

157
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,960
Blood all over.

158
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Blood all over.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,620
Blood all over.

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,240
Blood all over.

161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,940
Blood all over.

162
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,240
Blood all over.

163
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,040
Blood all over on.

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Blood all over.

165
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,080
Blood all over.

166
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,400
Blood all over on.

167
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:55,160
head off. Put in a box full of crushed ice. Full of crushed ice. Gotta cut my own head off. Cut my own head off.

168
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:03,480
Chill it down so it keeps real nice. Keeps real nice. Gotta cut my own head off. Cut my own head off.

169
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,860
Gonna give it up for scientific research. So they can transplant it on someone else's body

170
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:22,680
and study what it's like to be a jerk. Gonna cut my own head off. Might just slip while I am shaving.

171
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:34,500
Gonna cut my own head off. Just to punish myself for misbehaving. Gonna cut my own head off.

172
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,780
Cut my own head off. And leave it lying there on the floor. On the floor.

173
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,820

175
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,660
Gonna cut my own head off. Cut my own head off.

177
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,840
Uh, yes, dear friends I have tried.

178
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Hims.

179
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,500
Look at that poor old head just rolling there on the floor.

180
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:23,600
That's the head of John Bartles from this special Halloweeny tape he sent us called Halloweeny.

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,580
The evil, evil John Bartles.

182
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,380
Boy, he sent a really sick tape here the other day and we lost it.

183
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,280
I think Jesus lost it.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,960
And oh, Jesus, hell, he ain't even around this weekend.

185
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,200
He's out gallivanting with his girlfriend, DeMonica.

186
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,620
They went to Alamogordo, New Mexico, so they could go visit the Trinity bomb test site

187
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,340
and hopefully pick up some fissionable materials.

188
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,340
We downloaded that famous how to build an atomic bomb with household objects from the Internet.

189
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,380
And so, heck, why not give it a try?

190
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,440
I think everybody should.

191
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,940
In fact, we put that how to build an atom bomb on our website.

192
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,440
Along with the Unabomber manifesto.

193
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,080
And you know, if we put some child pornography on there, it would be the conspiracy's perfect concept of a website.

194
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,580
And friends, we're now going to this show.

195
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:28,100
I think we're going to talk about conspiracies and not just the conspiracy of the normal people,

196
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,560
the conspiracy that you and I have to deal with all the time,

197
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,180
but the other more identifiable conspiracies,

198
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,940
the ones that you and I have to deal with all the time.

199
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,900
Of course, there's a lot of conspiracy nuts out there.

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,160
You know, people that actually think that the government's not your friend.

201
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,840
Well, actually, we'll get into that.

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:01,460
But a dear friend out in the listening audience, let's see, it was Reverend Eric Hamill in Philadelphia.

203
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,580
Praise Philadelphia.

204
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,560
Praise Philadelphia.

205
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:16,640
He sent us this kook flyer, which is rather reminiscent of the famous Francis E. Deck kook flyer.

206
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,560
Very similar.

207
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,200
In fact, this one's printed a little bit better.

208
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,540
Apparently, for the first two paragraphs, this crackpot had access to at least a laser printer.

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,940
Anyway, this flyer, which apparently is being handed out on the streets in the towns of our free nation,

210
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,040
is a very typical representation.

211
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,020
I'm just going to read you some excerpts from this one,

212
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,340
because in some ways it's very typical of a kook, a conspiracy nut.

213
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,940
You know, one of those crazy people.

214
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,980
USA human rights violations continue.

215
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,960
Innocent citizen Norman Rabin, or Rabin, I'll say Rabin,

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,940
is still being illegally held a satellite hostage of multiple satellites monitoring him.

217
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:07,940


218
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:07,940


219
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,740
That's going to be anилоle

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:28,900


222
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,180
But, if this guy got caught something wrong, it was normal to follow.

223
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:36,140
Now, if this guy does that, do you know what these diagnostics for monitors and soldiers is?

224
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,900
Now, further down here it says that Mr. Rabin, who I'm sure typed all this up,

225
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:48,440
Mr. Rabin has been targeted day and night, seven days a week, by tracking, thought monitoring,

226
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,800
including but not limited to monitoring of his thought verbalizations, full body monitoring,

227
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,900
uh-oh, biofrequency voice assault, debilitation, biofrequency assaults at his body,

228
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,160
such as torments, tortures, and harassments, since February, May 1992,

229
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,460
and mind control, i.e. thought-inhibiting assault, and during sleep, artificial dreams,

230
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,820
having visual contents and sound contents, including voice contents, since late December 1990.

231
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,120
From January 5-6, February 2, 1986, CIA satellite operations covertly assaulted Mr. Rabin

232
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,640
with a, quote, satellite-caused mania, unquote,

233
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,980
until Mr. Rabin was hospitalized for the first time in his life,

234
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,720
at 1 a.m. February 2, 1986, diagnosis, mania.

235
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:47,160
During January-February 21, 1986, the USA offered to the USSR to make Norman Rabin a, quote,

236
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,840
designated prisoner, unquote, or similar, in exchange for the early release of then-imprisoned

237
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,060
prominent Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly B. Sharansky, a mathematician by training.

238
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,540
Aha!

239
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,140
Satellites assaulted Mr. Rabin during two attempted withdrawals from Massacre,

240
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,760
and the U.S. intelligence, in late December 1989, and February 1990,

241
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,460
Mr. Rabin successfully withdrew from psychiatric medications.

242
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,860
However, U.S. intelligence targeted Mr. Rabin with various tracking and assault.

243
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,520
During 5-28-90, a Baghdad summit of grave threat to their, oh, some, but not all, Arab leaders

244
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,640
condemned Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel as a grave threat to their security.

245
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,960
In July 1990, U.S. intelligence,

246
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:43,640
informed Iraq that Norman Rabin was their symbol of Soviet Jewry and their symbol of human rights abuse,

247
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,220
and that Norman would be flying to Israel August 1 to 1990.

248
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,260
Iraq invaded Kuwait on the U.S. given date of August 2, 1990.

249
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,380
Up to August 15, 1990, Mr. Rabin did not realize that U.S. intelligence had targeted his life.

250
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,720
However, that morning, biofrequency voice transmissions,

251
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,420
clearly understandable as such, were transmitted to Mr. Rabin's unequipmented head.

252
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:20,280
By October 17, 1990, Mr. Rabin understood that he was a victim of U.S. intelligence since 1986,

253
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,920
a result of his having read the founding Ph.D. dissertation of OCG technology.

254
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,700
When this crime began, Norman Rabin was 25 years old and less than two years,

255
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:45,720
35 years old now, and died more than a year younger than his 80-year-old working years of employment due to the Field 건데 rating.

261
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,360
graduate education starting during his 20s, and to have lived in liberty during all these years.

262
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:09,660
In summary, this is a maliciously evil human rights violation. Again, our U.S. government

263
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,860
is maliciously holding a total of 30 or 40 or probably more acknowledged as innocent citizens

264
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:24,840
as satellite prisoners. Please help petition our government to stop this crime. Well, I don't know

265
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:36,220
that we can help Mr. Rabin because Mr. Rabin sounds like he's crazy. I mean, satellite monitoring of

266
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,720
your thoughts and satellites, making him act like a crazy person to be locked up? I mean, that's just

267
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,320
crazy!

268
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:54,540
Isn't it? And in his case, it probably is. But you know, friends, worse things actually do happen.

269
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:05,320
Worse things really do happen all the time. And we tend to forget, I mean, we subgeniuses like to

270
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:13,740
research into conspiracies, cover-ups, and crimes because sometimes that path leads you to something

271
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,840
hilarious and scary.

272
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:26,180
And sometimes it leads you back into stuff that most of the time you'd rather forget. And I've been reading a book lately called

273
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:36,220
Conspiracies, Cover-Ups, and Crimes, published by our friends at Illuminet Press. This is a book by Jonathan Vanken,

274
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,740
who has a couple of other good conspiracy books out. He said some naughty things about the Church of the Subgenius,

275
00:19:44,840 --> 00:20:14,820
at one time. But we forgive him because we like his attitude in these books. Because it's an attitude of healthy skepticism battered to shreds by the true and simple facts that a fascist shadow government really does, if not control the world, at least is pulling enough strings in the United States that it's ripping the bowels off of the people.

276
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:25,460
BecauseCompletely, we do have to remove the bowels of our nation. What this is conscious, Straظny Recently, I've written a book a bit two so this how talks, 1962

280
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:32,920


281
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:32,920


282
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,220
Today

283
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm to

284
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:44,480
know, the conspiracy of the old rich fat white boys. And we do tend to forget. Now, I'm going

285
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,840
to read from this book, Conspiracies, Cover-Ups, and Crimes. I'm doing excerpts just as I excerpted

286
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:57,440
from Mr. Rabin. I'm leaving out a lot of the facts and I'm just going for the rant. Because

287
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,220
either you already know what I'm talking about and just need a little pep talk every now

288
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,660
and then, which I certainly did, that's the way this book functioned for me. Or you're

289
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,980
going to think this is all silly and crazy and Mr. Clinton or Mr. Dole or Mr. Perot or

290
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:24,380
Mr. Somebody or Ms. Big Sister or somebody's going to save you. The very plausibility of

291
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,220
assassination conspiracies is what makes them so hard to swallow. The more real our fears,

292
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,240
the greater our psychological defenses.

293
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:40,680
Assassination theories are terrifying because they could be true. As difficult as it would

294
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,860
be to maintain a massive conspiracy to rule the world, a limited conspiracy against one

295
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,640
person is easy to assemble. Yet, eliminating one person can be a most powerful means of

296
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,420
controlling a whole society of people. If President John F. Kennedy was killed by a

297
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,220
conspiracy, that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a permanent global conspiracy.

298
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,980
But, killing Kennedy was a good step toward ruling America, which rules a large part of

299
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:16,280
the world. Even a larger conspiracy involving criminals and intelligence agents doesn't

300
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,940
mean that there is an all-consuming Illuminati conspiracy. It doesn't mean there isn't one

301
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,820
either. Researchers such as May Brussel and Dave Emery placed the CIA mafia brotherhood

302
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,220
into a sprawling network of Nazis and fascists who gained their grip on the American people.

303
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,220


304
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,860
They were the ones who set up the US government after World War II, when the US collaborated

305
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,360
with thousands of Nazis to set up the then-burgeoning Cold War national security establishment.

306
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:50,680
And that's the problem with admitting even the tiniest conspiracy. Once you step into

307
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,300
the forest, there's no telling where the trails will lead.

308
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,200
The lone nut doctrine is dogma, and assassination conspiracy theories heresy because they're

309
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,200


310
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,780
homicidal kooks have no political motives. When film director Oliver Stone, armed with

311
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:16,560
much research, proposed in his 1991 JFK that the escalation of the Vietnam War and the

312
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,060
assassination of President Kennedy may have been more than coincidental, reaction in the

313
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,240
national media was ridicule.

314
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,760
The truth is more troubling for Americans in the long run.

315
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,200
The truth being that violence is a crime. The truth is that violence is a crime. The

316
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,080
violent issues of the world they receive and associate with violence without wanting to

317
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,380
talk about can change the American system.

318
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,480
Which is coming on 꼭 Important Khalid

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:49,960

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:49,960


321
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,640
Since you have authenticated your own people falsely, wax.

Ahem.

Oh, by the way, friends, this music in the background is by Cosmic Vortex,

325
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,120
a local band with my buddy El Diablo on guitar.

326
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,620
Yes, Jesus is our business manager, and El Diablo is our guitar player.

327
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,880
Well, I'll be damned if we weren't anywhere near the end of that tape.

328
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,560
I love those little dark windows.

329
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,120
But you know, if the JFK assassination, dear friends,

330
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,580
was the work of lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald

331
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,160
acting out of some personal scent of disgruntlement and alienation,

332
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,800
then the whole Vietnam War,

333
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
was an accident.

334
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,440
But what if the assassination was carried out by a conspiracy?

335
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,840
Could escalating the war for reasons of ideology and corporate profiteering

336
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,980
have been one of the conspirators' motivations?

337
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,480
Then wouldn't the Vietnam War be an event planned by individuals

338
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,920
outside the American system of electoral politics, of checks and balance?

339
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,820
The American system, it would appear,

340
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,860
could have been altered by that crossfire in Dallas,

341
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,140
and more importantly, by the people.

342
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,240
And the people who planned it.

343
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,480
Uh, yes, friends.

344
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,740
And the people who planned it are still running this city today.

345
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,100
Well, they're pretty old, and they're sitting back,

346
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,760
and they're not listening to this radio show,

347
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,040
and they don't really have to listen to much of anything,

348
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,560
because they're really rich.

349
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,880
And they've got friends in high places.

350
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,780
But friends, we've got Bob, and that's why we aren't dead yet.

351
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,580
Uh, Bob wants to see us tortured like David Koresh.

352
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,040
It would be beautiful.

353
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,180
And one day, we'll be dead.

354
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,400
Wonderful.

355
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,140
And we will go gladly to our graves as martyrs for that man Bob.

356
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,220
Yes?

357
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,500
Yeah, right, sure.

358
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,960
.

359
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:11,960


360
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,980
.

361
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,480
.

362
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


363
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


364
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


365
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


366
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


367
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


368
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,480


369
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,500
.

370
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,780
.

371
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,400
.

372
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


373
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


374
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,400


375
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,760
Thank you.

376
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,280
And that's the primary purpose for this show,

377
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,360
spending your money.

378
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,520
We make sure you see what you do,

379
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,860
is you will be contacting our thin world agents,

380
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,540
and I'm pretty sure you have one in your neighborhood,

381
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,580
and they will then give you a special arrangement.

382
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,480
They will arrange a special arrangement,

383
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,900
Here we're seeing the...

384
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,220
If you look on the visitron, you can see the two-week visit beginning for a lucky family.

385
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,400
Hey, look out!

386
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,020
Here you see a two-week visit represented in streamers of blue and red.

387
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,040
The red represents the second week after Critical Capital has built up.

388
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,960
Well, in my visit through ThemeWorld, I found myself weighed down with the accoutrements of the TourEye.

389
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,960
You weren't given a ThemeWorld special complimentary card?

390
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,020
I went into ThemeWorld without my own theme, and so you can become lost if you depend on an alien theme.

391
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,320
Indeed, this is one problem, because folks might lose their themes at ThemeWorld.

392
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
Some might gain them, some might lose them.

393
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,320
You have to go to the Themology Lost and Found Park to find your own theme again.

394
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,600
And it would take a trained themologist to tell the difference.

395
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,140
And remember, of course, that there are counterfeit themes going around the park.

396
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,960
They're so long-distance.

397
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,420
That's right.

398
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,260
It resembled a human being.

399
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,640
It did at that time, but only to the witnesses who saw the swamp gas coalesce around the police car.

400
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,420
And shut off its radio.

401
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,720
These themes have to be read at the head of the class every 20 minutes to the accompaniment of theme music.

402
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,160
Now what is the most potent invocation you can have against the conspiracy?

403
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,920
Dot, dot, dot, or kill me!

404
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,820
Say it!

405
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,800
Kill me now!

406
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,040
There is the honorary ThemeWorld guide known as Suspect Duck.

407
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,000
Is there any way to recognize Suspect Duck?

408
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,920
Suspect Duck.

409
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:12,920


410
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,180
Suspect Duck.

411
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,760
Suspect Duck.

412
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:13,940
Suspect Duck.

413
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,940


414
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,940


415
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,940


416
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,940


417
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:13,940


418
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,320
Social media has a large bill.

419
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,680
So does puzzling evidence though.

420
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,600
Well, Suspect Duck is covered with feathers.

421
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,280
Evolution has given Suspect Duck the amazing quality of mimic, mimic, mimic, mimic, mimic, mimic, mimic.

422
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,260
Well, Mike, what other pavilliums are available to the general viewing public at this time in Time World?

423
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,140
Well, basically you have to make sure that you're properly dressed.

424
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,660
What we do is we try to make sure that you're fitted out for the acid rainforest.

425
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,580
At the rainforest.

426
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,660
Besides manual camera.

427
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,600
And the lake of dreams.

428
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,500
And so what we do is we have our special theme stylist who comes around and checks out your

429
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,040
particular mood theme and then tailors a whatever you need.

430
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,420
Oh, here, oh, it feels good.

431
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,880
Oh.

432
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,000
And even the Church of the Subgenius itself is represented in the theme world.

433
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,140
Yeah, I hear it.

434
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
The Tower of Bob.

435
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,260
The Tower of Bob.

436
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,220
I saw early pictures.

437
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,820
The Tower of Bob contains the world's largest slack generator.

438
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,900
Right in your own home.

439
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,400
Wow.

440
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:21,060
And actually reaching the Tower of Bob is also the key goal of the ZX game.

441
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Reaching the Tower of Bob and falling in.

442
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,720
I see.

443
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,060
One reaches the Tower of Bob, does one attain Bobism?

444
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,000
No, one becomes a pillar of salt.

445
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,580
Well, it's...

446
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,800
Let's say if some fellow, like maybe it could be me, just says,

447
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,840
I just wanted to, you know, get off and get off by himself and, well, maybe take a friend

448
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,940
or take the wife and kids and have some fun and head out to theme world, just how would

449
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,000
he start to be about to get to go about it?

450
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,200
Well, you just get off at the theme world exit.

451
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,140
The theme, can you take it?

452
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,380
Next six exits.

453
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,140
Yes, theme the 13th.

454
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,380
I saw that theme, it's just a dried, withered up old piece of junk.

455
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,000
I can't remember if it's called Pop One.

456
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,540
I'm just going to start over.

457
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:24,380
There's a whole generation of college students now who were born after the 1960s were over.

458
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,560
Born in a world in which The Beatles had already broken up,

459
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,960
a world in which Richard Nixon had already been president and rather than carrying out

460
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,820
his promise to end the Vietnam War was dropping bombs on Cambodia instead.

461
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:46,130
instead. The Love Inn at Woodstock had already happened. Peace marches and civil disobedience

462
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:54,590
had been replaced by orgies of hatred and burning cities. Something new and malignant had surfaced

463
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:01,390
in America. It first appeared when Kennedy's head was blown open as he rode in an uncovered limousine

464
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:08,410
through a grimy section of Dallas on a route, incidentally, that he had never planned to take.

465
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:17,410
It was a different world the days before Dallas. It was a world in which people still had savings,

466
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:23,750
and you got by with a family of four on one income. There was a sense of America's place

467
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:32,650
in the world. Now things have become vicious and ugly and nasty. Doesn't it feel like there's a

468
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:38,330
direct path from Dallas to the brutal state of society today?

469
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:46,130
The path leads through the assassination, from the assassination through Vietnam,

470
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,670
the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which led to several years of rioting,

471
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:57,570
and the slaying of Robert Kennedy, without whom Richard Nixon almost certainly never would have

472
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:04,350
been president. The calamities continue through Watergate, another national trauma. The same year,

473
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,830
conservative Democratic presidential contender George Wallace was shot and

474
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,950
paralyzed. Together, with the Watergate Dirty Tricks campaign, the Wallace shooting ensured that

475
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:22,370
Nixon would be president for a second term. Watergate was followed by all sorts of sordid revelations

476
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:29,270
about the CIA, including its plethora of attempts and cahoots with the mafia to knock off Fidel

477
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:35,530
Castro. There was conflict in the Middle East, which led to a false gas shortage. Oil companies

478
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,950
were able to jack up prices several hundred percent throughout the f molted term. The deaths and

479
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,950


480
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,950


481
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,950


482
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,950


483
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,070
They enriched themselves, consolidated power, and unleashed oppressive inflation.

484
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,790
There are links between oil companies and the CIA.

485
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,710
As early as the 1950s, the National Security Council had authored a secret directive

486
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:00,050
designating multinational oil companies as instruments of U.S. foreign policy.

487
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,010
Big oil companies were put beyond the reach of U.S. law.

488
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:14,310
The overthrow of American-backed Shah, a pavlovi of Iran, by a radical Islamic uprising came next.

489
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,730
The Iranian revolutionaries seized an embassy full of American hostages

490
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,910
and destroyed the administration of President Jimmy Carter.

491
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,370
Carter's Desert One attempted rescue mission only made matters worse.

492
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,550
The rescue copters crashed in the Iranian desert.

493
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,790
One of the players in the Desert One scenario was General Richard Secord.

494
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:41,970
Who would become a public figure a few years later as one of the Iran-Contra conspirators.

495
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:49,450
Mixed into this parade of perdition were assorted terrorist killings, hijackings, and kidnappings in the U.S. and abroad,

496
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:56,470
which reinforced American feelings of national irrelevance, individual impotence, and governmental iniquity.

497
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,170
It is a logical fallacy to assume that outcome and motive are necessarily the same.

498
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,010
Nonetheless,

499
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,290
after the Kennedy killing, the United States petrified into a permanent war economy.

500
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,410
The Vietnam War segued quickly into the renewed Cold War.

501
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,410
Even when our Eastern Bloc enemies loosened up,

502
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,990
President Bush warned that there would be no peace dividend from reduced military spending.

503
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,550
Of every American federal tax dollar, more than 25 cents goes to the defense budget.

504
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,870
Huge defense contracting companies siphon trillions from the economy.

505
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,990
The money goes to no productive use.

506
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:34,990


507
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:40,430
Crippling the capacity for individual enterprise and with it, the American spirit.

508
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,430
Draw your own conclusions.

509
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:49,870
The harvest of these sad seeds was the cynical and shallow Reagan 80s.

510
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:58,850
Political involvement dropped to record lows while power grew ever more centralized in a shrinking number of gigantic corporations.

511
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,870
Freed from public oversight, the corporations acted almost as nations unto themselves.

512
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,910
The weak ones died while the strong merged.

513
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:15,490
The corporate takeover of America concentrated economic power in the hands of a few,

514
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,130
but showed its most anti-democratic effects in the media business.

515
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,130
Not only money, but information.

516
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:29,630
The air, water, and food of democracy came under the control of elite interests.

517
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,850
Is America in the pocket of its own people?

518
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,030
Is America in the pocket of its own killer cabal?

519
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:42,450
One much cleaner and quieter than the gangs who rule the banana republics we hold in contempt?

520
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:50,310
Are we a nation in the grip of kinder, gentler death squads?

521
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,230
Yes, friends, the Church of the Subgenius is a weird cult.

522
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,950
A secret society.

523
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,230
Scary, huh?

524
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,830
Well, in the church of the subgenius, there's a cult called the Church of the Subgenius.

525
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:10,930
In the 20th century, an equally strange cult, the intelligence community of the United States government,

526
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,010
has also experimented with remolding the human mind.

527
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,850
The umbrella for these efforts was a program called MK Ultra,

528
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:26,830
approved back in 1953 by CIA director Alan Dulles at the urging of Richard Helms,

529
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,970
who would later become director of the Central Intelligence Agency himself.

530
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,450
As did George Bush, of course.

531
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,510
MK Ultra gained its notoriety for introducing LSD into America,

532
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,850
giving birth to the 1960s counterculture.

533
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,970
Its darker purpose was to create the perfect agent, the Manchurian Candidate,

534
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,390
an agent who would take any order without question,

535
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,370
who would be absolutely trustworthy, an agent with no free will.

536
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,630
And the book goes on to talk about people who could very...

537
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,810
who behaved in and had connections in the past

538
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,830
that led one to think that some of them were just a bunch of idiots.

539
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,630
And some of such things actually happened.

540
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,510
One is Sirhan Sirhan,

541
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,390
who would do this automatic writing under hypnosis,

542
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,430
scribbling mind control, mind control over and over again.

543
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,370
He's the guy who shot Robert Kennedy, by the way.

544
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,250
Or they say.

545
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,810
Actually, there was another guy with a gun standing right behind him,

546
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,090
but he worked for the government, so they didn't...

547
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,310
Jody, the Jody Foster-obsessed John Hinckley Jr.

548
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,810
appears to be another subject for research.

549
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,410
He was a great brainwasher.

550
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,310
Of course, his dad was a good friend of George Bush.

551
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,270
And yet another one is Mark David Chapman,

552
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,750
who killed John Lennon for no real discernible sane reason,

553
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,650
but who had actually worked with CIA training groups

554
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,390
that were connected to Christian training groups.

555
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:03,250
And then there's the long list of dead people connected with the Iran-Contra affair.

556
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,890
I have had knowledge of an October surprise deal

557
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:14,570
between 1980 Reagan for President campaign and the Islamic Iranian government.

558
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,410
The deal is said to have delayed the release of American hostages

559
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,450
until after Reagan's inauguration,

560
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,850
in exchange for arms shipments and other covert operations.

561
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,450
And then, friends, you get further into it and further into it,

562
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,290
and you find out that,

563
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,210
ugh,

564
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,450
do you know the CIA

565
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,530
and all their buddies have been involved in serious drug smuggling for a long time?

566
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,210
And in fact,

567
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,470
and this is the kind of thing that most of us knew

568
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,150
about 15 years ago, 10 years ago at least,

569
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,270
and it's now coming out in the news that,

570
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:55,530
yes, indeed, there really was a lot of drug smuggling

571
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,530
that was empowered by the CIA.

572
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,170
Crack and cocaine are distributed in LA,

573
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,350
with impunity,

574
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,050
with the cooperation of corrupt cops,

575
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,370
also associated with the CIA,

576
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,530
and in New York.

577
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,090
This ain't crackpot stuff.

578
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,450
This is all in the books.

579
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,970
They were doing it so they'd have money

580
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:24,130
to fund the Contras and fight the secret war

581
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,210
in South Central America.

582
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,190
And friends,

583
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,390
the CIA's only own thinly disguised cover airlines,

584
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,730
and the only one that's ever been designed since the war in Vietnam,

585
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,770
Air America flew opium in and out of Laos

586
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,730
as a way of financing the illegal Laotian War

587
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,030
without going to Congress.

588
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,410
Much of the heroin manufactured from the CIA-couriered base

589
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,250
was being sold to American servicemen in Southeast Asia

590
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,310
who developed a widespread heroin problem.

591
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,150
Now,

592
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,550
then you get into Noriega, friends.

593
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,950
Remember when we bust,

594
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,730
we went in there,

595
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,370
went in there and kicked ass in Panama.

596
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,730
To comprehend the government's role in cocaine traffic,

597
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,990
Noriega is useful as a kind of focal point.

598
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,490
He was on the C-I-

599
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,070
uh, the payroll of the CIA.

600
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,470
At the same time,

601
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,590
he worked for the Medellin Cartel

602
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,030
for four million dollars a month.

603
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,810
The Medellin Cartel for you kids

604
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,230
is the Colombian cocaine syndicate

605
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,630
responsible for most of the cocaine

606
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,810
that enters the USA.

607
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,770
Noriega was also connected to George Bush,

608
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,050
and through Bush to Oliver North,

609
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,650
they used Noriega as a conduit

610
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,230
for getting arms to the Contras.

611
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,070
Bush, North,

612
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,170
the other government insiders at the CIA,

613
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,770
and the National Security Council,

614
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,270
which under Reagan got heavily into covert operations,

615
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,610
knew about Noriega's involvement with drugs,

616
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,850
but, uh,

617
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,550
you know,

618
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,290
when it looked like the guy was about to start flapping his lips

619
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,390
and push it too far,

620
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,650
they had to take him out.

621
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,230
Um,

622
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,970
accounts of testimony before Senator Kerry's committee

623
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,450
revealed that Felix Rodriguez,

624
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,070
CIA agent and friend of George Bush,

625
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,630
arranged a ten million dollar donation

626
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,570
to the Contras direct from the Medellin Cartel.

627
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,230
The cartel's chief accountant and money launderer

628
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,390
testified to the donation.

629
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,590
The same guy was said to have conveyed

630
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,470
180,000 dollars in campaign contributions

631
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,230
from the Medellin Cartel

632
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,210
to Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign,

633
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,370
and was invited to Reagan's inauguration

634
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,670
as a gesture of thanks from the grateful candidate.

635
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,470
The guns for drugs deals,

636
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,050
many of which centered on,

637
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,190
uh,

638
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,010
blah blah blah blah blah,

639
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,890
man, friend,

640
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,610
well, here's the thing,

641
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,850
this could go on and on and on and on and on,

642
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,470
and it does,

643
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,650
and, um,

644
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,690
if, if your access to news is based on

645
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,610
the, uh,

646
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,810
liberal biased media like,

647
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,070
uh,

648
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,710
Time Magazine and,

649
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,570
uh,

650
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,210
Newsweek,

651
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,210


652
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,890
and, and PBS,

653
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,110
and NBC,

654
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,210
and, uh,

655
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,570
other, uh, government and corporate-owned,

656
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,350
uh, news,

657
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,610
uh, organizations,

658
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,490
and, uh,

659
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,730
I'm sure this stuff all sounds like the same

660
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,290
old crazed pinko liberal garbage,

661
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,710
uh, that,

662
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,750
you know, I mean,

663
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,470
it's just laughable, isn't it?

664
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,650
And yet,

665
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,110
and yet,

666
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,130
and yet,

667
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,190
there it is, friends,

668
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,190
every bit of the stuff that I just said,

669
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,550
is not only true,

670
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,430
but you can go look it up.

671
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,030
The fact that they don't spell it out

672
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,650
on the front page of the newspaper

673
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,750
should tell you something right there.

674
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,510
Because I'm telling you,

675
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,790
I'm telling you now,

676
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,490
that,

677
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,570
you know,

678
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,910
I've been looking out upon this radio audience,

679
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:43,670
and,

680
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,650
lest ye repent,

681
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,010
ye are lower than the lowest primate!

682
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,110
You were a subgenius,

683
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,790
but that's way too small time for us,

684
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,190
those bikers!

685
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,170
Dobbs has stuff stashed away,

686
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,030
four miles under the Alps,

687
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,070
and yet you call me Snooty?

688
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:00,910
Snooty?

689
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,490
But see,

690
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,730
but see, that's just it.

691
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,510
This is how.

692
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,110
You're in the filth of the woodwork.

693
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,030
This is the fate of the conspiracy,

694
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,790
an eerie valley to the Connie Tights.

695
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,750
But it is Bob,

696
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,010
Bob's grace alone that the South Passage

697
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,870
leading to the Hollow Earth in this infinitely stupid radio show

698
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,850
of non-tobacco ingredients even exists!

699
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:24,630
Bob!

700
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,450
I mean,

701
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,210
run a search,

702
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,630
run a search program on Bob's name on this newsgroup,

703
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,790
and I'll bet it'll show up Republican conservatives

704
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,450
and put them in camps!

705
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,610
We'll show them!

706
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,330
Invent designer viruses that let live only those humans

707
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,010
with that low-level,

708
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,990
ego-bound snittiness.

709
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,950
Invent designer viruses that someone has killed and replaced

710
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,950
with liberal,

711
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,630
one-worlder look-alikes.

712
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,630
The foot-tall robot legume

713
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,510
with the dark,

714
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:58,030
blue nerve gas canisters with blood!

715
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,950
We've been briefed on the file.

716
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,550
Keepest thine membership card close to thine breast,

717
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,770
lest thou enjoin that Bob is the dark blue nerve gas canisters.

718
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,570
Then he sends six church air tanks

719
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,070
and eight damn froth fertilizer tubes to Michigan.

720
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,510
Then what they paid for was gonna be struck down all.

721
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,950
Your hard drives rent asunder,

722
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,930
signing butts,

723
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,730
or else hear about doing a special on the church?

724
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,310
Well, they did it.

725
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,350
And mark my words,

726
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,230
the Yuccatism shall feast on the remnants.

727
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,970
For lo, my people are blinded, my friends,

728
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,870
but the vengeance of Dobbs shall be visited upon ye

729
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,970
mighty handfuls of flatulent jockstraps.

730
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,230
You're a maniacal heap of foul male clippage.

731
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,930
You're a drive-by in the radiance of musty elephant phlegm.

732
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,170
You are lower than the conservatives

733
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,130
which make for lack of ill-conceived iguana droppings.

734
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,270
You can't see the prison for the naked glory of Bob.

735
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,710
Totally accessible and naked, my children.

736
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,530
Bob shall feast on everything we make.

737
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,990
The real ex-day, Bob's wrath in the city.

738
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,390
This wallowing in the office.

739
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,130
He just paid actors decoys

740
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,640
to make us think that the liberals or socialists

741
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,880
had been killed by dinosaurs.

742
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,760
Sure, but come ex-day, the pamphlet,

743
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,800
my address on everything we know,

744
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,680
it might show up once or twice in city after city.

745
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,620
I guess you all got so marked

746
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,820
for the further glory

747
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,360
of Bob.

748
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,400
Bob! Remember him?

749
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,460
Bob!

750
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,040
Bob!

751
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,160
Chip Machrack.

752
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


753
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


754
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


755
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


756
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


757
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


758
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,160


759
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,400
fellow of yours.

760
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,120
Hehehehe.

761
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,300
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

762
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,780
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

763
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,000
Uh, it's, uh, what, sixty dollars?

764
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,220
One for you, Smith, one for you, Jones.

765
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,900
And, uh, don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

766
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,540
Hehehehe.

767
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,300
One, two, three, and four.

768
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,920
I want to suck blood.

769
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,300
Don't you think that might be fun?

770
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,420
Just hanging around with my teeth in your neck.

771
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,980
And afterwards we could have a cigarette.

772
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,500
I got to find an aphrodisiac.

773
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,020
For my favorite hemophiliac.

774
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,940
I just want to suck blood.

775
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,040
Cause that's the thing that I love.

776
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,800
I just want to sink my teeth into your neck.

777
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,620
I'm not looking for commitment or gratuitous sex.

778
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,140
Just let me have some fun.

779
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,000
Please let me have some fun.

780
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,500
Please let me suck your blood.

781
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,140
I'm no pervert.

782
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,740
I'm no weirdo.

783
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,440
I'm no Nazi and no fascist.

784
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,100
I just happen to be a recreational phlebotomist.

785
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,720
So let's have some fun.

786
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,280
And let me suck your blood.

787
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,860
Just hanging around with my teeth in your neck.

788
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,000
Don't you think it might be fun?

789
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,220
Uh-huh.

790
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,400
Is it getting clearer now?

791
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,420
It is getting clearer.

792
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,080
Drive yourself to the hospital.

793
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,160
I'm in the driver's seat.

794
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,020
There's a bottom of Fred Astaire.

795
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,460
The driver's seat at the bottom of Fred Astaire.

796
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,400
How much did you take?

797
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,580
Forty thousand, I think.

798
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,360
How many thousand copies has the book sold?

799
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,040
Thousands and thousands of oodles of them.

800
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,340
In fact, you can hear some of the copies we're dropping on Central America right now.

801
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,180
Get out of the way!

802
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,800
During the evening hours, savor the great dining and exciting nightlife of San Salvador.

803
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,060
Dine in plush restaurants where the gracious service makes for an unfathomable experience.

804
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,120
Smell that!

805
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,000
We've sold thousands, but guess how many?

806
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,700
Don't be sentimental with me.

807
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,260
Let's look at it logically.

808
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,860
I guess about 70,000.

809
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,480
Okay, and guess how many we've shredded?

810
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,180
Uh...

811
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,360
Okay, 150.

812
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
Okay, well that was our confession.

813
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,960
We have shredded 150,000 copies of the book just because they accidentally contained a real kernel of information,

814
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,480
which we deemed you the outsider force.

815
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,060
Okay.

816
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,280
That's right.

817
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:10,580
That's right.

818
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,000
I forgot about that.

819
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,480
You're too dull and unknowledgeable to contain inside your feeble little brains.

820
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,660
Whereas we over people...

821
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,320
They're out there, though.

822
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,480
For a while, those were being sold for two extra dollars.

823
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,020
That's right.

824
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,080
You can actually...

825
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,980
Now, you can find them in Moe's or Shakespeare's for actually 45 cents or so.

826
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,180
And the kernel of truth is underlined in some of them.

827
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:26,860
That's right.

828
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,520
Here we see miniature creatures attempting a subtenuous beach party of their own.

829
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:32,860
Unfortunately...

830
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,980
Look at that.

831
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,360
They're being engulfed by large lobsters and decapods.

832
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,880
Well, it's hard for anyone.

833
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,600
Boy, look at that.

834
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,440
What a struggle.

835
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,700
And here we are.

836
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,400
Looks like a friendly fellow.

837
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,060
But don't be mistaken.

838
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,360
Those double-edged rows of serrated teeth surrounded by rasping tentacles each when it's

839
00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:01,060
tragellant inflict a painful nip, as is demonstrated by our willing studio invaders.

840
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,940
Well, that was information.

841
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,720
I was wondering if you had God's phone number.

842
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,280
Ha, got you there, huh?

843
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,520
Okay.

844
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,380
You've been listening to this stupid thing for two hours.

845
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,460
He doesn't like his little collar haircut.

846
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,160
Well, sorry.

847
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,060
Hello, next problem.

848
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,080
No, if you can, put your hair between your legs and kiss Connie's panties goodbye.

849
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,520
Well, we should...

850
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,060
Oh, those guys again.

851
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,780
Yeah, those guys.

852
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,500
Well, it's getting late and the stupid people come out of their rocks at night and...

853
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah.

854
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,800
Large blobs can come at any time to engulf you and make mishmash hash out of all your

855
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,540
dreams and aspirations.

856
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,500
The tiniest radio station.

857
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,700
Broadcasting across the globe.

858
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


859
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


860
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


861
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


862
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


863
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:36,700


864
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,680
Lost in nation by mail.

865
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,160
Yes.

866
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,300
Can I help you?

867
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,440
Of course, it's a matter of time.

868
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,160
Yeah, we called your show.

869
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,100
Yeah, say something funny, quick.

870
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,420
I thought you were holding a survey.

871
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,420
Same thing.

872
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,840
Is this one of these junk calls?

873
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,760
Yeah, we're the junk, you're the call.

874
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,440
Yes, yes.

875
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,660
Well, I'd rather go to the planet of the apes.

876
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,440
What I'd like to know is why the book of the subgenius doesn't have a cross-indexed index,

877
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,740
a massive reference index.

878
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,240
It does, but that's not something we could show to the public.

879
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,400
It's a lot like the real soundtrack to the Creeping Terror.

880
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,160
It just isn't right.

881
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:01,720
Hey!

882
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,620
I left a good job in the movies.

883
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,020
Yeah, something's not right here.

884
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,000
This is puzzling evidence.

885
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,260
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

886
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,520
We're going to rearrange everything.

887
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,720
I'm down here at the studio.

888
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,060
I'm just going to mix in a little bit differently here because we've got a real problem with

889
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,140
the theme, don't you think?

890
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,020
First we're talking about Philo and then we're in this restaurant in El Salvador and it just

891
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,420
isn't right.

892
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,420
Here, I tell you what, let's really have a theme here, okay?

893
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,200
Okay.

894
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,860
I know this morning we have some friends aboard.

895
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,840
Yes, this morning we have some fellow travelers.

896
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,300
We have Mr. Mike Believe and Mr. Gene Poole.

897
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,980
Oh, yeah.

898
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,980
From the theme world.

899
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,360
Yes, the theme for the sub-theme.

900
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,760
Tonight is theme world.

901
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,620
Theme world.

902
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,460
Think about it.

903
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,700
Oh, don't get dizzy now, Colin.

904
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,620
Well, just wait and see what happens as these two happy-go-lucky themists discuss themology

905
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,440
and themism.

906
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:57,720
The Lord High Themocrat, Mr. Mike Believe, might wish to try to expiate his sins by describing

907
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,560
some of the remarkable extrusions and profusions of theme world, which might even include the

908
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,780
grand mystery known as the theme-er for the theme theme.

909
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,900
When he leaves the theme-er-ium, he might caution himself to remember the words of

910
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,280
that great themistically who said that the city would be saved by wooden walls, but these

911
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,740
are walls surely more durable if less expendable.

912
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,760
What are some of the attractions at theme world, Mr. Believe?

913
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, it doesn't even have to be there.

914
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,460
I'm getting a goddamn sick and tired of computers calling me up and talking to me inanely.

915
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:31,700
Yeah.

916
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,600
I love the time we just have.

917
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:44,600
We use what we call totally modular, which includes very, very simple images that...

918
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,600
Oh, they feel so nice.

919
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,980
Well, they're sort of tactile, I gather, eh, Fuzzy?

920
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,000
You can stroke them?

921
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,060
Yeah.

922
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,300
You're recording me, aren't you?

923
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,460
I'm telling you not to call me again.

924
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,100
We've all been drinking Theme Crush now.

925
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,260
Yes, apparently.

926
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,060
What are the effects of the Theme Crush drink itself?

927
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,020
It makes you break dreams.

928
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,320
Oh, the break...

929
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,020
Oh, much like the break wind of the...

930
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,520
Yes, the break wind of the break dreamers often clogs these busy mall arcades, causing

931
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,740
merchants to get out on the sidewalk and fuss and fume at the blocked aisles and the lack

932
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,360
of customers.

933
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,280
And they often, what they do, they use what they call the dancing flame, and I think that's

934
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:23,760
pretty...

935
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,400
Oh, I see.

936
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,680
And then, just how do they carry the flame about the park?

937
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,200
Exactly.

938
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,900
Exactly.

939
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,420
That's the problem.

940
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,060
It's a giant match.

941
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,340
Scientists have been trying to decide this problem for years.

942
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,160
Here they are now.

943
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:33,580
Oh, I see.

944
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:33,580


945
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,960
I understand that this ceremony of the dancing flame is so secret that only a few people in

946
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,720
the world can claim to have seen it and survived.

947
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,920
Don't forget, you're hearing it described blow by blow here on the fabulous theater

948
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,780
of the upper air.

949
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,540
Good effort.

950
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,220
Yes, it's the Good Effort Show where we recognize those citizens who show good effort and citizenship.

951
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,860
Our first good effort is little Bobby Brundage who was trod on by a cart horse while watching

952
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,880
the Budweiser Clydesdales pass in the Thanksgiving Day parade.

953
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,820
Oh, good effort, Bobby.

954
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,140
And here's Bobby's body being shown on display.

955
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,560
Oh, disgusting, isn't it?

956
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,760
We'll swipe that away and show you the next good effort winner.

957
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,520
Yes, and our second award today goes to little Norman Darniti who made the attempt at being

958
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,160
a high school athlete and ended up, well, in a funny little chair.

959
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,340
Well, she's flitter-sized.

960
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,380
She's flitter-sized.

961
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:15,920
She can go anywhere.

962
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,740
That's not a pleasant sight.

963
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,880
Good effort, Norman.

964
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,760
Good effort, Norman.

965
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,800
Thanks a lot for the slide.

966
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,280
Okay, here's our third winner.

967
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,460
And our final good effort is Palmer Marinerz.

968
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,540
Yes, Palmer attempted to couple with another human being of an opposite species.

969
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,900
The doctors told us afterwards that we were clinically dead.

970
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,680
What did his smile look like?

971
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:31,740
Yeah.

972
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,120
Some of them awoke up and said, oh, I'm going to die.

973
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,120


974
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,300
I'm going to die.

975
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,300


976
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,720
Good teeth.

977
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,160
It was hard, but the blood in our eyes that had this kind of ray that made the blood in

978
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,400
our eyes kind of coagulate and kind of start bulging out.

979
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,160
Well, good try, Paul.

980
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,240
Yeah, good effort.

981
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,560
We were all watching you on the Visigroup, Paul, and although your antics on the interocitor

982
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,900
left a little something to be desired, we thought you deserved at least a T for effort.

983
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,320
Yeah.

984
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,780
Thanks, Paul.

985
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,520
Good effort.

986
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:53,900
Good try.

987
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,580
Thank you.

988
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,420
And that's the primary purpose.

989
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,400
Of this show.

990
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,100
Yes, friends, and you have been listening to the Church of the Lord.

991
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,100


992
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,100


993
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,680
You've been listening to the Subgenius Hour of Slack with some excerpts there from the

994
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,800
Subgenius Show from KPFA, Berkeley with puzzling evidence and Dr. Hal Palmer, Vredes, and Gary

995
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,460
Gabrogfram from back in 1984.

996
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,020
And before that, I want to suck your blood by John Bartleson.

997
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:23,980
You can get your blood sucked by writing for free information from Post Office Box 140306,

1004
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,940
And friends, those of you in Cleveland area, Ohio area, be aware that we've got a revival

1005
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,700
in Columbus, October 26th, 27th at a bar called Stash's.

1006
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,340
And you can call Stash's in Columbus for information, free information.

1007
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:02,960
Yeah.

1008

Yeah.

1010
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,060


1011
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,180
Thank you.

Well, thanks for being here.

1013
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:38,780

1015
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,140
Thanks.

1016
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,140


1017
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,180
Thanks.

1018
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:39,180


1019
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:39,180


1020
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,260
Thanks.

1021
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,260


1022
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,260


1023
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,260


1024
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,260


1025
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,260


1026
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,280
Thanks.

1027
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,300


1028
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,300


1029
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,300


1030
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,320
Bye.

1031
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,680
Bye.

1032
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,000
Bye.

1033
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,600
Bye.
