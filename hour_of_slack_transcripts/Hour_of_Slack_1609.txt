I'm fired up and ready to go.
Well, but I'm...
I'm hearing you,
but I'm not hearing you on my tape recording.
Oh, there we go.
You know what it was, Dave?
That feels better, doesn't it?
Well, it feels like somebody
raspated a liquid all over
so many cuerpos.
I shoved it all the way in
is what I did.
It wasn't very far in.
You probably thought it was.
It was.
Well, that's what you say
when you're the bastard child of Satan
in Hades.
But I'm not.
You're not.
No, I'm the bastard son of Pappy and Mammy.
Only, I'm not a bastard.
No, not at all.
As far as we know.
Pappy and Pappy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This portion of programming
is brought to you by
Bob's Steakhouse
on the corner of Hursuit and Flushing
in beautiful Stane, California.
Come on down to Bob's
and get a mouthful of meat
from the man himself.
If you'd like to make a reservation,
please call 1-800-555-13013.
Yeah, okay.
I'll tell you what,
we're going to get into all of that.
Don't worry, man.
Don't worry.
You don't have no program.
Just relax.
When I say toilet paper,
that's when you come rolling out, okay?
Some of my friends
have prepared a song
that they desire you to hear.
And I would appreciate it
if you would listen to it.
Also, please play it for your friends.
And even after election day,
please run it off once in a while
to remind you that I am in Washington
and will be watching you.
I'm reaching out for your interest.
The song will now be sung
by the Lang and Glee Club.
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?
Are you a blank vampire?
Are you caught in the Transylvanian transvestite
time trap, Melvin Laird?
Honk, honk,
for the geese of Canada.
Quack, quack,
for the ducks of derision
late at night
when the moon is full.
Do you creep
through the crypt?
And blip from throat to throat,
Melvin Laird?
Cause I saw you grinning
with a drool a-dripping
on the TV screen
testifying with your vacant voice
for the ABM machine.
I could swear I saw two fangs
touching the microphone.
So I'm carrying my wafer.
I'm carrying my cross
just in case I find you
breathing down my neck.
In the silent halls
of Congress, Melvin Laird.
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?
Are you a blank vampire?
And it's starting with
verse one of chapter four.
It says,
Dear friends,
do not believe every spirit,
but test the spirits
to see whether they are from God,
because many false prophets
have gone out into the world.
It is a quest.
It's a quest for Bob.
We're going to Bob
the entire Cleveland area tonight
yet again.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
We're Uber women
going into Kinko's
to make thousands of Bob faces.
Thousands and thousands
and thousands of Bob faces.
Billions upon billions.
And then we're going to scatter them.
Yay!
Unto the masses.
Unto the masses.
And first Timothy 4.1 says
that there are false prophets
that go around teaching doctrines of devils.
This is a doctrine
that I feel are the devil.
Second Chronicles 11, 14 to 15 says,
he says, don't be surprised
because the Satan will appear
as an angel.
He says, don't be surprised

as an angel of light.
I know you think, well,
it's just an innocent,
fun little holiday for kids
to go out and dress up.
Well, we need to, you know,
to really investigate
and find out what the origins
and we need to be honest
with ourself and say,
I'll now take a look around
and see what can be found.
A bicycle seat can be pretty neat.
An electric toothbrush
will give you a rush.
A handy cucumber is a fine number.
A dozen drumsticks
will make you tick.
And don't forget,
we told you so.
Get loose.
Float juice.
Get loose.





The best sex can be found at home.
All by yourself.
Sitting alone.
Get loose.
Float juice.
You got ten fingers,
use them, baby.
Optical illusion game?
Right here.
Ah.
Uh-huh.
Chicka-pow-pow.
Up to the mountains,
click, click, click.
Down to the trees,
is it, is it Nick?
Ho, ho, ho, I will po.
Ho, ho, ho, I will glow.
Weemaw-maw made up a song.
Reindeer keep falling on my roof.
And I'm gonna take some pictures
and then I'll have proof.
Reindeer on the roof.
Weemaw, you're crazy.
Weemaw, you're crazy.
That song is amazing.
Reindeer keep falling on my head.
They keep falling.
You are crazy, D-Dawg.
Because I'm crazy.
Because I'm Bob.
Stop, that is terrible singing.
And I can always be a slob.
You are the worst singer ever.
That is super doofy.
Hey, I am the host of this show.
You are doofy.
Yeah, that's why I'm the host of this show.
Yeah, that's probably why.
Friends, welcome to Hour of Slack,
number 1,600 and something.
Yeah, let's start singing.
Everybody dance now.
And we have my grandson, Elias, as a guest today.
Everybody dance now.
Elias, what have your parents told you about Bob?
Bob?
Yeah, what do you know about Bob?
Well, he's your company.
He looks crazy.
He's a UFO.
And he likes carrots.
He likes carrots?
Did they tell you Bob likes carrots?
Everybody dance now.
That was so they could get you to eat carrots.
Come on, Elias, eat your carrots.
Bob loves carrots.
Not so sure about peas, though.
That's where he gets his mighty super strength, from carrots.
Yeah, I like carrots.
I like carrots and carrots.
Would you eat a baby carrot?
That would be disgusting.
It's just a baby.
His whole life is ahead of it.
No, that would be disgusting.
You eat baby.
I've seen you eat baby carrots.
No.
They're so young and tender.
What do you mean the eyes and the nose?
They're like young.
Especially the drool.
The drool?
Mm-hmm.
You like the drool?
What are you?
Like the fruit stand that turns into a filling station.
But the footprints and signs from the past are everywhere.
They've been fighting over this land ever since the first Spanish missionary showed the Indians the benefits of religion, horses, and a few years of forced labor.
But the Indians had it right all along.
They respected ghosts.
Memories are like that, as unpredictable as nitro, and you never know what's going to set one off.
Like the clues that keep you on the right track are never where you look for them.
They fall out of the pocket of somebody else's suit you pick up at the cleaners.
They're in the tune you can't stop humming that you never heard in your life.
They're at the other end of the wrong number you dial in the middle of the night.
The signs are in all those old familiar places you only think you've never been before.
But you get used to seeing them out of the corner of your eye, and you end up tripping over the ones that are right in front of you.
We all sugarcoat this because this isn't the right time to base your mindset regarding our遠 objet.
Here's another ballet eğmincí song.
This guy has a gurwaysh uyh- governan ME of horny ànt�
dans el océán
What are you doing, Dad?
I'm developing a compound that, when applied to the soles of shoes,
keeps gum from sticking to them.
What a wonderful gift to mankind.
I'm kind.
Con, what are you going to do today?
I'm very busy.
After I rake a perfect crosshatch pattern in the pea gravel in the driveway,
I'm going to change the air in the spare tire of the station wagon.
I'd better make some sandwiches.
I sound regular.
Here, I'll turn off the...
Data.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Elias.
Nothing.
Yes, this is a special hour of Slack,
recorded here at Tarzan's Rite Aid Station,
with...
Elias, our guest, our special guest.
He's running his own mic volume control.
He keeps it up pretty hot.
Yeah, because I like it.
Yeah, because you like it.
Because I can scream.
When it's super high, I can scream, and it'll be like this.
Everybody dance now.
Or you can whisper.
Okay.
You're going to make me deafer.
Everybody dance now.
Chicka-chicka-boom-boom.
Chicka-chicka-boom.
Chicka-chicka-boom-boom.
Stop that nonsense.
That's called over-modulating, Elias, when you turn it up too high.
Everybody dance now.
Nice.
Look, I'm whispering.
Everybody dance now.
Everybody dance now.
Be quiet.
Somebody might be listening.
Shh.
Humans.
There's humans all around.
Feedback.
There's feedback all around.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
The Green Boys were here at Stang Ranch this weekend.
And, oh, we had so much fun.
And I feel real good, which is not bad, considering that.
This time last week, I was on my back hooked up.
I was on my back hooked up to machines that go ding,
looking at a screen showing a mess of quivering spaghetti,
which was my actual heart,
through which a Dr. Simpson was snaking a tiny tube up from my groin
to attach a little metal mesh tunnel or stent,
where there had just been a seriously clogged little section of artery,
90% obstructed.
Jeepers.
No wonder it hurt.
It hurt so much.
But the rest of my heart tubes looked fine, and my cholesterol level was normal.
So go figure.
What I want to know is when do I get to lie in a bed, being flown around in a helicopter,
with a beautiful view, really high on morphine, but not while having a heart attack?
Because that would be fun.
It was sort of funny while having the heart attack, which the doctor described as a, quote,
PG-rated heart attack that didn't do much damage.
And now I have to take four pills a day for a year.
And this happened right after bragging on the internet that I wasn't on any medication.
Pride cometh before a fall, my friends.
So that's why we had a rerun last week.
And one reason why I'm here.

Why we had my two grandkids here this week.
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.
Uh, Elias discovers feedback.
That ought to recharge the hearing aid batteries.
The awfulest noise in the world.
Makes my teeth hurt.
Ow!
He's hurting my teeth!
No, it's in my brain making stuff!
My fillings hurt!
My fillings!
My fillings!

I'm ready to get you some love!
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.

Bleh!

Bleh!
Bleh!
This show makes listeners sick.
But it makes the participants even sicker.
What?
Poor Elias.
The show is making Elias sick.
In fact, I don't feel so good myself.
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!

Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!





Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
How many unacceptable promises have I had these last months?
I just don't believe you.
Hey, 장구� inscreсь Ex olhar,
Why are you희
What?
How come this girlhat did that?
Sir, will you explain Bob?
Bob!
I'm glad you asked that.
But his reputation!
You're heading for trouble.
Now boys, come with me.
Goodbye Fernanda Nende.
Lemur.
Princess Wee is trying to troll.
Princess Wee is gonna troll?
The boy.
The boy?
I have an eyeball.
An extra eye.
You are creepy, dude.
It's called my third eye.
And I have an extra nostril behind my nose.
Can you see it?
And I have a third ear inside my mouth.
But he's disgusting!
And I have a ninth kidney, which you can't see it.
Bob?
Oh my!
Bob?
Oh my!
I'll tell ya!
Bob?
Bob?
Of course!
Don't!
Don't!
Don't!
Don't!
Bob?
Gosh!
Yeah, it'd be good!
Oh!
Bob?
Ah!
Five!
Bob?
Father!
And with all this crazy action going on, it looks like we're gonna be moving to Texas
permanently, but not for several summers.
Partly due to X Day and Starwood.
And, uh...
After that, I guess I'll just have to drive to Ohio like everybody else.
Cause, you know, there's no way we're gonna miss X Day and Starwood.
Starwood?
That's where men wear skirts and girls wear no shirts.
So we're not gonna miss that.
Oh, speaking of which, this music in the background is by Mayan Ruins, who always play at Starwood.
So, uh...
Anyway, what better place than Stang Ranch, friends, since the nearest town happens to
be fabled, shadowed, eldritch Glen Rose, Texas.
Which, it turns out, even more than I knew, is the perfect place for the Church of the
Subgenius.
Cause we're not the first weird cult for Glen Rose, Texas.
In fact, I've been reading this history book.
About Glen Rose.
By Gene Fowler and the Somerville County Historical Commission.
And it turns out that a hundred years ago, this little town was a mecca of crackpots, charlatans, quacks and cult leaders.
And a center for illegal drug manufacture, prostitution and pseudoscience.
Even more so than now!
Uh...
Ever since my parents moved here, I've been in the middle of the world.
And I've always knew that people used to come here, back in the day, for the healing mineral waters in the sanitariums, as they called them.
And the river going through town is lined with these wonderful old buildings that are now hotels and antique malls.
But they used to be, quote, sanitariums.
I didn't really know what that meant back then, but today I was reading through that old book and I learned a whole lot more.
This town was like the Sedona of its day.
It was a new age hotbed,
partly because it had hot springs or mineral waters.
And what they meant by that was the hideously foul sulfurous groundwater
that most people spend a lot of money to filter out these days.
Well water, right?
Well water isn't always pure, you know.
Often it's horribly tainted stuff that smells like rotten eggs.
And that crap is what the pinks were paying extra for to drink and bathe in.
Like I say, it was kind of a new age fad.
And I mean, we get city water now.
But we used to have well water.
There's a pump 300 feet below my house that pulls water from the same aquifer
those rich people were paying extra for.
And we have free water.
We have four machines to filter out all the iron, sulfur, microorganisms, and everything.
But yeah, rich idiots paid extra and made themselves sick with disgusting chemicals
that we spend extra to remove.
But I guess history proves that you can fool well, well, at least almost half the people all the time.
Anyway,

These sanitarium doctors were practicing, they weren't just selling you on soaking in the poisonous water.
They were practicing magnetic healing, popularized by the great crackpot Franz Mesmer in the olden days.
They were locally known as rubbing doctors because they used massage, hypnosis, magnets,
and especially these marvelous new healing inventions called vibrators,
which when a learned doctor applied them to certain parts of a woman's body in certain trained expert ways,
they could fairly quickly cure a woman of hysteria, as they called it in those days, or depression,
especially with regular repeated treatments.
And apparently,
very few husbands were schooled in those mysterious hysteria cures back then.
And I've learned so much sordid history.
There was a, I had, let's see, okay, I'm gonna read from this book a little bit
about my favorite Glen Rose Maverick folk healer.
Actually, there are two of them that were brothers.
Doctor, and this is back in the 1890s.
Doctor R.G. Milling, Sr., a part Cherokee magnetic healer known as the Indian Adept,
and the long-haired doctor, added therapeutic suggestion to his massage and faith healing treatments
after witnessing a, quote, Hindu hypnotist, unquote, demonstrate his art in Glen Rose in the 1890s.
Though R.G. Sr. practiced elsewhere,
younger brother G.R.,
R.G. Milling, shown here,
and he is a dapper gent with long, dark hair,
set up shop in Glen Rose in 1911.
The sheriff was a frequent visitor to G.R.'s sanitarium,
but not for treatment.
Charges lodged against the independent spirited healer
ranged from driving his Hupmobile down Barnard Street
in excess of the 18 miles,
and a mile per hour speed limit,
to disturbing a religious congregation.
Which makes me imagine, you know, him, this Indian healer, long-haired doctor, hypnotist,
running into the Baptist church and, you know, trying to cast in the money changers out of the temple,
and ranting, and, well, I like to think that, anyway.
G.R. was, which also stands for Glen Rose, G.R. Milling,
was also nabbed for toting a bell.
He was also nabbed for using a pistol in town,
which, by the way, is now completely legal,
and once for unlawfully shooting a gun across a public road.
They still frown on that.
A few cases involved his going on a bender,
and another alleged the doctor had threatened to take a life.
In September 1914, he was killed near the courthouse
by blasts from a double-barreled shotgun,
possibly by the irate husband of a female priest.

The doctor was a very tragic patient.
The fact that magnetic healers were sometimes called Rubbin' doctors
might explain the act of tragic passion.
And, yeah, I read elsewhere that the townsfolk raised the money
for the bail of the guy who shot Milling very, very quickly.
Now, there was a Dr. Snyder who had the biggest sanitarium.
His biographer described him as, quote,
a little wizard and a real human X-ray, unquote,
with clairvoyant powers.
The special advantage he has over the regular MD,
or even specialists, is his ability to read the patient's mind.
And he had a great clinic right up against the Paluxy River.
One day he kicked all his patients out after learning
they had been slipping across the river to see
a fortune teller explaining that he could not heal
under such, quote, mental cross-currents, unquote.
Snyder's patients sat in chairs for the magnetic treatment
while the wizard or one of his staff healers
rubbed away illness with firm motions
that caused a finger snap at the end of each stroke.
So it was like,
out, bad pain.
Out, bad pain.
Something like that, I guess.
Sounds great.
He had a wondrous ability to restore sight.
Although here's a humorous anecdote.
Even legendary Texas rancher Charles Goodnight
visited the sanitarium in the 1920s seeking help for his eyes.
One old farmer, seeing the ostrich cavort about,
shouted,
That bird is as big as a bird!
It's as big as a cow!
Those fellers have ruined my eyes!
In addition to Judy the ostrich,
the ground housed a peacock, a baby alligator,
wolves, and other animals.
It just houses tourists now.
I was outside there playing Pokemon Go
just a couple hours ago.
Another noted Texan who sought the Snyder treatment,
controversial preacher J. Frank Norris,
stayed at Snyder's while in Glen Rose
for a tent revival.
Quote,
In 10 minutes conference,
he reported the minister known as the Texas Tornado,
not to be confused with the late wrestler,
the Texas Tornado, Von Erich.
In 10 minutes conference,
he gave me information worth $10,000.
He took my appendix out of my head.
For you see, I thought I had it.


I had a bad appendix,
although operated on for appendicitis some years ago.
Snyder told me there was only a stub left.
Consequently, my appendicitis was only in my head.
And he took it out.
I guess it worked.
So, yeah, those old,
the old buildings covered with beautiful petrified wood brick,
are all over town with non-healers living in them now.
Now, there's another type of healing going on in Glen Rose
during Prohibition called bootlegging.
And this area was the moonshine capital of Texas.
And in fact, we have a couple of areas on Stang Ranch,
which I'm pretty certain now are the sites of old stills.
There's, we call one of them the haunted still grottoes.
And the other place is called Corn Squeezing Corner,
where he found thousands of rusty barrel hoots
and bootlegging equipment.
Anyway, there's also haunted houses in town.
Actually, haunted houses of prostitution,
to be specific.
They're beautiful old abandoned petrified wood places,
as seen on my YouTube channel.
And they're full of the ghosts of,
of ancient hookers and johns.
So these weren't just honky tonks.
One thing they didn't mention in the history books
is the Ku Klux Klan,
but I think that was going on here.
Anyway, all this made me add a name
to our roadside attraction.
You know, we are in the process of building
a subgenius roadside attraction.
It is very much going to be an attraction
in competition with the Creation Evidence Museum
down the road.
It's going to be called now,
we've changed the name to
the Destructionist Evidences Museum and Sanitarium.
Okay, and friends, it's coming along pretty well.
We've, we have ex, we moved the devil skeleton
and the Adam and Eve skeletons over,
so that, over to a concrete slab
so we can display them.
And, you'll see, there's all kinds of stuff coming along.
Now, a couple of weeks ago,
we went to the local Creation Evidence Museum, finally.
It's been here for like 25 years, maybe longer.
And its proprietor,
quote, doctor, unquote, Carl Baugh,
has been hunting yeti tracks out here for a long time.
In fact, he even,
talked my dad into letting,
getting my brother to help him remove
one of our dinosaur tracks.
And I think I may have seen it in his museum.
Uh, which has some beautifully crafted elements
right next to laughably inappropriate fakes
of near bull dot of badness.
There's some really good, valuable, real fossils
right next to the most,
most homemade looking,
baloney evidence you ever saw.
For instance, you can see the footprints of humans
superimposed with the footprints of dinosaurs,
as if they were made right at the same time.
And, indeed, Dr. Baugh says they were made,
they were made when the dinosaurs and the people were
fleeing the flood of Noah.
Which is when, uh,
all fossils were formed.
Five or six thousand years ago.
I don't know their exact, uh, dating.
Although there's gorgeous, huge,
wall-sized kook diagrams
all over this museum,
this Creation Evidence Museum,
with great artwork on par with any Jehovah's Witness pamphlet.
And believe me, the Jehovah's Witness set the standard
at this kind of thing.
Uh, he's got a 25-foot long replica,
of Noah's Ark,
with, and, and he very carefully stocked it with,
like, there'll be one room with
a boy and girl, uh, sheep,
and a boy and girl triceratops.
And another little room of the Ark with a,
uh, a male and female lion,
and a male and female moronodon.
You know, and, uh, all portrayed by
the good kind of hand-painted dinosaur toys
from Safari Limited, not the cheap Chinese junk.
The Noah's Ark looks great.
And his fossils look great,
but there's all these, uh, plaques and things
insisting that the fossils
all were made in a matter of hours.
Not over a period of thousands or millions of years,
but in a matter of hours or days
immediately following the deluge of the Bible.
And that was when
the earliest race of men,
which Dr. Baugh has taken upon himself to name,
Homo Baugh Anthropus.
Yes, he walked with his sandals
along the Pilexi River banks,
just alongside the dinosaurs.
And, uh, you know, they, a lot of,
I guess they, I guess they had to die,
and the water crushed all the dinosaur bones
and tracks and sand
and turned them into different minerals
in a matter of just a few hours.
And this should be obvious to any...
Christian.
But the Creation Evidence Museum
has some really surreal additions
that have nothing at all to do with the Bible
or dinosaurs or Noah's Ark
or giant man tracks in the fossil rock.
For instance, there is an excellent
eight-foot-tall sculpture of Tom Landry,
the former Dallas Cowboys coach,
towering over the figure next to it,
which is a plain ordinary pink boy store mannequin
dressed in an Indian headdress.
Okay.
A half-size Indian next to a giant white man
who's a famous Christian.
Anyway, we came away from the Creation Evidence Museum
feeling that we're surrounded by cavemen
who are pretending that they are studying cavemen.
And hence our wonderful, uh, attractions
our roadside attraction,
Destructionist Evidence Museum, and so forth,
which we are constructing here
just outside of Glen Rose, Texas.
It's on the other side of town from the other attractions.
So, as I've mentioned before on the show,
we have Jackalope and Longhorn Armadillo Petting Zoo,
ghost dinosaur tracks,
fossil skeletons of Adam and Eve.
Actually, they're not.

Their name was Steve and Eve,
but, you know, to attract the tourists,
we'll say it's Adam and Eve.
Same difference.
The ghost dinosaur tracks, did I mention those?
A devil skeleton, an alien skeleton,
the remains of Noah's Ark where it sank.
And you can see all this stuff for five bucks
if you visit the Destructionist Evidence Museum
once we get it open.
Do you dare to turn back and see the thing?
Or the man-eating chicken?
Anyway, that's all coming along.
And another good reason to be here
is that my grandsons and my daughter and her husband
and my son and his wife
all live in Dallas only a couple hours away,
and they get to come visit us all the time.
Hey, Luscious Pooh!
See, he won't play unless he can control the whole world.
That's why I think he's gonna grow up to be a super villain.
Super hero.
He is a super villain in the making.
I wanna scream into that one, too.
No screaming.

Bye!
Screaming only at X Day, not in the studio.
Not in the studio.
If you wanna scream, you have to come to X Day.
No, leave those things alone.
He is like a control freak, and so are you.
Everybody's a control freak except me.
That's why I should be in control.
Because I'm a control master.
Alexander!
Not control freakazoid like my family.
Alexander, come be on the show.
Yay!
Alexander!
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Alexander, you know?
Do you remember this?
You got it from your stocking.
Whenever you talk, it goes into our headphones.
Did I?
I thought this was a skeleton.
But it's not.
You're welcome.
You've noticed I've been...
I can't believe it.
Have you noticed this skeleton all over the house?
You're the craziest brother ever.
What?
Have you noticed that there are skeletons all over this house?
No.
This is skeleton house, a fossil house.
Wow.
Hey.
I always thought this face was a skeleton.
It is.
That's a skull candy.
Oh no, it's not.
It's Edgar Allan Poe.
That's the great poet.
Edgar Allan Poe.
That's where they came up with the name.
Poe.
That's where they came up with the name.

They named poets.
What does the fox say?
They said, hey man, did you write a poem?
You really Poe'd it.
Hey, I'm going to write a poem.
I'll Poe it.
And that's how poems came to be.
Did you know that?
God almighty.
You know, it is challenging to do shows with six-year-old evil geniuses and eight-year-old
saintly geniuses.
What characters they are.
Okay.
It's the hour of snack now.
Ta-da.
With music.
Then I'll take that back to you.
So, we are going to be joined by the doofy Dee-Daw.
That's me.
And the crazy Alexander.
Yeah, he's definitely crazy.
But there's only one thing we have to worry about.
The time in King's Castle.

















The time in King's Castle.
Okay.
We're doing the hour of snack now again.
I have two guests.
Elias and Alexander.
Hold on.
Stop the movie.
Stop the movie.
We need a press.
We didn't restart.
Okay.
We have to restart.
So.
Okay.
Take 190.
Action.
Since now you don't know what just happened, we are going to be joined by the doofy Dee-Daw.
That's me.
And the Alexander.
So, we are going to do the hour of snack.

We're going to be making a movie that's going to be Monster Hunter.
Data talk.
Monster Hunter.
We're making a movie?
Data talk.
Who's going to play the monster?
I will.
No.
I will.
I'm playing the monster.
My plan worked.
My evil plan worked.
I will.
My evil plan worked to get them fighting against each other.
I'm going to be the monster.
Let's start.
Oh, yay.
What's Bob going to do?
He's going to be the floor.
The floor.
Okay, Bob will be the floor in this Monster Hunter movie.
He often shows up in strange roles.
Yeah, he's a...
Things like floors and shower curtains and washing machines.
Maybe he'll get killed by...
I saw Bob on TV last night and he was playing a chair.
Maybe he'll...
Maybe.
Could we start the movie now?
Maybe.
Maybe.
Hi, friends.
Welcome to Hour of Slime number 10,590,000.
Starring Elias and Alex.
No, that's too high.
That's too high.
It needs to be the...
They're here to talk about everything except Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subterranean.
Because I know everything about that and they know everything else.
Bob is dead in the bathtub.
What?
I heard that.
I know you heard it.
You said Bob is dead in the bathtub.
Did you say Bob is dead?
No, I said Bob is dead in the bathtub.
Yes, friend, I can bathe in Bob.
Now Bob is dead in the car.
What?
Who's driving it?
My most vivid recollection of Bob was on the ground outside.
I said, excuse me, Bob.
He said, I'm gonna let you die.
I've always thought that Bob was a lonely outcast with that smile.
I love Bob's death.
Why do you have to sit away about it at home?
I love Bob.
I understand.
Although he doesn't have to resort to using ropes.
All he has to do is look at them and they do what he wants.
He's the only one that they'll obey like that.
But there's kind of a fad going on.
I think it started, somebody in Oregon started it,
but it, oh, it's spread all across the country.
Goat yoga.
And this is not a joke.
People who need relaxation
go to a place,
where there are goats,
and they let the goats walk on them.
Actually, it's baby goats that walk on you.
Because the big ones will probably urinate on you.
The little ones might too,
but it's not nearly as stinky.
And my brother was doing this two or three years ago.
He'd invite people to let these,
he'd get down on his hands and knees,
and the little baby goats would spring onto his back
and walk around.
And he'd kind of slide down
on his belly and let them walk back and forth on his back.
And it feels real good.
I've done it.
It does feel great to have baby goats tread upon your back.
There's no question about that.
I read today some people calling it the latest
in new age, charlatan idiocy.
But in fact, it does feel really good.
I guess you could dress up the yokes.
You could have part of a 아ंка.
There are those little flatts around it.
Those little dots.
And that's exactly the way people want to dress up.
They all look pretty.
They all go in circles.

It was also the SALT collection,

Of course, they're all covered in Wales nessa

Could we make that Monster Hunter movie now?
Hey, did you hear my new prayer?
No.
Okay, this is before dinner.
When you're ready to eat dinner, you say,
Dog is great, dog is good,
but dog cannot have our food.
Amen and amen.
Amen and amen.
Could we make that monster?
Yeah, I think we could.
Guys, guys, okay.
You're the strongest monster.
You're a lady that doesn't do anything.
I'm going to choose what monster I'm going to be.
I'm a lady who doesn't do anything.
Stop, stop.
I have an idea.
I have an idea.
You're the strongest monster ever.
No, I'm going to choose what monster I want to be.
Okay, which one are you?
Welcome to the Trump White House.
Let me go check real quick.
We're live here at the Trump White House.
This is the president,
Batman, and his little assistant, Donnie.
I'm going to be,
so D.R. is the black cat.
I am the Monster Hunter.
Xander is going to figure out which monster he is.
You need to stand on this side.
My problem is, these boys are bad.
They're not good boys.
They're bad boys.
I'm being with you.
They're very bad.
Elias is bad.
Not me.
I'm trying to be with you.
That's why I've been saying that Elias is going to grow up to be a James Bond supervillain.
Yeah, that's right.
Not with superpowers, just with super evil.
Yeah, I'm going to have a son with Elias.
No superpowers.
These guys have learned the subgenius way of talking all at once on the radio.
Can you stop screaming?
Yeah, that's the official subgenius technique.
Stop screaming.
Stop screaming.
Can we make that movie now?
I said that three times already.
I've started the movie three times.
No, I'm pretty sure you said it 15 times.
Okay, man.
There's a monster out there in Moga Woods.
We've got to go out there and kill him.
Well, somebody has to go out there and kill him.
I'd love to go fight that monster.
Hold on.
Hold on.
You're the black cat.
Who will volunteer to kill the monster?
I will.
I am the Monster Hunter.
And who are you?
What is your name, young Monster Hunter?
Monster Hunter.
Monster Hunter.
That's not a very clear name.
It seems quite generic.
It's rather generic, yes.
Can it be more specific?
I'm still a monster.
I'm still working this show.
This is the worst script I've ever seen.
Who wrote this?
I have no idea.
Who wrote this script?
Wait, that wasn't even a script.
Okay, let's start.
Once upon a time.
Three little.
You're supposed to say I wrote it.
Okay, once upon a time.
Okay, here's the music in the background.
We are here to hunt monsters, men.
Which monster shall we hunt?
Bob.
Let's fight him.
Bob?
Yes, we'll kill him.
The worst monster of all, Bob.
They say he's undefeatable.
Okay, I just killed him.
I just killed him.
He just looks like a bunny, though.
I just killed him.
Jump fearless.
That was easy.
I killed him.
No, he's not.
Hurley.
Hurley, let's go.
I just killed him.
Who's straight?
I'm straight.
Who's straight?

Okay.
Okay.
I give up.
I give up.
I give up.
I give up.
Add sound effects here.
Bing.
Bing.
The monster.
The monster's here.
Come on.
Let's get it.
He's too powerful.
He cannot defeat Bob.
Bob will destroy us.
He will kill us all with his slack power.
But I just got the monster hunter sword.
Run.
We need a slack powered sword to fight Bob.
Run.
I just got it.
I'm gonna run.
Okay, let's get him.
Okay, that's a good idea.
Let's run.
Run away.
Run.
Wait, wait, wait.
You know we have...
No, wait.
We'll never beat the monster this way.
Wait.
Okay, let's go back and get him.
Okay, Yamba and Cha-Cha.
Hurry.
Get him.
Okay, we'll go away.
Yamba and Cha-Cha, they will help fight Bob.
Hurry.
They're here.
They will help us destroy Bob.
I got my sword.
Oh, wait.
It's not working.
I got my sword.
Bob is selling a new mask.
Bam.
Shing.
Bam.
Bam.
Oh, no.
Bob got him on his side.
Bam.
Bam.
Bam.
Hey, look at that great sword Bob has.
I'm going to go...
Splash.
Splash.
Hey, quit killing Bob for a minute.
I want to go buy a sword from him.
Okay.
Run, run, run.
He sold me this great sword.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.

I'm going to put in the trap.
That's it.
Put in the trap.
Okay.
When he falls in, I'll put a bomb on it.
Okay.
Hurry.
Okay.
warp in.
Come on.
Quick.
Broom.
Okay.
Now, I'm going to throw a paintball.
Come on.
bullet to Bob?
He's still coming!
Bob is still coming!
Kill him!
Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
Bang!
Slash!
I think he just fell asleep while we were trying to kill him.
Stop it, Andrew!
He wasn't fighting back.
Arch!
It hasn't hurt him.
Slash!
Nothing will stop him.
Slash!
Bullets cannot stop him.
Slash!
I'm going to slash him into pieces.
Gah!
Slash!
He's smiling.
I think he likes it.
He's getting turned on.
This is gross!
What were we...
That's the monster right there, too!
He's Bob.
It's Bob.
That's how he likes being killed.
One more bomb.
That makes...
The skull bomb!
The skull face bomb!
Slash!
It makes him laugh.
No, it doesn't make him laugh.
Oh.
Since it makes him laugh...
It would make him dead because he likes being hit so much.
Three, two, one, go!
It worked!
Yay!
He's dead!
Now we just have to go have armor and...
His armor and his weapon.
Yay!
Yay!
Let's go back home.
That man is Bob.
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!

Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Fernanda Nande-Lemore.
Oh, did I mention the other bootlegging that was done in Glen Rose
was dinosaur track bootlegging.
The town, of course, is famous for the really well-preserved,
various different series of dinosaur tracks all along the Paluxy River
and also the tributaries.
We have our own lesser, somewhat smaller dinosaur tracks
on our own property.
And they're real, and there's no question.
If you look at these things, you go, yeah, a big animal definitely did this.
This is not just by chance.
But back in the 20s, they were somewhat more exotic,
and the very same fellow who had brought the dinosaur tracks
to the attention,
the first person in town who knew they were dinosaur tracks
and not devil tracks,
was a high school principal who then alerted paleontologists
at this New York Museum of Natural History, I think.
So anyway, this teenager had discovered the tracks,
and when he grew up, he made bootleg dinosaur tracks
and sold them.
They looked absolutely unrealistic, but...
And I think Dr. B...
Bob will sell you dinosaur tracks too,
although I don't think he tries to insist that they're real.
They're just decorative.
Yep, this is an interesting and wonderful town.
It's a sleepy town.
I go into the post office every day, just about,
and you can write to us.
You can send us stuff.
The eventual permanent Church of the Subgenius
will be...
Got your pencil ready?
And it's this way all through the winter and spring and fall months.
Subgenius, post office box 807.
That's it.
Box 807.
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.
Also, subgenius.com.
Also, during the...
During the...
Late spring and summer, early fall.
The official subgenius...
Still the official subgenius headquarters is in Cleveland Heights, Ohio,
where it's 33 degrees when I'm saying this.
It was 80 degrees here in Texas.
Yes, yes, yes.
So, thank you.
And now this.
Well, we're home again.
Let's eat.

Yum, yum, yum, yummy.
That more lemon on belly sure is yummy.
Tough, though.
Chewy.
Okay, who's going to throw up now?
I just ate the guts.
I will.
That was a good meal.
I just ate the guts.
That was a good meal.
Mine was terrible.
Here, some of this.
Oh, okay, I'll try that.
It's even worse.
How dare you.
I don't care that it's worse or better.
I just want to eat.
Because I'm hungry.
You want it to be worse, sir.
Here's some...
Cha-cha and cappuccino.


Chachara and chai rum bus.
Cha-cha and chai rum bus.
Here's some royal cheese.
Cha-cha and ca-yum-ba.
Here's some...
Here's some candy.
Circle.
Cha-cha and...
Square.
Here's some candy.
It's the Monster Hunter Idiot Show.
Here on Hour of Slack.
Hey, some candy.
Hey.
Why are you making me eat skull candy, Dr. Alexander?
Hey, skull candy.
Because it's so good.
Skull candy makes you throw up just so you know.
No, it's so good.
This show broke my hearing aids.
Wait, is that true?
It made my hearing aids run...
explode.
Because it sounds so bad.
Yeah, I'm always serious.
Would I kid you?
Would your grandpa kid you?
While doing a subgenius radio show?
Would your grandpa tell you some crazy story?
Yep.
Now, it's the end of the story.
Bye.
Hey, isn't there a movie called The Bad Grandpa that we haven't seen yet?
Bad Santa?
No, there's a movie called Bad Grandpa.
Wait, the music turned off.
Because I want to learn from that movie.
I want to learn how to be a really bad grandpa.
No.
I think they like the idea.
Oh, but I can't forget to credit the music, which is Mayan Ruins from their album.
Sounds like college radio.
Sacred and Profane, a lovely album by Mayan Ruins.
What is he doing?
What are you doing?
Alex, the future evil genius, Ilyas, is toying with our radio station equipment.
No!
You may not do it.
You may not know.
Hey, you meddler.
You know what that thing is?
Ilyas, you know what that thing is?
That's a layover to catch meddlers, buddy.
What's that?
It's a layover to catch meddlers.
You're a meddler.
That's a layover.
It's going to catch you.
You think that's funny?






It's a layover to catch meddlers.
And you've just been caught, buddy.
Show them there's another one in the shelf over there.
We actually do have labeled layovers to catch meddlers in this house.
You know where they came from?
Pappy.
Because Pappy was a trapper.
He's a trap maker and he made traps to catch meddlers like you.
This right here is a genuine subgenius brand layover to catch meddlers.
Good.
Right here in my hand.
Right here.
Well, look at what it says.
It's a big tube.
What are meddlers?
It says on the side, layover to catch meddlers.
And not to be used at speeds exceeding 70 miles an hour.
Wait, I'm a meddler?
Yep.
Wait, what?
Duh.
Guaranteed for the life of the meddler.
Oh, it's a little bit.
It's a little whip.
It's a little whip to whip the meddlers with.
A meddler whipper.
It is.
But I don't want to be whipped.
But I'm a meddler.
My father left traps all over this house.
I'm not a meddler.
Booby traps.
And there are a lot of boobies around here.
Boobs, I mean.
Here's some candy.
Like the birds.
Here's instructions for the layover to catch meddlers.
Ooh.
Which really is there.
Wow.
Allow layover to sit unattended in open areas in households, such as table or bookshelf.
Check occasionally for meddlers.
When meddlers are found congregating around layover,
flagellate them with soft end of layover while holding hard end in hand.
Cool.
Let's find the meddlers.
You're the meddlers.
No.
That's why I was flagellating you with the soft whip end.
That's right.
You're being flagellated.
With those flagella.
All right.
Well, friends, this has been Hour of Slack number 18,001.
Okay.
Starring Alexander and Elise.
But I don't want to do it again.
With, and no one ever wants to do it again.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
And that's the way it is here at Fossil House, Dockstock Mountain, Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Texas.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Humans.
And I also should mention the money.
The money.
The money.
On the internet.
of the show, I can mention the money. And it's $35 to become a minister in the Church of the
Subgenius and a member of the cult and get in on... Just take my word for it. It's worth it.
Well, it might not be for you, the listener, but it definitely will be for you, the listener.
I know you know how to take advantage of this sweet, sweet, sweet offer,
which includes the option of meeting other actual life subgeniuses. Isn't that challenging?
And yes, it can be. The best... Well, I can't say the best. Actually, the hardest place to meet
subgeniuses is at our X-Day celebration this summer.
You may not have heard of it, but it's a celebration of the X-Day.

heard this anywhere else but the world is coming to an end on July 5th at 7 a.m.
assuming this really is 1998 and not 2017 like they're always saying. And we've
been wrong again. In fact we've been wrong 21 times. We've had 21 X Day drills.
Anyway this is X Day 20 coming up. Yeah that's right XX. Two X's. XX Day again
and that's the week before July 5th starting very late June in southern Ohio
at Wisteria Campground. It's a lot of fun and I've almost finished an
edited video. I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time.
I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time. I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time.
But I got new equipment. Praise Zaphod. And so yeah editing video again and it's really fun and it reminded me of how much fun X Day is.
It's probably not much fun if you just sit there and watch but nobody does that.
I think the concerts we had didn't have an audience because all of the audience was on the stage.
Luckily the stage is really big.
And if you don't believe me you can see all of this stuff.
YouTube channel RevStang and I'm also putting stuff together for the Ministry of Slack TV show on Roku Network.
The specific channel on Roku is OSI 74. That stands for Outer Space International 74.
And there's a lot of other stuff on there besides subgenius.
It is a river of bulldada. A torrent. A deluge of bulldada.
There's a Noah's Ark of cultural bulldada artists floating around on top of it.
Presenting it to you and streaming it over the internet onto your television if you have one of those Roku sticks.
And they're pretty cheap and there's lots of cool stuff on there besides that.
But yeah, there's a subgenius channel. You can...
You never know. It's gonna be something different every week and it's curated by Dr. Philo Drummond.
The most powerful other subgenius corporation committee member besides myself.
And of course, JR Bob Dobbs.
But Bob doesn't concern himself with our petty affairs much.
He does, however, occasionally...
Smite us if we don't bring in enough money.
And you know, friends, it's true. I really did have a heart attack one week ago.
I was home in 24 hours but...
I guess Bob was just making a warning.
That if the subgeniuses can't...
You know, some of the Gimme Bobs out there.
I'm talking to you on Facebook especially.
The ones who don't know how to spell Bob or subgenius.
And yet they...
They'll get a little $1 Bob pin and then say,
Well, I'm a subgenius now. I can do anything.
No, sir. No, sir, ma'am.
That's not the way it works.
If you haven't sent that 35 bucks, you're still pink to Bob.
I don't know if Paul Mavridis ever actually paid 35 bucks.
He may die. He may suffer with the pinks on next day.
I did. I paid my...
It was 30 bucks when I paid.
Just before the false 1998. I got a little nervous.
I sent in my check to myself, but I didn't have to endorse it.
Reverend Nikki Deathchick stamped it with a rubber stamp of my signature.
That's how slick we were then.
And we're even slicker now. Slicker and slacker.
And you can be too, by golly.
I don't get on here and brag about how great my luck is just to brag.
It's because...
Look, if you don't get slack from the Church of the Subgenius, then it's all just a joke.
Just a lie. Just a satire. A takeoff on cults.
Somebody has to prove that you really get slack.
Why not me?
I busted ass slacklessly for 30 years.
And now I'm going to spend the next 30 years getting payback.
Payback slack. The best kind.
Ah, yes.
And so with that, once again, we're not begging money.
We're selling a really cool package of material that will keep you going.
Keep you busy for a long time.
And might just...
Well, we actually do have people say we changed their lives for the better.
Occasionally, I am told that the hour of slack, quote, got me through high school.
What's sad is that sometimes the person who's telling me that the hour of slack got them through high school is 50 years old.
That's how long we've been on.
This is, what?
32nd year.
Hour of slack number 1,609, I believe, is what this episode is.
So there you go.
But we're not going to quit.
Death can't stop us.
I kicked death's ass.
Yes, I did.
There was...
It's funny.
I've been trying to film buzzards.
Long story.
And so I've been noticing them.
And two days before my heart attack,
we noticed that instead of the...
five or seven buzzards normally hovering and soaring around this place,
there were 17.
We counted them.
And I have a picture.
Hovering over the house.
Two days later, I had a heart attack.
When I came home, I went out looking for buzzards to film,
and they'd all gone away.
Like, hey, we thought we was going to have a good meal off that tough old bastard.
But he didn't die.
So we're going to have to head off, boys, for deader pastures.
But they did actually...
return today.
And I did get the shot I was looking for.
So you see, everything's just perfect.
Here on Stang Ranch.
Outside of our...
machine gun...
defended...
barbed wire covered fence...
of our compound.
Things may not be that good.
Although, frankly, when I drive into town,
it still looks like the same old America it always has.
But...
that may be because nobody's talking about...
it.
And I managed not to this whole show.
Praise Bob!
Shhh!
Humans!
