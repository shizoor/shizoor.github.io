1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,740
This is an emergency. All stations position red.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,360
Godzilla alert level three. All personnel to action stations.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,900
Hey, what's this?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,340
What's that?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,340
It's a...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Subgenius Power of Swag.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,360
Get from me!

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,360
Son of a bitch!

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,360
Hello. Hello, sir. It's lovely to see you again. Are you well?

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,660
It's a Godzilla-saur.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,580
What's a Godzilla-saur?

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,120
Hey, wait. You can't come in here. It's off limits. You can't stay here.

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,960
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,480
Absolutely.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,480
It seems dogs don't leave places like this.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,480


17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,480


18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,800
Please even a statue of Godzilla will not gradually come to my service.

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,340
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,740
And the other knew him

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,420
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

22
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,540
And he determined what he could see

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,720
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,740
One from his own too many

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,500
And he determined what he could see

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,800
And he wore a hat

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,780
And he had a job

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,980
And he brought home the bacon

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,280
So that no one knew

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,500
Mongoloid, Mongoloid

32
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,960
His friends were unaware

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,300
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,400
Nobody even cared

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,620
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,600
One from his own too many

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,980
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,120
And he determined what he could see

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,640
And he wore a hat

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,700
And he had a job

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,900
And he brought home the bacon

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,100
So that no one knew

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,540
And the other knew him

45
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,120
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
And he determined what he could see

47
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,620
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,460
One from his own too many

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,920
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,100
And he determined what he could see

51
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,320
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,540
One from his own too many

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,980
He said, wait, not yet

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,780
Please, not yet

55
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,000
Hoping on a Videos hop

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000


57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000


58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,660
So he was was And he said

59
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:44,660


60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:44,660


61
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:44,820
On the way to America

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,540
Long reached the moon

63
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,780
And he, he said

64
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,560
A ton of former friends

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,140
Didn't want he do it

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,900
All right, so long

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,580
Robin Hood brought home the taken so that no one knew

68
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,360
Manga Lloyd

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,440
Manga Lloyd!

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,860
It determined what he...

71
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,900
It determined what he could...

72
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,760
It determined what he could do?

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,800
Alright! Next up, it looks like I've got Manx on the ramp.

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
Come on up here.

75
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,520
Everybody say hello and welcome, give a round of applause to Manx.

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,060
I was gonna write something, but then I didn't.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,400
This seems to be the next day of...

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Fuck it.

79
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,500
Fuck it!

80
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,400
Fuck it!

81
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,320
Fuck it. I'm too busy. Fuck it, I'm too broke.

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,120
Fuck it, I...

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,460
Just don't feel like going out into the world and camping.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,200
But you know what?

85
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,980
I had a sickness in my heart.

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,080
I know you felt it too.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,620
A sickness that can only be cured with one kind of medicine.

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,520
And that's coming here to fucking X-Day and hanging out with you yeti bitches.

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
That's the one!

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,760
Fortunately, I have a very good doctor.

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,660
His name is Dr. Bob...

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,480
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,980
And he gives me a prescription for slack.

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,740
As well as other things, uh, excuses and doctorates and such.

95
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,900
But, um...

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Bob is a great doctor because he knows better than to try to force businesses...

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,060
to compete with the medication department.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,100
He doesn't need to do any of that shit.

99
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,820
Because he's...

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,480
He's already got that covered.

101
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,760
In other ways, backdoor channels like he does.

102
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,360
But, um...

103
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,380
But I'm happy being here, being with you guys.

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,420
I needed it.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,780
I spent a whole year just aching to be back here with you guys.

106
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,140
Woo!

107
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,300
Because...

108
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,800
Being out in the world, I gotta tell you, it's...

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,540
It's a frightening place.

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,020
It sucks!

111
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,560
I spend way too much fucking time on Facebook and it just depresses the shit out of me.

112
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,320
You just wait two more days!

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,840
That's right, that's right.

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,060
It's coming, it's coming.

115
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,740
But, um...

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,340
Partially I've been depressed because I...

117
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,220
I took a statistics class and I...

118
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,400
I know what my odds are.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,660
I know what my odds are in the world of actually finding some true slack and some...

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,280
Some true companionship with a...

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
With an Uberfem.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,360
I gotta tell you, the odds are pretty slim.

123
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,800
You gotta...

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,040
Really find that one person out of...

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,880
What, a hundred...

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,420
One person out of like a hundred and fifty million fucking people.

127
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,700
It's insane.

128
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,840
But you know what I did a month ago?

129
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,840
I fucking found one.

130
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,900
Yeah!

131
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,840
Tell us!

132
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,040
Yeah!

133
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,040
Who are you?

134
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I met her at all places at a fucking karaoke bar.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Because she was singing my fucking music.

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,340
And I told her about Bob.

137
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,980
And she said, that sounds neat.

138
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,320
And I showed her a rise.

139
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,800
And she said, that's fucking genius!

140
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
I said, no!

141
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,700
It's subgenius!

142
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,780
She said, is there a book?

143
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,860
I said, goddamn right!

144
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,700
There's a fucking book!

145
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,960
I got four of them!

146
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,960
She said, give me that shit!

147
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,700
And you gave it to her!

148
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,260
I did!

149
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,240
You gave it to her good!

150
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,220
Hell fucking yeah, I did!

151
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,540
Yeah!

152
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,300
Praise Bob!

153
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,100
I gave her that book of the subgenius and she said, oh my, this is gonna take me a while

154
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,560
to get through.

155
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,040
There's lots of little pictures and diagrams and shit.

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Yeah, you had a lot.

157
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,960
But not only did I find an Uberfem, I found myself.

158
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,900
Because, you look at all these dating sites out there on the internet and all these companies

159
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,160
trying to hook you up with somebody.

160
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,260
There's an old adage that's full of shit that says opposites attract.

161
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,140
No dating site in the world goes out and looks for our opposites.

162
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,480
The entire search for a dating partner is only a search for yourself.

163
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,080
So if you're looking for somebody to complete you, guess what?

165
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
You're already fucking completed.

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Yes, sir.

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,420
Good luck to you.

168
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,280
You just gotta look in the mirror.

169
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,920
You just gotta look at yourself.

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,540
That's what you need.

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,260
That's what you want.

172
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,580
You just wanna fuck yourself.

173
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,440
Yes!

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes!

175
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,780
The entire search for dating is just masturbatory fantasy.

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Woo!

177
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,240
But with the opposite gender.

178
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,280
Everybody go fuck yourselves!

179
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,920
Hooray!

180
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,780
Okay, now what?

181
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
You wanna watch?

182
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,980
I don't care to watch.

183
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,060
If you feel like shit, I don't care.

184
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


185
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


186
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


187
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


188
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


189
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


190
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


191
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


192
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


193
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


194
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,060


195
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,600
You don't have to show it to me.

196
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,880
Knock yourself out.

197
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,580
No, I'm distracted.

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,500
Thank you.

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,140
Thank you for that.

200
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
I appreciate that.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Peace be with you all.

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,760
Oh!

203
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,860
Oh!

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,620
Somebody's getting laid tonight.

205
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,500
I'm gonna get stiff just like my leg.

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,200
Gonna get some roll aids.

207
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,040
Woo!

208
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,500
Woo!

209
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,000
Woo!

210
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,160


211
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200


212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200


213
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200


214
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,020
Woo!

215
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


216
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


217
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


218
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


219
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


220
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


221
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


222
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


223
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,020


224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,020
Woo!

225
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,020


226
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,020


227
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,020


228
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,020


229
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,060
So don't give up the fight because the fight is not…the only thing you got is keep

230
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,500
it going.

231
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,220
Everything that Anders said is fucking true, is gold.

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm in the teaching program.

233
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
I see that shit every fucking day.

234
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,440
Woo!

235
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,260
So hail Reverend Anders.

236
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,860
Yeah!

237
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,580
You'really inspiring.

238
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah.

239
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,940
You've got it right.

240
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,100
You need more funding.

241
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,320
They should have cut his funding.

242
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
They should have tripled it!

243
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,420
Woo!

244
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,280
Trip prodded or actually added.

245
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,060
Added.

246
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,060


247
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,060


248
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,360
added.

249
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,040
So, I'm going to turn

250
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,900
the mic back over to whoever

251
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,100
is next on the podium, or on the ramp.

252
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,780
I see somebody.

253
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,020
And Pisces will go first.

254
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
So, raise Bob!

255
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,840
Hey!

256
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,720
First of all, I want you to give

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Manx a round of applause.

258
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,840
Thank you, Reverend

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,080
Manx Darkpaw,

260
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,900
ranting at 17

261
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,240
X Day Drill.

262
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,300
Before that, we heard Devo's Mongoloid,

263
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,900
covered by Static

264
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,960
Department. And this

265
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,540
is Hour of Slack number

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
1494.5

267
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,500
XXX.

268
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,400
Another of those really loose internet-only

269
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,460
specials containing material that's too

270
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,300
rude, crude, and unattractive

271
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,740
for our beloved broadcast stations.

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,540
But, certainly

273
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,420
good enough for you podcast

274
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,500
downloading ne'er-do-wells.

275
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,200
We're nearing the end of our stash of last summer's

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,460
X Day recordings. Every summer, we record enough

277
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,520
material in one week to stretch across the next six

278
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,720
months of Hour of Slack. In minutes!

279
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,640
And yet, we still have a few

280
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,720
hear-worthy remnants left.

281
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,980
Coming up, music by

282
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,680
Reagan's Polyp, who weren't at X Day, by the way.

283
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,540
They just have CDs out.

284
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,400
Plus, a few more. But, I'm going to give you a little bit of a sneak peek.

285
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,980
Sermons from 17 X Day Drill by Pisces,

286
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,740
Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm, and Reverend Spike.

287
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,180
But first, this parable about Moses by

288
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,900
Reverend Richard Scull, as read for the

289
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,860
kiddies by Priestess Pisces. Incidentally,

290
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,240
this piece is specifically making fun of

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
the bigoted ravings of the renowned

292
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,420
subgenius hater and anti-semitic kook,

293
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,100
Michael Alcandor.

294
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,380
The Jews were

295
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,140
forced by the Freemasons to build pyramids for the

296
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,060
pharaoh of Egypt. The pharaoh, with her

297
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,080
willowing blonde hair, was worshipped by

298
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,780
the Glorps of Egypt, who did purchase

299
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,060
posters of her and watch her TV shows.

300
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,620
But the Jews were not happy. Their bagels

301
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,100
were stale, and they weren't even making

302
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,140
scale when hauling big boulders up over

303
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
the sandstone all over the friggin'

304
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,580
desert and piling them in front of MGM

305
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,360
Grand in Vegas. To make matters worse, the

306
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,880
only entertainment they were allowed was

307
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,340
a Wayne Newton show. Finally, the Jews got

308
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,340
to see their shop steward, Moses, to talk to

309
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,540
Pharah. He approached Pharah in a commanding

310
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,380
voice and said,

311
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,580
In the name of Viacom, pay my people's

312
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,640
scale. Go shove it, replied Pharah, with a

313
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,040
whip of her luscious hair. I'm a star.

314
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,780
So, Moses promised Pharah a course of seven

315
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,600
plagues. First was the plague of TV guides.

316
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,680
The TV guides for North Platte were sent

317
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,860
to Las Vegas by mistake. Then there was

318
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,700
the plague of Yugos. All the cars that

319
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,280
Pharah's people drove were forced into the

320
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,420
shops, and they all had to drive Yugos

321
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,880
for a week. It got worse. There was the

322
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,260
plague of Shatners, the plague of wiener

323
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,920
dogs, the plague of man boobs, the plague

324
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,460
of having the Dallas Cowboys as your

325
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,540
favorite team, and still the Pharah would

326
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,380
not pay Moses' people scale. The TV guides

327
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,820
were not able to pay Moses for the plague

328
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,420
of the Jewish people. Finally, Moses brought

329
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,940
forth the worst plague of all times. He called

330
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,740
the head of all Jews, who was also the head

331
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,060
of Viacom, Summer Murray Rothstein Redstone.

332
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,400
And using his great powers, he brought forth

333
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,820
the plague of being out of vogue. And lo, the

334
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,160
Pharah was replaced by a young girl with much

335
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,580
bigger tits on her TV show, and the masses

336
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,260
did not buy the Pharah's merchandise, and the

337
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,380
Pharah was no longer able to buy the merchandise.

338
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,380


339
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,380
The Pharah was no longer featured on the cover

340
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,860
of People magazine. With this, the Pharah's

341
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,460
powers of bargaining were destroyed. The people

342
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,320
of Moses were released from their contracts

343
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,340
and moved out to Los Angeles. On their way,

344
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,240
they faced the waters of Lake Powell, and there

345
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,500
was a worry of what to do. So they camped out

346
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,200
at the Holiday Inn while Moses went up to

347
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,240
the mountain to ask for directions. While Moses

348
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,860
was away, his people wandered down to the bar

349
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,160
for a happy hour. There was much drinking,

350
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,380
dancing of disco, and vomiting into toilet paper.

351
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,380


352
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
The people of Moses were all

353
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:18,860
in the same boat. Moses was angry, for Moses

354
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,540
was not invited to happy hour. So Moses held

355
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,400
up the tablet of his iPhone and cast it down

356
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,380
upon the ground. And lo, the iPhone did him a favor.

357
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,380


358
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,800
He put the tablet of his iPhone in his mouth,

359
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,320
and he put his eye out. And Moses was sued and

360
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,860
lost in court. And while the Jews moved on to

361
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,080
Hollywood, where they did make trashy, obsolete

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,440
leftist propaganda disguised as entertainment,

363
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,440
Moses was stuck being a busboy at the truck stop

364
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,420
in Needles. The end.

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,340
Now, there's another line I wrote down.

366
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,100
Oh, there's more?

367
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,900
Yeah, from Charlene, our hostess up at the

368
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,280
top of the hill. Charlene is one of the founders

369
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,000
of Wisteria, and she's put on a lot of festivals.

370
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,160
She and Princess We were talking about putting

371
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,620
on festivals as a programmer. And the line was,

372
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,840
when it rains, programming runs around with

373
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,600
Muppet arms screaming.

374
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,800
Right, because like you see when it's raining,

375
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,100
you can't have your festival.

376
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,840
It made me envision those arms on little sticks,

377
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,700
you know, they have their arms on little sticks.

378
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,080
Right outside a gas station, you know, waving

379
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,880
those arms.

380
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,020
Or a used car lot.

381
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,320
And that's what happened last year when it rained.

382
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,100
Pisces was running around with Muppet arms screaming.

383
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
Hmm. Grover and what was the other one?

384
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,580
Cheers to Mordor and Corpse, I'll tell you your flaw.

385
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,220
So perhaps your soul will hear me.

386
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,500
You had a chance to join us.

387
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,180
You had a chance to be here near me.

388
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,240
But you choose to keep your ways among the pinks now in their graves.

389
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,260
I gave you a chance to be saved.

390
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,060
And you laughed.

391
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
And now I laugh.

392
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,200
The warrant was signed in frobs, smoke, and blood.

393
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,420
Ending coming with death from above.

394
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,800
So tell me more, dear, about your God's love.

395
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,360
Because I'm not a saint.

396
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


397
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


398
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


399
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


400
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


401
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


402
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


403
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


404
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


405
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


406
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


407
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


408
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


409
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,360


410
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,240
Is he sitting with me laughing?

411
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,500
Can you hear him laughing?

412
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm watching you flailing, wasting your breath.

413
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,640
Hoping and praying to stop what comes next.

414
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,040
But your accounts are closed.

415
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,160
You're writing bad checks.

416
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,980
And I'm here to collect.

417
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm here to collect.

418
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,440
Hello?

419
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,060
I think I have another rancher up here.

420
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,880
So come on.

421
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,840
Come on.

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,960
I'll coax you.

423
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,680
Come on.

424
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,540
Everybody, give a round of applause for Wilhelm.

425
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,300
Woo!

426
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,240
Good evening, fellow musicians.

427
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,240
I have no script.

428
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm going to improvise.

429
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,220
I do read the news, and I'm aware, and I see the propaganda, and it saddens me.

430
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
I mean, I'm doing okay.

431
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,120
I have my slack, but it saddens me that there's so many that don't have slack

432
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,260
and so many that Bob has not found.

433
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,100
Unfortunately, Bob did find me.

434
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,860
I guess I'm more here to testify than I am to rant.

435
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,520
Testify!

436
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm here to represent the quiet people.

437
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,420
And as you know, or if you don't know me, I'm a pretty quiet guy,

438
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,080
and my vocabulary may not necessarily be rocketing.

439
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,540
Rocketing!

440
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,440
Yes!

441
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,720
Thank you.

442
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,980
You speak some genius.

443
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,500
What do you mean?

444
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,640
And I just wanted to share with you, for those of you that may have hard times

445
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,260
or difficult times, there is hope,

446
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,460
and you can draw a lot of strength from your faith

447
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,940
and by your hard work.

448
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:23,940


449
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:23,940


450
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,860
Thank you.

451
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:25,860


452
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:25,860


453
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:25,860


454
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,120
And I do.

455
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,680
About a year ago, my place of employment was infiltrated by a picture-perfect definition of pink.

456
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,640
My place of employment became absolutely miserable.

457
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,120
I mean, being there, it was a real drag,

458
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,040
and this guy was on a mission to drive everyone there down,

459
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,680
and it was bad news.

460
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,480
And I reached a point where I wasn't sure if I was going to hang in there or not.

461
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,040
I'm talking about keeping my job.

462
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,940
I'm talking about keeping my job.

463
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,060
And I remembered a really, really swell book.

464
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,480
A lot of you have read it.

465
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,800
A lot of you really know it well.

466
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,440
Yes, sir!

467
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,980
Well, this is an interesting thing.

468
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,760
Number one on the back of my truck, my truck cab, I have a beware sticker.

469
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,060
Yes, sir.

470
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,740
And I take a lot of pride in that, and it's got a picture of Bob,

471
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,640
and I'm proud to have it there, and if people want to raise an eyebrow, it's all right by me.

472
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,500
I got my thing.

473
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,580
If you don't, tough luck, duck.

474
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:23,940
Thank you.

475
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,680
So on lunch breaks, I made it a practice to get out of the shop and get away from this guy,

476
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,060
get away from the negativity and the bad vibes.

477
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,940
And every lunch break, I would reread the book.

478
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,740
I've been through it, and I enjoy it.

479
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,640
It's meant a lot to me, and this became my routine to go out and reread.

480
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,280
I started from the beginning, and I was just working my way through,

481
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,100
and something really awesome happened.

482
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,260
About six months of putting up with this guy, maybe it was eight months, he was dismissed.

483
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,080
Yes, sir.

484
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,220
And life got better.

485
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,680
Yes.

486
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,460
So if you're down in the dumps and things are going bad, man, you got to hang on to your slack

487
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,440
and be proud you're a subgenius and draw strength and have faith because you can pull through, man,

488
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,400
and things can get better.

489
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,100
Yes, sir.

490
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,980
And so I'm here to testify.

491
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,080
Yes, sir.

492
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,400
I represent the quiet people, and I want you all to have a good night,

493
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,840
and I want you all to enjoy the next day, and that's it.

494
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,340
Thank you.

495
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,600
Amen.

496
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,380
We love you, Winona.

497
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,180
We love you, Winona.

498
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,000
Woo-hoo.

499
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,300
One more round of applause for Wilhelm, by the way.

500
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,480
Are you moving softly and carrying a big...

501
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,100
Yes, yes.

502
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,120
With the new Cream Rabbit, you can give someone an orgasm while standing up to 600 yards away.

503
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,200
If you have good aim.

504
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,120
Cream Rabbit, Cream Rabbit.

505
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,500
Load them fire.

506
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,640
Cream Rabbit, Cream Rabbit.

507
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,900
Cream Rabbit, load them fire.

508
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,620
Cream Rabbit, Cream Rabbit.

509
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,340
Cream Rabbit, load them fire.

510
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,540
Cream Rabbit, Cream Rabbit.

511
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,800
Cream Rabbit, load them fire.

512
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,060
guitar solo

513
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,320
guitar solo

514
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,560
guitar solo

515
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
guitar solo

516
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,660
guitar solo

517
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,420
guitar solo

518
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,480
guitar solo

519
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:17,980
guitar solo

520
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,640
Here you go, hi stupid, why'd you want to go get pinned?

521
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,940
Ah!

522
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,300
Ah!

523
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,840
Ah!

524
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:28,960
Ah!

525
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,000
Ah!

526
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,060
Ah!

527
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,160
Ah!

528
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,160


529
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:30,640


530
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,320
Ah!

531
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,360
Ah!

532
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,160
Ah!

533
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,160


534
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,660
Ah!

535
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:35,660


536
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,040
Ah!

537
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,560
Oh wait, look at this.

538
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,640
Last to start!

539
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,020
Last to start!

540
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,240
Last to start!

541
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,860
Last to start!

542
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,820
So I don't have anything prepared, um, I just have to say this is my seventh year here,

543
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:54,500
and I've finally gotten to the point where Ivan and Pisces have actually know my name,

544
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,920
because I hang in the background so much, and that's kind of my thing.

545
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,840
But, I know I enjoy everything.

546
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,060
So, I got to say thank you to this man.

547
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,880
to everybody who has given me slack

548
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,740
for the past seven years of me coming on

549
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,780
and showing up and not really giving anything back

550
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,840
to everybody. And I feel a little bit

551
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,960
bad about that, but you guys all rock

552
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
and this is the greatest party ever.

553
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,860
So I just had to come up and say that.

554
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,180
So yeah.

555
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,080
That's slack.

556
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,940
You guys all rock and I enjoy hanging out

557
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,800
with all of you and I can't see anybody up here

558
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,320
with all the fucking lights, but that's okay.

559
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,040
And I've come to say that. So thank you!

560
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,260
Thank you!

561
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
There's so much love.

562
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,700
It's like one great big cuddle.

563
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,180
Except it's a sweaty cuddle.

564
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
And one of you didn't bathe.

565
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,180
Thank you.

566
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,740
Everybody give Spike

567
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,880
another round of applause.

568
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,460
Real quick.

569
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,700
Great bullshit!

570
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,160
You're blockers!

571
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,960
Suds, it's bitch,

572
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,640
not witch. I can't fly this.

573
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,340
And Vice-Attach is right.

574
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,040
One of the things that you have to remember

575
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,000
is that

576
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,980
you can't go to

577
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,100
the giant machine

578
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,980
head on and just bang

579
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,340
on it with your fists.

580
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,460
On the other hand,

581
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,600
you can put superglue in the gears

582
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,700
when no one's looking

583
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
and let the machine destroy itself.

584
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,980
Suds Bishal was right.

585
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,060
We have a conspiracy to fight,

586
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,520
not each other.

587
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,740
Zealoth, Zeal Zealoth Hunter

588
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,260
slash Reverend Scapegoat.

589
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,460
He was right.

590
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,940
This is a cool party.

591
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm not going to lie.

592
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,420
And there's a lot of love

593
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,660
I'm hearing from guys like Spike.

594
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,940
Good Reverend Roger

595
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,880
is explaining to us

596
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,180
via the voice of Stang

597
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,120
the actual complications

598
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,000
of what we are up against.

599
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,140
But we're all here

600
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,940
despite all of the

601
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,160
setbacks and losses.

602
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
We are here

603
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
and despite

604
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,100
all of the ways

605
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,560
the conspiracy has attempted to stop us.

606
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,320
If there is nothing else you gain

607
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,600
from showing up to X-Day,

608
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,400
even if Bob screws us again,

609
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,440
even if the saucers don't come,

610
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,720
if you go home

611
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,700
realizing that you have allies

612
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,300
in the war against the Khan,

613
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,760
if that's all you gain,

614
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,300
you're going to be in trouble.

615
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,240
You've gained a lot.

616
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,060
And in a way that's slack too.

617
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,380
I'm going to do another call for ranters.

618
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,560
You can start wandering up here.

619
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,100
I can't see you by the way.

620
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,520
As every ranter said,

621
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,220
you guys are,

622
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,400
I can see the guys on the wall.

623
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,280
And I can see the sound booth.

624
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,820
And that's it.

625
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,480
Is there anyone else who would like to rant?

626
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,600
Because if you don't,

627
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,960
then I'm going to do a really horrible acapella song.

628
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,640
A cover of an Elton John song.

629
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,360
Are you guys serious?

630
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,540
You gotta do a jig with it.

631
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,580
They're all taking part in the sacred doctrine of raceability.

632
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,840
They want to be erased.

633
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,920
Eraseability?

634
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,440
I take total blame for this one.

635
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,440
So, I'm an Elton John fan,

636
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:00,960
which is probably...

637
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,860
I don't know if that's surprising or not.

638
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,120
So, I also have a problem with taking songs that are,

639
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,560
a little back story on this.

640
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,940
I have a,

641
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,380
and we've seen some of my horribles,

642
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,600
and I've posted them in groups.

643
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,260
I have this problem that if I get a song stuck in my head,

644
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,480
I can turn it into a Bob song almost instantly.

645
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,560
So, but I can't sing on the podium.

646
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,240
Hold on a second.

647
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,240
That's not a problem.

648
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,420
That's a fucking hell of a talent.

649
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah, I can't sing.

650
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,760
I can't sing with it on the podium.

651
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,180
Actually, if you put that one back, I can do the other one.

652
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,260
Oh, you're gonna live the other one?

653
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,040
Yeah, let's do that.

654
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,920
So, hold on just a second.

655
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,220
Are we live?

656
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,720
Oh, yeah.

657
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,520
So, the other day I woke up,

658
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,620
it was about two weeks ago,

659
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,920
I woke up, I was getting ready for work,

660
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,700
and Sud says,

661
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,740
and Bob lies bleeding from the head.

662
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,820
And I said,

663
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,180
give me three minutes.

664
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,940
And this is what I came up with.

665
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,840
The froth that's in his stash box,

666
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,940
it's gotten harsh and dry.

667
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,200
Everything about this guy feels like a fucking lie.

668
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,140
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day

669
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,520
that I gave my money to the big smiling face

670
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,100
and waited for X day.

671
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,300
And Bob lies bleeding from the head.

672
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,760
Oh, I killed him before he could fuck us all again.

673
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,280
Cause I met him on the road and asked him what he said,

674
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,100
but his smile was just too much and so I shot him dead.

675
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,680
And Bob lies bleeding from the head.

676
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,300
So I wonder if this bullet will leave a scar on your head.

677
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,300


678
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,320


679
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,500
But because your pipe still burns,

680
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm sure that we are through.

681
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,460
Cause you'll resurrect like every other time.

682
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,160
I know I'm happy now.

683
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,600
But if you were me,

684
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,920
you would've done the same, Bob.

685
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,580
You'd kill you anyhow.

686
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,360
Sing along.

687
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,600
And Bob lies bleeding from the head.

688
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,660
Oh, I killed him before he could fuck us all again

689
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, I met him on the road and asked him what he said

690
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,380
But his smile was just too much and so I shot him dead

691
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,120
And Bob Lyle's bleeding from the head

692
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,220
We talked about doing that, but Elton John is like an acquired taste

693
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,360
And I don't know many people who can play that on piano

694
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,780
I probably should have asked

695
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,900
So now that I've embarrassed myself

696
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,640
It was wonderful

697
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,220
I came

698
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Three times

699
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,320
I keep telling you I only have one wet neck

700
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,280
I mean, God

701
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,580
God

702
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,180
I might have some baby wipes or something, I don't know

703
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:37,540
I don't know

704
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:55,720
Sometimes he was on bass and drums

705
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,280
And sometimes Suds Peshaw was on guitar

706
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,580
Anyway, the song is Peabrake

707
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,940
To be followed by a flush

708
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,680
And then after that, the band Monkey Hive

709
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
Now with Suds and Pisces

710
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,060
Doing the song rant called

711
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,980
Hate, Subgenius Style

712
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,960
But first, Reverend Angry Larry with Peabrake

713
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,100
We'll overcome this

714
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,060
But if it isn't always good

715
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,840
And if it is, then there's a reason touched

716
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,560
Joe Cheevar

717
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:47,580
In 2006, vimos by Father Joe

718
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:47,580


719
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Over time at John Modena's Marines

720
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:48,580


721
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:55,580
At минимum speed

722
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,260
Thank you.

723
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,760
I really have to pee.

724
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm not kidding.

725
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,800
My bladder's getting big

726
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,960
from eating all the privy.

727
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,280
Whatever that means.

728
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,760
A lot of the booze

729
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,860
needs to come out.

730
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,660
A lot of the booze

731
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,500
needs to come out.

732
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
guitar solo

733
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,820
It's Devo, Devo

734
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,840
laying out there.

735
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,520
He's laying on the rocks.

736
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,540
He's got a boner.

737
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,040
He's got a boner.

738
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,220
He doesn't have much

739
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,140
hair.

740
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,040
But he's wearing tan shorts

741
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,140
like every angry Larry.

742
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,060
guitar solo

743
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,360
guitar solo

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


758
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


759
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


760
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


761
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820

guitar solo

769
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,760
Pisces just took a whiz behind the stage

770
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,540
She thought it was funny cause I just was talking about

771
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,060
Devo Devo and me

772
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,720
She's wearing a red blue shirt

773
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,680
I'm not color blind

774
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm eating a bite cause I can't tell if you can hear me

775
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,720
Can you hear me?

776
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,180
Okay, those guys over there can hear me

777
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,860
Oh, and two beats can hear me too

778
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
If I had blood I'd blush

779
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,520
Oh, and two beats can hear me too

780
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,700
If I had blood I'd blush

781
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,640
We're the dirt piles

782
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm not talking about a pile of dirt

783
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm talking about when you get piles from sitting on some frozen concrete

784
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,040
And your ass gets all fucked up

785
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,940
And then it was just sand shoved all over to try and make it better

786
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
We're real doctor music

787
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Not like those fucking

788
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,380
Other

789
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:49,520
Other

790
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,220
Alien fucks

791
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,200
Like alien amino fucks

792
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,080
Can't even show up

793
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,200
Don't fucking clap

794
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,320
No

795
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
You all

796
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
You all have to clap

797
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,660
You're such an asshole

798
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,900
Your girlfriend's an asshole too

799
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,980
Don't walk away yet

800
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,860
I'm not done

801
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,240
Hating you

802
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,400
I hate what's for dinner

803
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,040
I had hate for breakfast too

804
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,660
Hated my morning coffee

805
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,800
Hated bedtime too

806
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,320
Hated what comes natural

807
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,220
Hate for all the yetikins

808
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,780
Hate for the old

809
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,720
Hate we got plenty for you so

810
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,120
Hey, fuck you

811
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,600
Come again

812
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,120
You know something douchebag

813
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,140
I'm pretty tired of your spit

814
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,840
Things are changing

815
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,940
Right about now

816
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,300
Hello fan

817
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm pretty tired of your spit

818
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,260
Meat and shit

819
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,320
I can tell one thing

820
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,340
You're missing out

821
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,520
About wow wow

822
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,540
And I can tell you another thing

823
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,960
You're wasting my time right now

824
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,860
Oh Jesus fucking Christ

825
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,420
Are you still talking?

826
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
Bitch you yeast

827
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,860
You dried up cunt

828
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,900
An incarnation of rectal itch

829
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,940
Oh yeah motherfucker

830
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,780
Just cause you think

831
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,360
You're hot shit

832
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,860
Didn't help the fact

833
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,620
That you're a big dumb fuck

834
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,400
Whose lady ran off

835
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
With his best friend

836
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,560
He was smart enough

837
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,960
To pay his thirty five

838
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,720
You needle dicked

839
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,640
Incompetent fucktard

840
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,440
Let's go for a ride

841
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,560
You and your

842
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,680
Twat booger girlfriend

843
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,720
Can go back to

844
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,420
Padunkerville asshats all

845
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,740
Before I shove your head

846
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,240
Down your throat

847
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,720
And out your fucking ass

848
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,120
Asshole

849
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,940
I'm gonna count to three

850
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,880
So you better start running

851
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,120
Shit for brains

852
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,580
Pink ass motherfucker

853
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,800
Cause I'm about to unleash

854
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,880
The rage of a serious round

855
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
Of uber femme

856
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,480
On your candy ass

857
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,780
Hate you're such an asshole

858
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,840
Hate your girlfriend too

859
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,400
Hate don't walk away yet

860
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,040
Cause I'm not done hating you

861
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,260
Hate sweats for dinner

862
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,400
Hate for breakfast too

863
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,820
Hate my morning coffee

864
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,780
And some hate at bedtime too

865
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,320
Hate for breakfast too

866
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,320


867
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,320


868
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,180
adelmś Vielleicht!

869
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,980
Oh excuse me

870
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,280
Were ya talkin'?

871
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,360
Cause you sounded

872
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,360
Like a chicken squawkin'

873
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,420
Let's be honest, you're just a sheep

874
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,620
A conspiracy of play toy, blind and weak

875
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,860
Bow wow wow, the wolves are loose

876
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,800
Let me give you a little rope and you can make your own news

877
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,420
I have no pity for the pinks or their kind

878
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,900
Too bad this movie has got no rewind

879
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,880
Perhaps they'll regret the laughs and the taunts

880
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,740
The false sense of security they so love to flaunt

881
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,960
I've got no pity, nor any remorse

882
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,180
They get what they deserve, the plot has run its course

883
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,960
They took from my brother

884
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,400
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

885
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,400


886
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,140
I'm a man of pure yeti blood

887
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,320
And they stole from our sisters who share Connie's love

888
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,280
They don't deserve any less than they get

889
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,440
They choose the path and now the pinks will die by it

890
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,540
So brothers and sisters, my partners in slack

891
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,640
Raise the glass while the earth's turned black

892
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
We lost many battles, we lost many lives

893
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,400


894
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,760
We lost many battles, but we won the war

895
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,100
There's no turning back, no unlocking the door

896
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,880
Enjoy this vengeance so saccharine and sweet

897
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,400
Inhale deeply the smell of burnt pink meat

898
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,440
Those who fucked you, now they are undone

899
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,920
The journey of eternal pleasures for us has begun

900
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,400
To take you home, to take you home

901
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,400


902
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,400


903
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,400


904
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,400


905
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,400


906
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,160
Need them pills for Bobbin, did you write?

907
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,700
Look out the windows and bid the earth goodnight

908
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,380
Relax and lean back and smile with Bob's grin

909
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,520
Cause tonight, my brethren, the real fun begins

910
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,400
Oh, yeah, I feel like I'm in heaven

911
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,880
I feel like I'm in heaven

912
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,360
I feel like I'm in heaven

913
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,820
I feel like I'm in heaven

914
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,160
Oh, yes, yes, yes, friends

915
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,940
Hate subgenius style by Monkey Hive

916
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,940
Next we'll cut to the Starwood Festival

917
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,780
Actually the one from 2013, not this last one

918
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,840
With some business wherein I, Reverend Stang

919
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,800
Read some salacious details about where little subgeniuses come from

920
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,740
That was all originally written by Nenslow

921
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,100
Did I remember to say

922
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,800
Wake up, sleep, and die?

923
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:13,800


924
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:13,800


925
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,080
Sleeple?

926
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Yes, I did

927
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,860
Princess Wee coined that term, sleeple

928
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,840
I was bitching like I do every three days

929
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,420
About people who call everybody else sheeple

930
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:34,820
I must see 50 times a day in the internet flame war columns

931
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,980
And at the bottom of all the news articles

932
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,260
Wake up, sheeple

933
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,740
God, can't they think of something more original?

934
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,180
It's off like

935
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,520
Wake up, sheeple

936
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,320
You're all the same, sheeple

937
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,380
And they're all saying that

938
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,400
The first time I heard that used as an insult, sheeple

939
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,600
I think it was Chaz Smith's radio show in the early 90s

940
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,020
And I thought it was pretty clever the first time I heard it

941
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,500
25 years later and all the sheeple are calling each other sheeple

942
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,580
Gee

943
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,960
That's a great advancement

944
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,860
Okay

945
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,740
What, what

946
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh

947
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,060
We did the early days of natural philosophy

948
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,140
That's what they called science

949
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,360
Before they thought of the word science

950
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,700
We covered

951
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,540
Oh, we didn't cover where little subgeniuses come from

952
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,120
And this will be just perfect

953
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,120
I may have done this one last year under the title

954
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,600
Why sex feels good and pain hurts

955
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,560
It's sad that we have to accept that

956
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,140
But it explains stuff like that, isn't it?

957
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,980
Now if you don't believe these, some of these creatures

958
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,740
Some people think they're mythical

959
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,380
But if you go up to Caffeina's

960
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,080
You'll see that they sell maps of wisteria

961
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,300
That show where you can find these very species of animals

962
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,020
But this is where little subgeniuses come from

963
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,880
Now if y'all aren't married yet

964
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,540
You better know that you're not married yet

965
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,540


966
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,540


967
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,480
You better not try this

968
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,900
Now wasn't there somebody here who needed to get married

969
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,560
They wanted to try it, so they needed to get married

970
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,200
Right, Reverend Anacron and

971
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,260
Marie

972
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,080
I'll just, anyway

973
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,820
If there's anyone here who objects to the binding of these two

974
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,400
In wedded bliss

975
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,760
I don't want to hear about it

976
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,380
Go away

977
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,840
Just shut up

978
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,420
I'm a holy man and you're married now

979
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,840
Now shake on it and say

980
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,520
It's a holy man

981
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:43,820
It's a deal

982
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,620
I do

983
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,520
This is a 24-hour marriage

984
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,380
Luckily, this is a short-duration marriage

985
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,320
You know, Bob is a short-duration personal savior

986
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,680
We do everything

987
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,460
Keeping in mind the built-in obsolescence

988
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,240
So anyway, for the next 24 hours

989
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,060
You will still be without sin when you do this stuff

990
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,820
To make little baby subgeniuses

991
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,440
When I

992
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,500
Are they still alive?

993
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,400
Are there any children here?

994
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,100
I guess I really do need to explain where little baby subgeniuses come from

995
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,960
Okay, I'll use the

996
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,600
I won't be able to play this one on the radio

997
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,500
When a face-fucking bat attacks a male yeti subgenius

998
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,960
And ejaculates its poisoned sperm down his throat

999
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,520
And the yeti is not promptly treated with face-fucking-bat-sperm-antidote pudding

1000
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,220
It must find a prairie squid to fuck

1001
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,480
Or it will die

1002
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,260
When a bat-sperm-infected yeti male fucks a prairie squid

1003
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,260
The prairie squid empties him out like a man-shaped condom

1004
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,300
Leaving only the undamaged skin lying on a heap upon the ground

1005
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,760
The prairie squid stores and mutates the yeti sperm

1006
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,280
And ejaculates it into a female yeti on not-infrequent occasions

1007
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,820
The prairie squid-mutated yeti sperm

1008
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,200
Swims up the tube and gets into the yeti's body

1009
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:20,040
And impregnates the female's entire lifetime supply of eggs all at once

1010
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,600
Transforming her into a vast egg bag with a little human torso on one end

1011
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:32,040
The thousands of prairie squid-mutated yeti sperm-impregnated yeti eggs

1012
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,640
Hatch out into thousands of face-fucking-bats

1013
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,120
Who seek yeti to face-rape, etc.

1014
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,320
This isn't about where baby subgeniuses come from

1015
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,240
This is about where face-fucking-bats come from

1016
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,100
God, no wonder there aren't more baby subgeniuses

1017
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,640
And there's so damn many face-fucking-bats

1018
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,600
Oh, one hint, friends

1019
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,180
If you stand on the hilltop up there waiting for those bats

1020
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,340
With your antidote pudding

1021
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,140
Do us a favor and make sure that antidote pudding is in a plastic jar

1022
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,200
So that you don't get a heart attack from it

1023
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,200


1024
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,200


1025
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,040
So that you don't, like, drop it and break it

1026
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,840
When the bat wraps itself around your face and starts doing, you know

1027
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:29,980
Yes, I'm leaving myself time for one last rant at the end

1028
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,220
But I wanted to do, like, a Q&A

1029
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,300
Those are always fun

1030
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,060
But I am losing my hearing

1031
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,960
And I'm going to buy a Wii U before I buy a hearing aid

1032
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,160
So if you're going to ask me a question

1033
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,000
You're going to have to come right up here and yell it in my face

1034
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,340
Reverend Ben, you can yell real loud

1035
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,100
What did I get myself into?

1036
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,100
What did I get myself into?

1037
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,860
Asks the newly ordained subgenius

1038
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,160
Wouldn't you like to have to ask yourself that question, friends?

1039
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,700
I know you would

1040
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,680
Hadn't the best times of your life

1041
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,620
Were when you woke up the next day going

1042
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,620
What have I gotten myself into?

1043
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,140
And the next thing you know, ten months later

1044
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,840
There's a bunch of little baby subgeniuses running around

1045
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,900
Go figure

1046
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,640
Anybody else have a question?

1047
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,580
Mervin

1048
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,000
I have to translate

1049
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,940
Why are you?

1050
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,800
Why are you?

1051
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,400
Why are you?

1052
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,200
That would speak...

1053
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,580
Spell...

1054
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,260
You-ruh

1055
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,820
Right?

1056
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,800
Why are you?

1057
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,660
You-ruh

1058
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,240
Or I suppose it could be pronounced

1059
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,300
I-ruh

1060
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,180
I-ruh

1061
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:58,460
I am just another robot

1062
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,520
Like everybody else

1063
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,900
But I'm the robot that's been programmed

1064
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,400
To tell everybody that they're a bunch of robots

1065
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,500
But they're programmed to pay very little attention to that

1066
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,980
And I don't blame them

1067
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,960
Because what are we going to do about it?

1068
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,520
Anyway

1069
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,220
Being robots

1070
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,580
Oh, I got up this morning

1071
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,800
Or actually just before we came down here

1072
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,040
To set up the sales table over there

1073
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:34,280
I looked at the internet news to see if that horrible battle between the humans had been decided

1074
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,160
The Zimmerman trial

1075
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,460
Um

1076
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,060
And it hadn't been

1077
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,200
But I noticed that...

1078
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,200


1079
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,080
that the Texas legislature had gotten back together

1080
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,380
and gone ahead and passed that bill

1081
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,940
that's a disguised anti-abortion bill,

1082
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,800
and poor state senator Wendy Davis,

1083
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,360
the new subgenius saint,

1084
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,400
had to sit there and watch it happen.

1085
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,300
I don't know if everybody here knows

1086
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,640
about what happened in Texas.

1087
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,760
This lady, Senator Wendy Davis,

1088
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,600
did a 13-hour filibuster

1089
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,760
to prevent this abortion bill from going through,

1090
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,680
which she did.

1091
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,080
Actually, the Republicans found a way

1092
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,300
to disqualify her about half an hour

1093
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,700
before the deadline was up,

1094
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,320
but the civilian witnesses in the building

1095
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,620
chanted shame, shame, shame

1096
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,820
at the Republicans so loud

1097
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,640
that it obstructed the thing.

1098
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,120
The Republicans did what they wanted to do anyway.

1099
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,480
I'm not going to tell,

1100
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:42,920
I'm not going to tell anybody

1101
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,340
what's the good guys and what's the bad guys

1102
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,140
because I really don't understand

1103
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,300
how the world should be run all that great myself.

1104
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,720
But I do know that,

1105
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,160
okay, I've been standing here for almost an hour.

1106
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,720
She had to do that for 13 hours without peeing.

1107
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,880
Now, I've got this little jar here.

1108
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,260
I've been able to pee six times while I was standing here.

1109
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
You couldn't even tell, could you?

1110
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,380
Well, she didn't have a pulpit.

1111
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,080
In fact, they brought her a back brace

1112
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,840
to help her stand up because, you know, it hurts.

1113
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,600
And they disqualified that.

1114
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,660
So you notice I'm not in a huge hurry

1115
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,960
to move back to Texas.

1116
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,580
But I wouldn't be surprised if in about four years

1117
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,360
they're calling her Governor Wendy Davis

1118
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,840
and then I might move back at least during the winter.

1119
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,840
Great job.

1120
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,060
Great job.

1121
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,620
And so, since I didn't get any more Q's and A's,

1122
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,960
now don't be shy.

1123
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,360
But by the way, you know, if anybody wants to like

1124
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,420
have a conversation with Princess Wee herself

1125
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,000
or Reverend Stang himself, we're fairly approachable,

1126
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,040
especially if you talk to us at the sales table.

1127
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,020
But we'll be around for the rest of Starwood for sure.

1128
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,360
And we're always down at the bonfire.

1129
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,200
They used to have Princess Wee and me

1130
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,540
lead the bonfire lighting parade.

1131
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,160
They did that two years in a row,

1132
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,660
but they learned their lesson.

1133
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,720
Don't put a subgenius in the front

1134
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,340
because they will lose their way

1135
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,440
and just kind of meander off to wherever the nearest

1136
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,740
smell of dead skunk is.

1137
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,220
I don't know why that is.

1138
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,540
They always seem to go that way.

1139
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,020
Friends, you're listening to an extra long hour

1140
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,160
or more of Slack, internet only.

1141
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,560
We'll be back with more of the latest news

1142
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:45,600
from the radio station.

1143
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,480
And we'll close with this poignant rant

1144
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,300
from Reverend Frodis Suds Pasha,

1145
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,340
which you can also see him deliver more forcefully

1146
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,940
on YouTube.

1147
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,500
But in this case, at 17X Day,

1148
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,280
which is more of a laid back situation this time,

1149
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,860
it was delivered somewhat more gently,

1150
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,140
considering the subject matter.

1151
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,680
The next ranter is Suds Pasha.

1152
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,580
Hi, I'm Suds Pasha.

1153
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,580


1154
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,580


1155
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,580


1156
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,580


1157
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,420
Is this gonna be a vomiting performance?

1158
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,900
Unfortunately, no.

1159
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,660
What's in the bucket, man?

1160
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,600
Give me a second.

1161
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,520
I wasn't quite prepared to do this tonight.

1162
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,640
Oh, but I had this great rant coming in here.

1163
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,860
It's all full of fire and brimstone

1164
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:47,460
and all the nice, nah, but I don't know if I want to do that.

1165
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,360
No, seriously, it's like,

1166
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,620
everything that's happened over the last couple of days,

1167
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,940
it just doesn't feel right.

1168
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,880
There's a lot of shit.

1169
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,720
Yeah, there's a lot of praising Bob going on here,

1170
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,920
and I don't think it was appropriate.

1171
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,680
Everybody treat this man like shit for the next 24 hours.

1172
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,180
However, I do still have what I was going to say.

1173
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,900
I just may say it a little differently.

1174
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,840
That's fine, son.

1175
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:29,260
I mean, we come here having survived our baptism of conspiracy fire.

1176
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,900
We face down the scorching winds of pink,

1177
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,000
sandblasted by the harsh reality of the conspiracy.

1178
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,660
We've stood strong against it.

1179
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,580
We've faced the blazing inferno of the conspiracy.

1180
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,860
I, myself, have watched loved ones punch their final ticket,

1181
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,800
getting themselves an early window seat on those escape vessels.

1182
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,720
And I know that many members of Bob's brood

1183
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,780
have gone through their own specific trials and tribulations

1184
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,660
to be here at our most sacred ground.

1185
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,620
How you doing, Teeter?

1186
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,220
How's that foot, man?

1187
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,320
It is lovely.

1188
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,380
Bob gave that to me, and I'm enjoying it.

1189
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,560
Thank you.

1190
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,220
Bob gave an excuse.

1191
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,200
I mean, each of us wear the scars from a long battle

1192
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,500
against the oppressive machine of pink dominion.

1193
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,960
And each of us comes here today with a soul full of slack

1194
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,840
and stupid grin as proof of the power of divine's teachings.

1195
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,700
So I have to ask this gaggle of retards one simple question.

1196
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,140
Why?

1197
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:39,000
With all this reservoir of slack and collective creativity at our disposal,

1198
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,260
why must we continually turn our Dobbs-given hate and derision upon each other?

1199
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,620
It appears that the old conspiracy wiring continues to affect many of us.

1200
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,960
It seems that the conspiracy indoctrination we struggle against continues to influence us.

1201
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,720
But here, here what I've seen the last couple of days,

1202
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,300
it's like, I don't see it.

1203
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,020
So, I see nothing but slack going on here.

1204
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:16,280
And it's, everybody outside these walls, man, they're going through their own shit.

1205
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:22,980
But, my God, we had such a hard time getting here this year, many of us.

1206
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,100
But we're here.

1207
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,180
We found a way to do this.

1208
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,120
So why didn't they come?

1209
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,600
Why didn't they come here and experience this with us?

1210
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,700
I mean,

1211
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,140
does it mean their slack is more important than everyone else's?

1212
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,540
I mean, that joke may be funny as fuck, but they're the only one laughing.

1213
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:57,200
I, you know, maybe they think that they're better than Bob, but I got some bad news for you, sunshine.

1214
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:05,340
No one is better than Bob, because it's Bob who reminded you that you had slack.

1215
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,460
The Church of the Subgenius!

1216
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:17,320
It's, it's, it's, it's the last place to be if you're the, it's the last place to be if you're one of the

1217
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:25,720
cliques of circle jerks and, you know, who think they can pick the chosen few who come into this thing.

1218
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,220
All it takes is 35 bucks.

1219
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,500
That's really all it takes.

1220
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,020
I mean,

1221
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,720
they think it's some sort of clique, like it's some sort of cool kids clubhouse that,

1222
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:38,900
you know, hey,

1223
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,880
you can come and knock on the door, secret handshake.

1224
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,520
Nah,

1225
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,420
because let me tell you something.

1226
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:54,780
Me, you guys, me especially, we were not, nor were we ever, nor will we ever be,

1227
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,400
one of the cool kids.

1228
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,720
Because we are subgeniuses.

1229
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,540
We are the outcasts among outcasts,

1230
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,000
destined to eat by our

1231
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,500
goddamn selves in the cafeteria of life.

1232
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,640
But you know what?

1233
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,620
Everybody here,

1234
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,400
we're all eating at the same table.

1235
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:17,080
Yeah!

1236
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:18,800
Scrapple!

1237
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:28,400
You can usually tell when natural selections, it works when they found they're the only ones laughing at the joke.

1238
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,960
And, and, and, you know, maybe we're a bunch of bullies or something, you know,

1239
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,260
trying to get you to,

1240
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,520
I don't want to be here anymore.

1241
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,420
I'm sorry.

1242
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,060
That, you're just not worth that much effort.

1243
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,840
There's too much slack to be had.

1244
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,200
I'd rather put my effort towards that.

1245
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,240
So, I mean, maybe they've convinced themselves we're the problem.

1246
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,440
We're out here having a good time.

1247
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,040
Fuck this.

1248
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,400
I'm stuck at home with all my problems.

1249
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,500
I can't be out here.

1250
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,380
Sorry, fuck-up.

1251
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,740
We, we came here because, damn it, Bob,

1252
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,540
told us to.

1253
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,620
No excuses!

1254
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,940
There is no excuse.

1255
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,660
Well, there is an excuse, but

1256
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,980
it's really only good for Bob.

1257
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,120
You know?

1258
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:24,740
You see, they, they, they, they think that joke is so funny and they've hidden behind that term,

1259
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,300
fuck them if they can't pick a joke.

1260
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,760
A lot of them have really rehearsed that line to the point where it's, it's, it's reflexive.

1261
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,980
But here's the thing about comedy.

1262
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,540
If you have to tell somebody that it's a joke,

1263
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,820
it's not funny.

1264
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,520
But, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1265
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,020
That's really more of a guideline than a rule.

1266
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,420
Because there's only one rule.

1267
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,680
Only one that demands to be followed in this church.

1268
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,340
Only one that demands adherence, and that is the subjugious must-have slide!

1269
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:03,820
Yeah!

1270
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:04,940
Yeah!

1271
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:05,680
Yeah!

1272
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,440
Yeah!

1273
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,640
Yeah!

1274
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,500
Yeah!

1275
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:08,980
Yeah!

1276
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:09,680
Yeah!

1277
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,540
Yes, sir!

1278
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,500
The Church of the Subgenius is here to show you the steps of sacrament to slack.

1279
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,360
Do you know them?

1280
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,380
They've been told to you more often than I can think of.

1281
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,660
Step number one, get off your ass.

1282
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,720
We did that.

1283
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,560
We're here!

1284
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,200
Yes, sir!

1285
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,800
Yes, sir!

1286
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,580
Rule number two, bust your ass!

1287
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,320
Hey, look, we got the fucking lights working!

1288
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,460
We got sound!

1289
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,400
Woo!

1290
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,440
Woo!

1291
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,280
Woo!

1292
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,420
Three, get others to bust their ass for you.

1293
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,540
Hey, you motherfucking monkeys out there who've been helping us through this, praise you,

1294
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:47,920
motherfuckers, seriously.

1295
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:48,540
Yeah!

1296
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,120
Yeah!

1297
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:49,360
Yeah!

1298
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:49,800
Yeah!

1299
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:49,960
Yeah!

1300
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:50,300


1301
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:50,420


1302
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:50,620
Yeah!

1303
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,200


1304
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,200


1305
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,740
Yeah!

1306
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:51,800


1307
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,820
Yeah!

1308
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,140
Yeah!

1309
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:53,820
Yeah!

1310
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,440
Yeah!

1311
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,440


1312
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,440


1313
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,440


1314
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,880
What the perfect system.

1315
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,100
You're still sitting here?

1316
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,480
You're classy now.

1317
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,540
Ha ha ha.

1318
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,000
Oh my God.

1319
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,020
Listen, say, are you free today, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

1320
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,020


1321
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,020


1322
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,020


1323
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,020


1324
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,340
All along.

1325
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:19,240
No big deal.

1326
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:19,240


1327
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:19,540
Okay,태ué?

1328
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,200
Hey, you're free again tomorrow?

1329
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,720
slack that slacks mine because you see if you have to go out of your way to

1330
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,140
steal the slack from your fellow mutants in order to fortify your own you

1331
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:40,220
committed they Cardinal sin in this church the inside joke a sin so horrific

1332
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:47,580
you can get your name X out of the book of life I've seen it if you've used some

1333
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,020
of these people as fucking target practice on Facebook you know I'm talking

1334
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,600
about right and car you know exactly who I'm talking about mr. sister you

1335
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,340
know who exactly who I'm talking about

1336
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:07,980
but the all-inclusive excuse it only works for Bob because honestly when you

1337
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:14,100
stand on your pillar of contribution of art music and sermons and think you can

1338
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:21,560
piss on everybody that's below you I'm sorry there's only one person in this

1339
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,000
church that's going to come to church and say that's what I want you to do and

1340
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,900
that's sacrosanct, and that's Philodromon.

1341
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,860
Well, and maybe I haven't

1342
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,800
staying, but I don't think he's got the phone call yet.

1343
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,820
But I mean, just stop and look

1344
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,880
around you. Everybody that's out

1345
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,780
here, I can't see shit, all I see is a couple of

1346
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,740
blinking lights. Everybody out there,

1347
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,640
look at each other.

1348
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,720
You're under no obligation to

1349
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,260
like any of these people.

1350
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,680
There's no doctrine that says you have to

1351
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,080
agree with any of these people.

1352
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,720
In fact, some doctrine

1353
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,520
even says you're encouraged to hate them.

1354
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,680
There is nothing that says

1355
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,100
any of these subgenie

1356
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,500
should or would be your friend.

1357
01:05:59,060 --> 01:05:59,760
But

1358
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,780
for Dob's sake,

1359
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,620
they are your allies.

1360
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,880
They are your brothers

1361
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,560
in arms against the collective

1362
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,320
might of the conspiracy

1363
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,920
and their agents.

1364
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,720
None of us in our right mind

1365
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,560
could ever hope to actually hurt

1366
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,180
or stop the conspiracy,

1367
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,580
but this group of idiosyncratic

1368
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,300
abnormals has the power

1369
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,300
to make the agents of the conspiracy,

1370
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,540
those pink pricks that

1371
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,600
gleefully robbed the true subgenius

1372
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,440
of their slack for fun and profit.

1373
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,300
We have the power

1374
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,780
to make them regret

1375
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,620
they ever heard the name

1376
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs!

1377
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,740
But nope.

1378
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,720
They still are content

1379
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,180
to fling their feces at each other.

1380
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,500
And I'm proud of this.

1381
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,500
I'm proud of this.

1382
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,120
I'm proud of the fecal mess

1383
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,020
they contribute to.

1384
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,400
And while they're laughing

1385
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,480
and sniffing their finger,

1386
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,060
the pinks continue to get away with murder.

1387
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,400
All right.

1388
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,540
You've paid your money to Bob.

1389
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,080
You've got your membership card.

1390
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,820
You've hung the clipart on the wall

1391
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,360
of all inclusive excuse.

1392
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,000
You've done all that.

1393
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:20,900
You come to X-State.

1394
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,020
You're hoping for that big fucking saucer

1395
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:24,980
to come out of the sky

1396
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:25,900
and wish you to paradise.

1397
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,920
But maybe, just maybe,

1398
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,160
maybe they've been so busy

1399
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,560
sticking a poop-cake finger

1400
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,220
in the eyes of their brethren

1401
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,560
that they've overlooked

1402
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,120
or simply flat out ignored

1403
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,720
a few simple details.

1404
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,180
Because you see,

1405
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,600
once you take and put down

1406
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,720
the book of the subgenius,

1407
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,780
once you've taken the clipart off the wall,

1408
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,460
once you've destroyed the art,

1409
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,800
once you get rid of the propaganda,

1410
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,280
once you take off the mask,

1411
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,880
once you get beyond the joke of the mass,

1412
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:20,880


1413
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,920
once you get rid of the church of the subgenius,

1414
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,620
you end up with one glaringly obvious fact, folks.

1415
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,340
The fact that I have to spell it out for you today,

1416
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,100
since it's been spelled out to you

1417
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,840
for over 35 goddamn years,

1418
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,040
it shows how little some folks

1419
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,080
have actually been paying attention.

1420
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,580
This is Bob's party!

1421
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:45,360
And you and me

1422
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,700
were nothing but a guest

1423
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,320
who paid an admission fee.

1424
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,040
Yes, sir!

1425
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,740
If you think that Grant's permission

1426
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,920
to kick over furniture and shit in the Kool-Aid,

1427
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,700
well, let's just say

1428
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,820
I'm not gonna be the one drinking from the punch bowl.

1429
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,060
But I guess you got your membership card, right?

1430
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,640
I guess for some of these people,

1431
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,660
you just have to say,

1432
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,100
well, Ivan Stang said it best,

1433
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,480
some people are just too stupid,

1434
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,880
even for subgeniuses.

1435
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,860
I guess they just need to pay a little bit more.

1436
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,440
Get a little closer attention.

1437
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,800
Praise Bob.

1438
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,460
Happy X-Day, everybody.

1439
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,240
Whoa!

1440
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:37,400
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1441
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:37,840
Woo!

1442
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,260
Yeah!

1443
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,340
Yoo-hoo!

1444
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,060
Yeah!

1445
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:49,320
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1446
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,860
You've been listening to

1447
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:56,420
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
