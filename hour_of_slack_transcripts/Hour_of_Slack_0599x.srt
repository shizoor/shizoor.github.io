1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
A glam buff rip-off, one of those Entertainment Weekly jobbies that they sent us the little script to do and we get our 69.50 per hit.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,140
No one ever believes when we do this show on the moon. They always think it's done in Arizona somewhere.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,280
Sedona, they think. At the crystal transmitter.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:26,220
If they really knew what was really going on and the stuff that we say about the U.S. gobernanco and how much trouble we could really get into because

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:37,980
we're actually, if they knew where this show came from, where it really emanated from, that it was not really a live show and it was coming all the way from six feet, er, six miles, six miles under.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,480
Six feet under.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,260
Gosh.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,860
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,900
Subgenius.

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,120
Six miles under, dear friends.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:15,460
But enough of that buzzing in there here. If we go to DEFCON 7, that news bill alert not only the homophobic leprechaun people, which they're putting in every town across the country now.

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:24,560
There's another one of those absurd buffoon ideas that comes out of the D.I.A. and Reichsmarschall Otz left potato.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,100
You know, and these.

14
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,920
Guys go right.

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
Right along with it.

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Next thing you know, we've got these these strange creatures walking in and out of finest rainies and so forth.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,860
Excuse me for using these names on the air, you know, but in the supermarket, right?

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,960
You're in the supermarket and there they are from another what dimension who even knows where the hell they come from.

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,820
And we have to deal with it in some way or another.

20
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,100
We shut our eyes, you know, like maybe one eye goes a little bit askew or perhaps maybe even one eye points.

21
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,360
It's way the hell down at you, like, say, your left index toe or whatever you want to call it.

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,320
Your your right eye shoots all the way out there and is trying to mess around with Pegasaurus or whatever the hell the name is.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,220
You know, the sickness or something like that.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:19,100
So, you know, obviously you look like a criminal when you come up to a security guard and say, what's with the weird, you know, nuclear leprechaun, you know, the radioactive leprechaun in the store.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
And, you know, you get not not only do you not get a response from this.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,540
This Android security guard.

27
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:39,880
Furthermore, escorted out into the parking lot where like a couple of large Teutonic tit willow looking women come up and frisk you up and down until your legs are pink.

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,340
You know, despite the natural, natural yellow.

29
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,140
Dave's right about all that.

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,120
Actually, the replicants these days are not getting any better.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,320
They're they're not they're not making them right wherever they're.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,820
Making them.

33
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,880
I saw one that looked just like an old man shuffling down the street just today.

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,140
All typical.

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,460
Later 20th century American replicant character, you know, little poor thing could barely.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,740
I mean, it's just a machine, but it could barely shuffle along.

37
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,020
It's a little video cameras didn't work very well.

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,420
Obviously, it was having trouble keeping its balance.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,760
It was carrying somebody's groceries home for him.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,700
Oh, dear friends.

41
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,340
That was some lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz from Einstein Secret Orchestra recorded off the Internet.

42
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,720
WCSB's streaming and friends, friends, friends.

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,040
Tonight is the Austin revival night of tapes.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:53,940
We we did get some great audio recordings from the that the subgenius revival in Austin, Texas, a couple of weeks ago.

45
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,020
Sponsored by mighty fringe wear, praise fringe wear.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,040
And so that's what it's going to be tonight.

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,640
Folks, tapes of the preaching and the music here in the background.

48
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,580
You hear Booger 9000 with members of the Swingin' Love Corpses and Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz project.

49
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,020
Friends, we have the evil irreverent Friday Jones.

50
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,280
We have Cracklin.

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,240
Rosie.

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,040
Herself as performed by Booger 9000.

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,080
We've got my new rant about the well, the war, the new war.

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,380
The juggler speaks.

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,700
Pope Angus speaks.

56
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,020
Dr. Legume will preach.

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,760
Your ears off.

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,600
Booger 9000 will shock the living gee out of you.

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,940
Reverend Ed Strange.

60
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Hopefully, we'll get to Tom X.

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,620
The Crystal Methodist live prank calls done off stage.

62
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,580
On stage at the Austin Revival.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,620
And last but not least, Reverend Nikki Death Chick with her spanking.

64
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:23,020
But in the meantime, friends, let us go back into that selfsame Austin Revival just so many scant short few weeks ago.

65
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,500
Uh.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,560
Aah yesss.

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,120
Uh Yu.

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,940
mandolin and beingquestoniindo r심ной

69
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


70
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,940


71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:49,880
Normally if I were doing some Genius 101 to introduce the unsaved and so forth to the church,

72
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,440
We'd probably have.

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, we do have videos right here?

74
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,980
But we have the other subgenius cheerleaders and all this other stuff.

75
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,620
And I have my rehearsed rant and so forth.

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,660
But friends, tonight I don't care about the unsaved.

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,020
I don't care about those who never sent their $30 to Bob.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm preaching to the dudes playing subgeniuses.

79
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,140
Yes, this time I'm preaching to the choir.

80
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,000
Normally we do it the other way around.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,260
We're not like those other churches that only preach to the choir.

82
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,680
We like to go right down into the dams of iniquity like this club.

83
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,580
Where they sell drugs like beer and liquor and stuff.

84
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,820
And it's not a bad job actually.

85
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,960
Friends, one thing I should get clear and many people have asked about and wondered about.

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Most of us involved in the higher end of the church of the subgenius

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,980
are what are called subgeniuses.

88
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:50,980


89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,420
They're commonly called bisexuals.

90
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,560
That means when you buy, we come.

91
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,640
So, friends, Reverend Friday Jones and Irreverent Friday Jones

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,680
came all the way here from Boston just to sell you the sacred swag of that man Bob.

93
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,420
Praise Reverend Friday Jones.

94
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,000
She is the two large red globes standing beneath that.

95
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,820
Thank you.

96
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,100
Subgenius sinners.

97
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,840
Avert your eyes from the face of Bob because the smoke that rises from his pipe brings madness.

98
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,640
The light that shines from his grin induces blindness.

99
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,740
Merely to touch his filthy salesman hand is enough to make you grow hair on your palms.

100
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,680
His is the face that burns above the gates of hell.

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,120
His followers may laugh and dance in the maw of the apocalypse.

102
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,980
But those who are of pure heart can see.

103
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,280
That they are soulless slackers.

104
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,400
Heaven is not for such as those who went by their way onto the endless orgies of the pleasure saucers

105
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
to copulate with squamous alien things.

106
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,280
These sinners must be cast out of every home and left to wander nameless in the ashes

107
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,340
and then hunted down and purified.

108
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,980
You must help us save the subgeni.

109
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,220
Subgeni.

110
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,400
Send.

111
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,940
One dollar.

112
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,500
Two.

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Ban.

114
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,240
Organize.

115
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Blasphemy.

116
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,500
B.

117
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,660
O.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,560
B.

119
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,160
P.O.

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,700
Box.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,320
One.

122
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,800
Four.

123
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,340
O.

124
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,200
Three.

125
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,640
O.

126
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,160
Six.

127
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
Dallas, Texas.

128
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,600
Seven.

129
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,100
Five.

130
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,780
Two.

131
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,240
One.

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,580
Four.

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,620
A murmur of faith from the heart of the Bible Belt.

134
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,740
And friends,

135
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,780
those sacred,

136
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,460
and things will be going fast.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,480
And then I will be coming fast, I suppose you could say.

138
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,380
Um,

139
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,540
Pope Angus said one thing wrong.

140
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,940
He said that I was the leader of the church of the subgenius.

141
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,260
I just work here.

142
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,680
That man, Bob, is the only one whose instructions you should always follow.

143
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,980
In other words,

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,740
what we're trying,

145
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,600
I tell you friends,

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,500
is question authority or else.

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:25,920
Oh!

148
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,560
And that's when you're supposed to say,

149
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,140
why?

150
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,840
Why?

151
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Um,

152
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,040
friends,

153
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,380
there have,

154
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:36,800
uh,

155
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,440
we do have a schedule here,

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,120
believe it or not,

157
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,620
and we do stick to it.

158
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,020
Destroy it!

159
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh, do it!

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,260
Tell them about what?

161
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,780
How did you know a hair coat?

162
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Um,

163
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,200
friends,

164
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,760
there's been a lot of other Texas cult leaders,

165
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,260
in the news since the last time I was down here in Austin,

166
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,740
and,

167
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,700
you know,

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,140
when we look what happened to them,

169
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,340
I have to wonder whether we should even be here,

170
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,220
but, you know,

171
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,080
maybe, I don't know,

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,800
it's for the best.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,680
Well, as far as doomsday cults go,

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,860
friends, Texas doomsday cults,

175
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,680
we are certainly the most slackful.

176
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,660
I mean, I just,

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,240
it's, compared to the Heaven's Gate people,

178
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,660
uh,

179
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,940
you know,

180
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,300
and, and so forth,

181
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,520
I mean,

182
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,740
the way Dr. LeGuy and people,

183
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,000
as you put it,

184
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,440
the,

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,420
well, the Heaven's Gate people have some things right,

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,280
but we subgeniuses are perfectly happy to stand on the corner

187
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,800
and wait for the bus,

188
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,320
not leap out in front of the bus and say,

189
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,160
hit me, you know?

190
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,320
That's, um,

191
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,760
Just picture yourself.

192
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,420
And,

193
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,840
and,

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,600
it, what,

195
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,700
but to tell the truth,

196
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,720
what really pissed me off about the Heaven's Gate thing,

197
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,840
that's old news and so forth,

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,260
the, the sort of like Waco, I guess you could say,

199
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:47,560
but,

200
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,540
um,

201
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,420
you know,

202
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,840
as,

203
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,520
sure,

204
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,300
they were a bunch of dumbasses that got the date for the end of the world wrong

205
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,400
and left a couple of letters off the end of Bob's name every time I tried to say it,

206
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,680
but,

207
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,280
what made me a lot more sick than 39 dead cultists,

208
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,740
and, you know,

209
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,220
we could have,

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,560
if we were gonna do it,

211
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,860
it'd be 39,000.

212
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,980
It'd be Reeboks, not Nikes.

213
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,320
But,

214
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,360
the saddest thing about it was the way the normals got on television after that and said,

215
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,980
aren't those people so silly with their ridiculous superstitions?

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,580
Uh,

217
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,580
our god,

218
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,220
our invisible god doesn't kill us.

219
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,760
My invisible monster is bigger than your invisible monster.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

221
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,660
And, friends, that's what most religions are all about.

222
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah.

223
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,040
Yeah.

224
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,680
And you may laugh at that,

225
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
but I'm afraid to tell you that,

226
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,860
according to the latest study I saw,

227
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,340
over 87,000,

228
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:55,560
87% of Americans believe that there is an invisible monster that will take care of them if they kiss its ass,

229
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,260
and,

230
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,220
you know,

231
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,920
cause their enemies bad luck if they pray enough.

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,800
And, friends,

233
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,720
because of those idiots believing in that monster,

234
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,820
there is one.

235
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,180
He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by.

236
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,840
But, friends,

237
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,920
you can fight back!

238
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,720
Yes!

239
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,260
We can turn the tables,

240
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:16,880
and,

241
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,420
we can declare war on God!

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,520
Yeah!

243
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,340
That takes a lot of fucking nerve!

244
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,560
That's the first night I've ever,

245
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,400
we mentioned this on the radio once,

246
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,700
was the first time in public that we have publicly declared war on God!

247
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah!

248
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,180
Frankly, some people might say that was real disrespectful sounding.

249
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:39,880
Yeah!

250
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,180
But, just between you and me,

251
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,980
the way if I was gonna have a God,

252
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,320
it wouldn't be the kind that required little old ladies,

253
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,560
to defend it.

254
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,880
You know what I mean?

255
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
Like that guy in Pulp Fiction said,

256
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,080
Vengeance is mine!

257
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,900
Saith the Lord!

258
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,280
Which means,

259
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,920
if we're fucking up,

260
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,680
then let God worry about it, okay?

261
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,780
Or as that little old lady wrote to the Dallas Morning News,

262
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,480
all those Southern Baptists don't want those homosexuals going into Disneyland,

263
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,100
and,

264
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,540
isn't it bad enough that they're gonna spend eternity in hell?

265
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,300
What can't the Baptist do?

266
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,960
The Baptist let them go to Disneyland first!

267
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,920
So friends,

268
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,560
we,

269
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,020
you, I think you,

270
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,080
most of you understand what we mean when we say we're declaring war on God.

271
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,140
Repent, friends!

272
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,180
Repent through spending!

273
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,260
And you better do it quick,

274
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,140
we've only got,

275
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,660
according to my computer,

276
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,620
only 295 days left,

277
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,380
before X-Day,

278
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,380
July 5th, 1998,

279
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,280
that's September,

280
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,000
7 o'clock in the morning,

281
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,240
which is of course the end of the world,

282
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
as they know it,

283
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,860
the end for the,

284
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,080
uh,

285
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,120
pinks and so forth,

286
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,360
but,

287
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,800
I imagine most people here already understand enough about Bob,

288
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,740
the church,

289
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,560
and so forth,

290
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:01,960
don't you?

291
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,940
Is anybody here that needs to have it explained to you?

292
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,340
Meet,

293
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,680
well,

294
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,100
you can meet Dr. LeHume and me out back there for the show,

295
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,700
and we'll,

296
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,940
we'll straighten that out for you.

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
Now I can either leave the communion,

298
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,060
or I can do my off,

299
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,700
so be bitter.

300
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:17,700


301
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,740
You'll be fine.

302
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:20,740


303
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:20,880
Bob,

304
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
billionaire regại .

305
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
Love,

306
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,240
chapter three,

307
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,240


308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,240


309
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,240


310
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:40,860
marina so many soga drew So your doing on me.

311
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,760
Satan's cheerleaders.

312
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,800
Satan's cheerleaders.

313
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,400
All right.

314
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,760
Satan's cheerleaders.

315
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,080
Jesus is speaking, friends.

316
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,040
I am the Lord Jesus Christ.

317
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,900
Oh, yeah.

318
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,560
Oh, we forgot to impact while we were thanking, you know, the lighting man, the band, and Friday, and then the light and so forth.

319
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,640
We forgot to mention Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God.

320
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
You're the business manager for the church in the South.

321
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,060
Oh, there's older brother Satan, that old serpent, also here.

322
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,540
Now, you boys don't be fighting.

323
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
They're always arguing over who's dad's favorite.

324
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh, look, isn't that nice?

325
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,740
No, that's okay.

326
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,420
Come on, you guys.

327
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,300
We need to pass out the Kool-Aid.

328
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,100
I think Satan's the lovely cheerleaders.

329
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,760
Yes!

330
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,940
We have, what are these again?

331
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Satan's snap and Kool-Aid.

332
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,720
All right.

333
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
Hey.

334
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,140
Glad you made it.

335
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,940
Thanks for coming.

336
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,020
You too.

337
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,720
You and you.

338
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,380
You too.

339
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,320
Racklin' Rosie, get on board.

340
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,080
We gonna ride till there ain't no more to go.

341
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,100
Taking it slow.

342
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,140
Lord, don't you know.

343
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,420
I'll have me a time with the poor man.

344
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,840
Man's lady hitchin' on a twilight train.

345
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,540
And she doesn't hear that I care to take along.

346
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,780
Maybe a song to sing when I want.

347
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,420
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune.

348
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,200
Oh, I love my Rosie child.

349
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,320
I love my Rosie child.

350
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,320


351
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,200
You and me, we're going in style.

352
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,420
Racklin' Rosie, just an odd woman.

353
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,020
But you make me sing like a guitar strumming.

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,560
Hang on to me, girl.

355
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,620
The song keeps running.

356
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
Ah!

357
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:55,740


358
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,860
Ah!

359
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,660
Ah!

360
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:00,760
Ah!

361
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:01,600


362
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:01,680


363
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:01,880
Ah!

364
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,100


365
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,200
Ah!

366
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,400
Ah!

367
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


368
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


369
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


370
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


371
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


372
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


373
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


374
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


375
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,400


376
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,340
Ah!

377
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,440
Play it now.

378
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,960
Play it now.

379
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,560
Play it now, my baby.

380
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,740
Racklin' Rosie, make me smile.

381
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,620
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, well, that's all right.

382
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,940
We got all night to set the world right.

383
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Hang on to me and then fuck my asshole babe.

384
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,100
Oh, I love my rosy child.

385
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,180
She got the way to make me happy.

386
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,100
You and me, we're going in style.

387
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,320
Franklin, Rosie, the store-bought woman.

388
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,800
You make me sing like a guitar strumming.

389
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,380
Hang on to me, girl, the song keeps running.

390
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:23,240
Oh, I love my rosy child.

391
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,980
Oh, I love my rosy child.

392
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,020
Oh, I love my rosy child.

393
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:54,880
Oh, I love my rosy child.

394
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:28,860
Oh, I love my rosy child.

395
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:59,080
Oh, I love my rosy child.

396
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:28,680
Oh, I love my rosy child.

397
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:59,080
Oh, I love my rosy child.

398
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:27,480
Oh, I love my rosy child.

399
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,800
Oh, I love my rosy child.

400
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,200
Oh, I love my rosy child.

401
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
The first miracle friend.

402
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,220
If he had been normal, that would have killed him.

403
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,080
guitar solo

404
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,860
guitar solo

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,080
guitar solo

406
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,080
guitar solo

407
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,080
guitar solo

408
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,120
guitar solo

409
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,120
guitar solo

410
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,600
guitar solo

411
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,080
guitar solo

412
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:59,080
guitar solo

413
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,640
guitar solo

414
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,940
guitar solo

415
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,100
guitar solo

416
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,140
guitar solo

417
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,720
guitar solo

418
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,220
guitar solo

419
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,900
guitar solo

420
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,520
guitar solo

421
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,780
guitar solo

422
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,060
Thank you.

423
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,420
Do not be fooled by the blatant subgenius propaganda you may have heard on this radio station.

424
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,940
These people are liars. They will lie to deceive you.

425
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,080
They worship no true God, but the true God.

426
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,320
They follow the crazed babblings of the brain-damaged J.R. Bob-Dogs, supposed child of space aliens.

427
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,520
They sell humans to the graves and harvest the leftovers for slack plans.

428
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,460
Sleep is their form of prayer.

429
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,020
They make a mockery of all who oppose them and all who join them.

430
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,960
If you are foolish enough to join Bob, you could be taken away at any moment to Malaysia,

431
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,980
where naked women will perform the third nostril opening.

432
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,880
And make you sensitive to the smells from beyond.

433
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,360
Don't inhale while the subgeniuses are still spreading their evil.

434
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,720
Only breathe God's air.

435
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,240
You must help us stop them.

436
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,120
Send one dollar to Ban Organized Blasphemy, B.O.B.

437
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:57,100
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

438
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,880
A murmur of faith from the heart of the Bible Belt.

439
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,120
Snap out of it. Billions of tormented souls are burning in hell.

440
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,100
And you're one of them! But this is only the top floor of hell!

441
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,040
And when the demons try to tell you that, you think it's some kind of a satire or a comedy show.

442
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,040
Yes?

443
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,300
If you need to fill time, Bob is commanding me to speak right now.

444
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,020
I'm one of the mystery souls that was saved by suicide a few months ago, as prophesied in the last bulletin.

445
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,460
And I have a great message of slack for Austin.

446
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, sure! Go ahead.

447
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,700
If it goes on for more than about two minutes, we'll pull the big hook out.

448
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,460
Unless it's really good. Then we'll worship you instead of Bob.

449
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay, now I can keep this brief, people. I want to tell you something.

450
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Two weeks ago, you know what I did?

451
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,040
What did you do?

452
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
I quit my motherfucking job!

453
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,280
Woo!

454
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,420
Now, I was a waiter at a restaurant. And not just any waiter. I was the head waiter, okay?

455
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,260
I had responsibilities. I had burdens. And boy, these people were evil, man.

456
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,980
We're talking conspiracy. And you know what I did?

457
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,380
I waited until 12.30 until I was holding down a ten-top, three two-tops, a six-top, and a four.

458
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,580
And I walked right the fuck out of there!

459
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,220
Alright, now, people, my soul is very, very troubled.

460
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,580
I was not kidding about that suicide remark.

461
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,700
Yes, folks, it was Bob that saved me when that pamphlet arrived and said,

462
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,700
We know that two mystery souls have been saved from that act of self-destruction.

463
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,760
I knew it was me, and I persevered.

464
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,420
Now, I have been...

465
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,760
Bob, kill me!

466
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
I have been struggling in my heart now.

467
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,660
Now, I'm either going to go off to the Himalayas and live in a cave for the rest of my life...

468
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,420
Me, too!

469
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,200
...or I'm going to start a church, and it's called Bob's 23rd Universal Church of the World.

470
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,440
And I'm going to start it right here in Austin.

471
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,800
Alright?

472
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,280
Now, this shouldn't have happened.

473
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,460
This shouldn't be the first Texas event in five years, dammit!

474
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,840
I bought my salvation for $20, okay?

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,760
I'm an original old dude paying trips as a subgenius member!

476
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,160
I've been at this for a while, folks.

477
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,180
My name is Dr. Juggle.

478
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,220
I've been juggling for 13 years, and the reason I'm not rich at it is because I don't want to stand around and make a bunch of conspiracy geeks laugh.

479
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,440
Alright?

480
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,180
That's what they want from me.

481
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,300
They want serious entertainment.

482
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,780
They want to laugh.

483
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,820
They want to forget how much the world sucks.

484
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,780
Well, I can't.

485
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,640
Juggle for Bob!

486
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,120
Now, the reason I'm not juggling tonight is because I'm drunk, goddammit, and I deserve it!

487
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,740
Alright, now, I want to ask you people a question, because this will really help me out, alright?

488
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,540
Ask us.

489
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,160
Now, should I go to the Himalayas?

490
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,480
Yes!

491
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,860
Or should I hit Austin with the biggest slack crusade the world has ever seen?

492
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,880
Thank you, people.

493
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,500
Now, you might know me as the man who smashed my watch tonight, or had it smashed for me, alright?

494
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,600
I am no longer wearing Satan's handcuffs, and Austin is going to hear about it.

495
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,760
Remember, my name is Dr. Juggle.

496
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,140
Now, I'm not on the internet or anything like that.

497
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,500
Because I'm a poor motherfucker.

498
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,480
I haven't been able to afford a computer that I spent all my money on dope for the past ten years just to keep from killing myself!

499
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,700
Alright, now, I don't smoke pot anymore.

500
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,240
I quit three and a half months ago, folks.

501
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,320
So I'm fucking insane, alright?

502
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,580
I just needed it to keep me under control, and it's not going to happen anymore.

503
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,300
So look out, Austin.

504
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,080
I'm on the way, and I need your support.

505
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,780
Thank you.

506
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,520
And it is an honor to be here tonight with Dr. Ivan Stang, Reverend Ivan Stang, whoever the hell he is.

507
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,980
And I turn you back over to him now.

508
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,700
Thank you very fucking much.

509
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,320
Please, the juggler.

510
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,640
Go for the juggler!

511
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,240
Please, the introducer.

512
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,820
Oh, friends, miracles and miracles tonight.

513
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,200
I want to talk to you for a couple of minutes.

514
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,200
Talk to us.

515
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,140
Now, you haven't been making the transformation because you haven't been getting the information.

516
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,520
Can I get a praise Bob tonight?

517
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,840
Praise Bob!

518
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,740
You ought to be reading now.

519
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,220
You ought to be meditating.

520
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,720
I don't care about the storm that's coming up the next day.

521
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,540
You've got to get right with Bob.

522
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,820
Do I have to preach for myself tonight?

523
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,000
Bob will change the way you walk.

524
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,860
Bob will change the way that you talk.

525
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,660
Bob will change the way that you dress.

526
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,020
Bob will change the way that you think.

527
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,460
And we're here to help you make the journey tonight.

528
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,220
Thank you.

529
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,700
Friends, I'm going to take him.

530
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:16,700


531
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:16,700


532
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,900
I'm going to take a second to recognize a special being in the Church of the Subgenius.

533
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,380
Thank you.

534
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:32,480
When Jesus came back to earth, he came straight back to the one church with a fucking attitude.

535
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,000
If you read your Christian Bible, it clearly states in Luke 12 51,

536
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,780
Do you think I've come back to bring peace to earth?

537
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,420
No, I tell you, I have come to divide.

538
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,120
Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for our Lord and Savior, Reverend Jesus H. Christ.

539
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,420
Thank you.

540
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,000
All right, Jesus.

541
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,960
Come here and tell me something there, Jesus.

542
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,200
Fuck it, Henry.

543
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,440
Thank you.

544
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,280
I told you, folks.

545
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,800
Go ahead.

546
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,500
That's it.

547
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:12,820
Okay.

548
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,560
We told you that the slack starts here tonight.

549
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,400
Where?

550
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,660
Tonight is the start of your transformation.

551
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,380
When?

552
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,340
Tonight is the start of your own creativity.

553
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,560
What?

554
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:28,900
Yeah.

555
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,800
You'll learn the hate that cleanses the world.

556
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,440
Thank you.

557
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,940
And the man to show you the way is Dr. Katahdin Lagoon.

558
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,620
Yeah.

559
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,820
Yeah.

560
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,160
Yeah.

561
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:40,920
Yeah.

562
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,440


563
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,860
Yeah.

564
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,240
Yeah.

565
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,580
Yeah.

566
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,720
Thank you, man.

567
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,340
It is a challenging time in life.

568
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,600
It may be in our memory to do music but it is in our soul.

569
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,600


570
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,200
It is.

571
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,500
It is.

572
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,880
I love that Cantor pair because it takes determination to grow and give.

573
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,200
It's for sure.

574
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,780
We're going to stay there.

575
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,000
We'll keep doing it.

576
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,140
We're going to do this.

577
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,140


578
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,440
So jelly.

579
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,620
And it will be a painful race it's not going to be easy.

580
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:06,900
This song does make you feel some tired.

581
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:06,900


582
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,560
And you switch gr الح навadilles.

583
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,560


584
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,560


585
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,720
All right, guys.

586
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:09,720


587
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:09,720


588
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,200
One thousand.

589
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,300


590
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,240
Three hundred.

591
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,360
Merry Christmas!

592
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,520
Oh yeah, see we got a whole bunch of saved in the audience tonight.

593
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,980
Well, I come all the way from Philadelphia tonight to have a little chat with y'all.

594
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,320
I wanted to tell you a story about when I was growing up.

595
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,040
In a little town called Oil City, Pennsylvania.

596
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,460
Every day I'd live in this dirty little town. It was always gray, it smelled bad there.

597
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:44,160
And every day I'd go with my mom and drop lunch off to my dad at work down at the oil fields.

598
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,660
And I'd look out there at them pumping that oil and I'd think it looked like they had punched a great big old wound in the earth.

599
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,300
And the earth was bleeding its thick black blood.

600
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,460
Yes, the earth was bleeding thick black blood and it smelled like blood and it looked like blood.

601
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,240
Oh yeah.

602
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,440
Yeah.

603
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,600
And every day, every day I'd wait for my daddy to come home from work.

604
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,080
And he'd come into the house and he'd be all covered in that thick black blood.

605
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,700
He'd have that blood in his hair.

606
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,640
He'd have that blood in his clothes.

607
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,480
He'd have that blood caked around his nails. He was covered in that blood.

608
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,480
And I'd look up at my daddy all covered with that blood and I'd say,

609
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,080
Daddy, someday I want to be just like you.

610
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,880
Oh yeah.

611
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,260
And I will, brothers and sisters, I will in just a few short months on X day, brothers and sisters,

612
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:57,240
I will be drenched in that blood because this is the generation that shall see the bleeding flesh of the earth and the broken bones of time.

613
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,020
Can I get a praise ball?

614
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,240
Yes, brothers and sisters.

615
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,920
Humanity is about to take the next big evolution.

616
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,800
The next big evolutionary step.

617
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,060
Into the grave.

618
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,900
Can I get an amen?

619
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,860
Amen.

620
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,460
Oh yes, can I get a praise ball?

621
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,680
Praise ball.

622
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,760
Oh, and brothers and sisters, there are people out there, you just heard them on the radio talking.

623
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,300
They think that being God's obedient little hand puppet is going to save them.

624
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,080
Praise puppet.

625
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,700
Let me tell you.

626
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,120
That is one mighty big fist to have shoved up your ass forever.

627
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,340
But then to each his own.

628
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,700
Praise the Father.

629
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,940
Oh yeah.

630
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,260
Yes, let me tell you about Christianity, brothers and sisters.

631
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,500
Christianity is kind of like a pair of them silicone titty implants.

632
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,360
Oh, they look great.

633
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,200
They feel great.

634
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,580
They leak.

635
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,800
But they're fake.

636
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,940
And deep inside lurks an ugly spark of cancer.

637
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,960
Yes, brothers and sisters, cancer.

638
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,480
The cancer of fear.

639
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,020
Kill me.

640
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,680
Oh yeah, the cancer of fear eats away at them.

641
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,680
That's what their whole religion's around, fear.

642
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
Fear of Satan.

643
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,960
Fear of sex.

644
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Praise sex.

645
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,440
Give me sex.

646
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,700
Fear of chupacabra.

647
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,880
Fear of chupacabras.

648
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,360
Fear of alien abduction.

649
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,700
Fear of paparazzi.

650
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,940
Why, they're afraid to wash their genitals because they don't want God to think they're masturbating.

651
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,600
Oh yes.

652
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
But little do they know.

653
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,760
They really do have something to fear.

654
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm not playing masturbating because I think I'm cleaning my genitals.

655
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,320
They have something to fear.

656
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,880
They have Bob to fear.

657
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,100
And they have his mighty Church of the Subgenius to fear.

658
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,020
They have X Day to fear.

659
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,760
Oh yeah.

660
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,520
They better be saving up some of that fear.

661
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,840
Maybe they should stop being afraid of washing their genitals and such.

662
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,000
Maybe they should store up some of that fear.

663
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Because they're going to need it come X Day.

664
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,920
Can I get an Amen?

665
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,780
Amen.

666
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,640
Oh yeah.

667
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,080
Put on your PJs, humanity, because it's bedtime.

668
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,220
Oh yeah.

669
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,040
And some of y'all are going to be curling right up with the rest of humanity.

670
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,900
Some of y'all are going to be curling up with the rest of humanity in that nice warm bed.

671
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,380
Yeah, nice warm bed.

672
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,780
Of course it's warm.

673
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,080
Your fucking house will be burning around you.

674
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,820
And you can't get out because your fucking world will be burning around that.

675
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,800
Oh yeah.

676
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,200
But brothers and sisters, there's something you can do about it.

677
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,160
You don't have to die.

678
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,920
Please?

679
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,520
Personally.

680
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,780
I really don't want anybody else to join the Church of the Subgenius tonight.

681
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,900
Because I'd like to kill you anyway.

682
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,960
If it wasn't for Bob, I'd probably be out trying to kill all the people who are members of the Church of the Subgenius.

683
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,980
Kill me now!

684
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,800
Oh yeah.

685
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,800
But that's out of my hands.

686
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,060
Bob's protecting you.

687
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,000
Kill for Bob!

688
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,080
Yeah, Bob's protecting you from me because he pays me.

689
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,280
Maybe.

690
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,800
Yeah, but there's something you can do about it, brothers and sisters.

691
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,300
What's that?

692
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,280
All you have to do is have in your pocket that Subgenius membership card.

693
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,420
Oh yeah.

694
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,020
That's like, that's not just a membership card.

695
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,220
That's a ticket.

696
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,540
It's a ticket on the escape vessels of the sex gods.

697
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,560
And on July 5th, 1998, they're coming.

698
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,960
And we'll be coming too.

699
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:10,840
Good!

700
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,600
Let me tell you, brothers and sisters.

701
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,220
I've got nothing to worry about.

702
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,740
I could go out and murder 100 people tonight.

703
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,720
Conspiracy couldn't do nothing.

704
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,840
I got my membership card.

705
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,380
Oh, they could give me the death penalty.

706
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,080
But I'll just rise again in July.

707
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,940
They could give me life in prison.

708
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,300
But their life won't be as long as mine.

709
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,500
I'll outlive them.

710
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,040
After all, they've only got a few months to live.

711
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,160
Bob will come and spring me.

712
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,900
I know he will.

713
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,840
Yeah, brothers and sisters.

714
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,720
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.

715
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,900
But there's not a lot of time remaining for you.

716
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,900
There's not a lot of time remaining for you.

717
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,380
It's just a few months away.

718
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,020
Y'all are going to die.

719
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,660
You don't understand.

720
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,340
All of you who don't have a Subgenius membership card are going to die.

721
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,720
Oh, yeah.

722
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,880
The river is rising, brothers and sisters.

723
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
The river is rising.

724
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,100
And you're going to drown.

725
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,860
Appreciate it.

726
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:19,540
Tonight, Bob Dobbs and his church of the Subgenius are offering you a personal flotation device.

727
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,760
Yes.

728
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:21,480
Yes.

729
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,740
A mighty surfboard of flak so that you can hang ten into Shangri-La.

730
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,060
Yes, brothers and sisters.

731
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,600
Yes.

732
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,920
Oh, yes.

733
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,500
The time.

734
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,120
The time is ticking away, brothers and sisters.

735
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,060
Like that little slam bracelet on your wrist.

736
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,540
The time is ticking away.

737
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,700
Just a few short months remain.

738
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:50,320
And yet, I know that some of you are going to walk out of here tonight without a Subgenius membership card in their wallet.

739
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,820
Well, on your way out, you should stop over at that sales table anyway.

740
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,320
Because over there at the sales table, they're selling these Bob boxes.

741
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,700
Boxer shorts.

742
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,260
Your money's still green.

743
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,980
And let me tell you, if you get a pair of those Bob boxer shorts, you take them home and you fold them up and put them in your drawer.

744
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,500
But you can take them out and put them, carry them with you on July 5th, 1998.

745
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,880
Because, brothers, when them saucers come, you're going to need a clean pair of underwear.

746
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,640
It's like your mama said, make sure you're wearing clean underwear.

747
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,140
You might get into an accident.

748
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,080
But it won't be an accident, brothers and sisters.

749
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,380
Let me tell you, Bob will be happy to leave you...

750
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,400
...twisted in the wind.

751
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,880
Amen, brothers and sisters.

752
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:53,420
But before I close out what I have to say tonight, I'd like to leave you all with three simple words.

753
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,560
Three simple words.

754
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,020
Three simple words that could save your life.

755
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,120
Don't fuck with me!

756
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,140
Don't fuck with me!

757
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:11,480
Sister.

758
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,140
Thank you.

759
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,020
Thank you.

760
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,860
Thank you.

761
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:02,980
Thank you.

762
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,820
Thank you.

763
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,940
Thank you.

764
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,260
Thank you.

765
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,460
Thank you.

766
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,860
Thank you.

767
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:46,560
Thank you.

768
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,540
Thank you.

769
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,180
They took me to Mrs. Hall's third grade class.

770
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,160
And they made me read Dick and Jane stories to the third graders.

771
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,540
And then they made me dress up in a giant bunny rabbit suit.

772
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,740
And I did a dance in a circle with this other guy who was dressed up to look like Barney.

773
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,180
And we danced around.

774
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,780
And then they made us listen to Helen Reddy records.

775
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,760
We had to dance to fucking Helen Reddy.

776
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,420
And it wasn't fun.

777
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,020
It wasn't fun, my friends.

778
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,580
But it wasn't that bad.

779
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,260
I mean, you know, compared to that one time.

780
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,380
You know, that one time.

781
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:40,500
It wasn't that bad.

782
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:25,420
It wasn't that bad.

783
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:34,520
It wasn't that bad.

784
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,000
They shocked the living ghee out of me.

785
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,080
Well, I guess that's it.

786
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,460
Thank you.

787
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,300
We're all through.

788
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:52,600
Thanks.

789
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,080
Thanks.

790
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,920
Thanks for coming out.

791
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,700
The stars will be right July 5th, 1998.

792
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,540
A deal shall be struck with the alien gods of the outer spaces,

793
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,480
and you can be a part of this contract.

794
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,980
Learn to summon the Elder Gods through exogasm.

795
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,860
Board the pleasure saucers and escape the inevitable destruction of this planet.

796
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,660
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

797
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,620
For further details, send $1 to the Subgenius Foundation,

798
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:46,520
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214,

799
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,780
or visit www.subgenius.com.

800
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,400
Well, that's that.

801
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:55,840
We did it.

802
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,020
I didn't say it would be good.

803
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,580
Oh, there seems to be someone here who had a problem with the church of the subgenius.

804
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,820
Well, somebody's been handing out these flyers.

805
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,480
I got one.

806
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,940
Did anybody see these?

807
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,000
There's some geeks.

808
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,200
Well, I shouldn't say geeks.

809
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,140
Hell, we're all geeks here.

810
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,280
Some, you know, the old...

811
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,900
Beware the subgenius.

812
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,840
Do not be fooled by the blatant subgenius.

813
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,300
Propaganda.

814
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,980
You may see here.

815
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,960
These people are liars.

816
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,420
They will lie to deceive you.

817
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,560
They worship no true God,

818
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,580
but follow the crazed babblings of brain-damaged J.R. Bob Dobbs,

819
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,840
child of space aliens.

820
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,440
Praise Bob.

821
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,300
They sell humans to the greys

822
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,500
and harvest the leftovers for slack glands.

823
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,220
Praise Bob.

824
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,500
Sleep is their form.

825
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,600
They make a mockery of all who oppose them and all who join them.

826
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,740
Praise Bob.

827
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,860
If you are foolish enough to join Bob,

828
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,180
you could be taken away at any moment to Malaysia,

829
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,320
where naked women will perform the third nostril opening

830
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,540
and make you sensitive to smells from the beyond.

831
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,480
Don't inhale while the subgenius...

832
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,860
are still spreading their evil.

833
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,100
Only breathe God's air.

834
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,820
And if you must help us to stop them,

835
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,720
send one dollar to...

836
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,700
Oh, okay.

837
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,380
BAM Organized Blasphemy.

838
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,820
P.O. Box 14306 Dallas, Texas 711.

839
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,360
A murmur of faith from the heart of the Bible Belt.

840
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,080
Woo-hoo!

841
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:50,940
Woo!

842
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,060
I mean, that's all that aside.

843
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,240
Not, you know, as a side dish,

844
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,000
but just completely off to the side.

845
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,440
Then you got your third eye magnets,

846
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,640
your force field firewall people,

847
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,340
you've got your intruders from Dimension Omega,

848
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,300
you've got your craptons of industry,

849
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,920
you've got your Polaroids for Science,

850
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,900
and that includes a number of genetically altered and mutated

851
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,980
people who sell pickles.

852
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,540
You know, and that's their pizza front.

853
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,980
But that's the whole thing.

854
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,760
If you're asking me, it's like the rats in the basement.

855
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,660
It's all the shit, you know.

856
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,660
But did you...

857
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,460
Did they give you the discount?

858
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,460
Si, si, yes, they gave me the discount.

859
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,200
It was only, uh, well, look, I have to sign here.

860
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,740
If I get a blue card, that means I come more than twice a week.

861
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,100
If I come three times a week, I automatically get a gold card.

862
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,500
I get a gold card, it means, man, that I go down to 20% discount for everything.

863
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,180
I mean, that's a deep discount, man. That's pretty deep.

864
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,520
That's as deep as the ocean, and twice as wide.

865
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,720
People always put me down

866
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,900
They're screaming and I'm walking on sacred ground

867
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,040
Well, people got to try and see

868
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,980
That I'm doing what I want now

869
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,880
So let me do this

870
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,220
Hey!

871
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,360
Talkin' bout a feeling that is making me feel afraid

872
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,900
Hey!

873
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,220
Talkin' bout a feeling that is making me mad

874
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,400
I don't really think what I'm doing is all that bad

875
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,660
And hey!

876
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,820
I'm just singing out of part of my soul

877
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,940
And I'm going to keep on trying to get to my goal

878
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,400
Hey!

879
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,000
Hey!

880
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,400
Hey!

881
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,600
Hey!

882
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:11,800
Hey!

883
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,440
Hey!

884
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:12,520
Hey!

885
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:12,640
Hey!

886
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:12,800
Hey!

887
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,280
Hey!

888
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:13,440
Hey!

889
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:13,480


890
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:13,700
Hey!

891
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:13,780


892
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,020
Hey!

893
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,960
Hey!
