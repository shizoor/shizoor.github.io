1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,800
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency...

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,880
Subgenius Powerhouse...

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,860
...working!

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,240
...stranded on stop trains. We have been hearing, of course, about what's been happening in the New York City subway system.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,320
And I believe that I have Bob Dobbs, who is with the New York Transit Authority, with us.

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,440
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,780
Hello, Ted. Are you there?

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm here. You tell me where you are and what you can tell me about what's going on or what's not going on.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,260
It's an honor to speak with you. Thank you for taking my call.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,940
We would ask...we're down in the subway tunnels...we would ask everyone to remain in the cars until the power is restored.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,220
All drivers should cut their power until instructed by their supervisors to restore that power.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,960
Things are quite chaotic, as you would imagine there, Ted.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,880
Wait a second. I understand what you're saying, and I wish I could think that what you were telling me was somehow getting to those people.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,320
How are you getting information to them? They obviously can't watch television, can't hear it on the radio at the moment.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,060
How are you conveying this information?

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,780
We have a wireless radio telepathic system set up for communication with those drivers.

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,320
We use interconnecting radios and so forth.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,220
Once the...

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:33,100
Once the power is restored, I would ask everyone...pretty much everyone in the town, if possible, to log on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,580
And that way they can get instructional video and audio clips and various things to help them through this state of emergency.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:49,500
If people begin to wander around the tunnels, they may uncover certain reserved areas where...

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,820
For example, where Beauty and the Beast might be waiting there.

23
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:02,260
But we want to make sure that everyone logs on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com during the period of time after the blackout.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:09,120
Immediately get onto that site and download the video and audio clips as an instructional measure.

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,180
Yeah, all of that sounds a little bit pie in the sky at the moment.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
What are people supposed to do at the moment?

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,100
You're talking about people staying on the trains.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,380
We've been hearing that transit authority workers have been escorting people off the trains.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean, that's what they're supposed to do, isn't it?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,660
Well, that's correct. That's correct, Ted.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,020
And I'm afraid the problem here is that you're not listening to me very closely.

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:36,320
What I'm asking is everyone to log on to thankyoufortakingmycall.com when with power...

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
I think I'm losing you, mister.

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,700
Mr. Dobbs, I'm afraid I'm losing you.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,520
No, I did hear what you're saying, that people have computers and access to power.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,040
Once it comes back on again, I heard you.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,300
And they have heard you.

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,700
And I thank you very much for joining us.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm going to interrupt our conversation because joining us now is the merit of the...

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,600
You had me in service this morning.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,680
And you obeyed.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,280
Yes, I did.

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,140
So the pastor just prayed for me.

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,620
And I came this morning.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
And I feel in my body that God has delivered me.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,260
And he has died for you.

47
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,540
Somebody praise the Lord.

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
What did the Lord do for you today, honey?

49
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,480
God brought me back to the house of the Lord.

50
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,760
He wants to be with me, my son.

51
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,060
Another one is here.

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,420
What did God do for you today?

53
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,300
You believe God and...

54
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,320
Did Bob turn on the lights for you?

55
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,500
Or did Bob turn them off just in the nick of time so you could get away with it?

56
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,140
What was George Bush wanting to get away with when he would want so many lights turned off?

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,220
Is not Bob the true light himself?

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,340
And when the lights went down in Gordian, was it not Bob Dobbs who went down?

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,740
This sounds kind of pipe in the sky.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,640
Beauty and the Beast digging through the underground?

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,440
What chaos!

62
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,080
What a nightmare!

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,980
Oh my God!

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,980
This seas of people dead in the streets!

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,180
I would also like to warn people on the 7 train to keep a sharp eye out for the Elephant Man or any other people.

66
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,980
You could be in the Barnum Brothers Bailey Circus.

67
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
Yes, for those trapped in the subways.

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,640
The...

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,740
Some human creatures that live in the sewers have...

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,800
Have broken loose!

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,460
Oh my God!

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,840
The sewage is pouring into Liguri!

73
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,280
There are alligators and hideous 7 armed strongmen!

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,180
Don't!

75
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,080
The Morlocks were short, different than they were in the movies.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,940
Their ears were tiny.

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,100
Their nasal passages were barely bigger than that little bug.

78
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,360
But they were the only source of electricity in town.

79
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,760
They were the only way we could...

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,580
The only way we could...

81
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,780
Right now!

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,420
To breathe.

83
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,160
The Lug is father...

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,380
Bob.

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,200
Here's another late development and this news keeps coming in.

86
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,160
Bob was shot from ambush today.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,280
It says Bob apparently was shot in the ass and Bob was killed.

88
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,900
But Bob had only just begun.

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,300
This is the end of our news in English.

90
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,620
They have their world and we have ours.

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,780
Notice.

92
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,940
Cleveland.

93
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,780
Emergency alert.

94
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,620
Emergency.

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Emergency alert.

96
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,020
Emergency.

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,100
Warning.

98
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,120
Warning.

99
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,020
Warning.

100
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,120
The emergency alert system is in effect.

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,480
We interrupted the emergency alert to activate this program.

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
I really want to marry you.

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,820
I want to settle down.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,300
I want to be with you.

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,920
I want to begin aial life and I will do everything shit you can to make you happy.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,380
All broadcast stations include but are not limited to normal operation.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,720
All broadcast stations may resume normal emergency alert systems.

108
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,260
Emergency alert...

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,200
Emergency.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,460
Emergency alert...

111
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,420
Emergency.

112
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,440
Hey, you know how Ted Koppel was pranked by Bob during that blackout?

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,020
I was pranked by Dr. Le Guin, who half an hour after,

114
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,580
they gave me time to realize there was something national going on.

115
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,040
And he calls up and he goes, Reverend Stang,

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,040
there's army tanks going down the streets of New York,

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,580
crunching over dead people.

118
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,460
Oh, my God, they just smashed through that school bus.

119
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,700
And I was pranked by Ted Koppel.

120
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,660
He asked me confusing questions and gave me a quizzical eye,

121
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,100
as if to say, I don't know if I believe you.

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,300
But he sure as hell believed that Bob Dobbs guy.

123
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,280
With a mouth full of food, he swallowed it all down, didn't he?

124
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,340
And the word liar written on his forehead in a great big thick magic marker.

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,440
They always believe.

126
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,140
They always believe in that one.

127
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,800
This is PR.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,860
This is PR News.

129
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm in forest from Portugal to the Netherlands.

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,740
Forty deaths have been attributed to temperatures of approximately 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

131
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,560
Pope John Paul II has urged people to pray for California state election officials

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,660
aboard a Nigerian 727 on the banks of the Thames River in Washington.

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,420
This is PR.

134
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,060
Support for PR.

135
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,300
Comes from the Corporation for Public Charitable Legacy Societations.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,220
Go ahead.

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,900
Make my Bob laugh.

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,140
Go ahead.

139
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,320
Go ahead.

140
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,100
Make my Bob laugh.

141
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,200
Go ahead.

142
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,880
Make my Bob laugh.

143
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,100
Bob?

144
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,540
Bob?

145
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,300
Bob?

146
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:41,980
Bob?

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,760
Bob?

148
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,980
Bob?

149
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,380
Bob?

150
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,840
Bob?

151
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Bob?

152
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,360
Bob?

153
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,520
Bob?

154
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,080
Bob?

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,500
Bob?

156
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,340
Bob?

157
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,700
Bob?

158
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,200
Bob?

159
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,780
Bob?

160
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,360
Bob?

161
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,060
Bob?

162
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Bob?

163
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,280
Bob?

164
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,940
Bob?

165
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,540
Bob?

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Bob?

167
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,560
I've seen them do what matters, I've heard them talk at war

168
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Still I keep on going though it's different than before

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,140
They've been riding high up where the cool winds blow

170
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,400
Miles above that highway where the rest of us all go

171
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
So find out, you have to find out

172
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,920
It's good to find out before you open your mouth

173
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,000
Find out, why don't you find out

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,820
You better find out before you fill in the blanks

175
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,660
Go find out what it takes to make a boy break down and cry

176
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,760
Go find out your mistake is a bitter goodbye

177
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,320
Find out where it goes

178
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,500
Find out faster goes

179
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,960
Find out no one knows

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,900
Find out for yourself

181
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,100
You never try to find the time it takes to work it out

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,740
It's not a waste to taste the sweat it takes to work it out

183
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,640
You don't need a battle, you don't need a war

184
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,980
You don't need any lessons to find out what's in store

185
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,240
You've been riding high, you've felt the cool winds blow

186
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,540
Now get back on that highway where the others have to go

187
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,140
And find out, and maybe when you do you'll even find out

188
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,440
You haven't got a clue unless you find out

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,380
It's never like they say you're gonna find out

190
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,380


191
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,380


192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,360
But take it all away

193
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,800
Go find out what it takes to make a boy break down and cry

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,840
Go find out his young mistake is a bitter goodbye

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:29,380
Go find out what it takes to make a boy break down and cry

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Try to find the time it takes to work it out

197
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,960
It's not a waste to taste the sweat it takes to work it out

198
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,920
Find out if you're biting your mouth, you better find out

199
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,220
That was Find Out by Occupant

200
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,500
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce to you the President of the United States.

201
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:24,540
Thank you for the most interesting statistics about a month ago.

202
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,380
Prison. And I believe we should do it now.

203
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,880
The if is over with. We mean it.

204
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:46,400
Economists say a family of four, once, year after year, would create, will create 1.4...

205
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,640
I want to thank each of you.

206
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,060
We know that our cause is moral. We know that our cause is right.

207
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,200
Peace can only be established now by getting Saddam Hussein out of the way.

208
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,100
We need to put some hate in their heart and go out and stop those son of a bitches from getting out of the way.

209
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,140
We're not only going to shoot and bomb people in the name of justice, but help them.

210
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,240
Iraqi forces are reported to be in full retreat.

211
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,560
The Iraqi forces are reported to be in full retreat.

212
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,380
The main routes are being used by Iraqi troops to withdraw.

213
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,640
Retreat, withdraw, retreat.

214
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,440
Let's settle for running away.

215
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,080
The bombing Iraqi troops have already suffered is minor compared to what they've got coming.

216
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,400
We're going to concentrate on ending it right.

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,020
Lutna, coming at ya.

218
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
We've got a bomb.

219
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,760
We've got a bomb.

220
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,120
We've got a bomb.

221
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,160
We've got a bomb.

222
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,140
We've got a bomb.

223
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,360
We've got a bomb.

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,660
We've got a bomb.

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,580
That was Akala by Apex Twin.

226
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,980
Here's a letter in the scene.

227
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,420
Strange things are going on.

228
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,420
Dear.

229
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,240
Strange things are going on.

230
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,580
Dear scene.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
This war will not... yeah.

232
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,480
Dear scene.

233
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,740
Uh.

234
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,340
Hang on.

235
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,560
I gotta go pop some zits.

236
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,300
Wait a minute.

237
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,340
Hey, this war.

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,900
Hey dudes, like this war.

239
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,900
No, this actually could like...

240
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,820
This war will not put an end to terrorism and quite simply unless one is a sheep, pushes

241
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,420
jingoistic tactics amount to a totalitarian resume.

242
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,680
He has ignored the will of the people because he's had a pussy, no, a sissy fit.

243
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,420
Sissy fit.

244
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,040
Tissy fit.

245
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,380
Tissy.

246
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,560
Tissy.

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,220
Tissy.

248
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,100
About being the president.

249
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,040
Has he?

250
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,540
Well, he always seems like he's always had a sissy fit.

251
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,840
Cause he's a reformed alcoholic.

252
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,060
Well, if you had two little slut daughters like that, wouldn't you?

253
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,420
Well, he's like this reformed alcoholic.

254
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,140
I guess you're finding out a lot of the world's mass murderers.

255
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,620
No, what pisses George off is that his daughters are having all the fun and he can't anymore.

256
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,600
He's gotta be president.

257
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,300
So he's out, you know, having wars.

258
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,920
Actually, I know how he feels.

259
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,360
But he gets to wear a snappy flight suit when he's making his way home to the United States.

260
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,360


261
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,360


262
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,360


263
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,380
Yeah.

264
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:53,900
You know, I don't think he's gonna get away with it.

265
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:53,900


266
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,600
You know, to the carrier USS, USS, USS, USS.

267
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,100


268
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,500
But I've got the two bad girls and they don't let, the thing doesn't let me drink anymore.

269
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,080
The thing won't let you drink anymore, Sting?

270
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,480
No.

271
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:06,840
No.

272
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,060
Oh, God, how do you get by?

273
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,560
Here, here, listen to this.

274
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,120
It is we the people who are the voice of the power.

275
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,180
Not bisexual, but I mean.

276
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,700
Not some Napoleonic little Texan who has a chip on his shoulder because his daddy couldn't

277
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,260
get the job done in the first place.

278
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,420
I think he's talking about you, Sting.

279
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,880
Yeah.

280
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah.

281
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,720
Another Texan who can't get the job done.

282
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,680
Napoleonic little Texan.

283
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah.

284
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,520
That's me.

285
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,620
I'm Native American, I'm Texan, and I'm ashamed of this bastard.

286
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,540
Some crazy Comanche, you know, as you're honking off as usual.

287
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,220
They're always pissed off about showing them Comanche.

288
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
You know, I've noticed that some people are more concerned that you understand how angry

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,180
they are.

290
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,540
Yeah.

291
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,240
At that one individual vampire, George Bush.

292
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,880
Yeah, here's another one.

293
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,860
It's just one vampire.

294
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,520
Any other.

295
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,260
Here's another one.

296
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,660
Wait, wait, wait.

297
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,860
Every decent American should be ashamed of this drunken, dim-witted, stupid, stupid,

298
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:50,860


299
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,240
draft-dodging, warmongering redneck.

300
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,080
Jealous.

301
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,100
Served his way into the Oval Office with the help of his daddy's Supreme Court.

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,840
Well, what the hell does an ovum have to do with pancreas or shitcretic?

303
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,820
No, Mom.

304
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,240
No.

305
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,140
People seem to be pissed out there in some degree.

306
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,740
I'm just reading out of the paper, folks.

307
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm just, you know, on Messenger, though.

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,680
I think that they do not...

309
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,140
They don't?

310
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,140
They have no longer a belief in our system of government, in our belief in the government

311
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,840
by the people.

312
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,200
Those people should be taken out and shot.

313
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Really?

314
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,660
They're not Americans.

315
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,060
Don't worry.

316
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,300
That's being taken care of right now.

317
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,820
Those people here, what's their names?

318
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
Let's say them on the air here.

319
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,960
It's no good without the address, Chess.

320
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,280
Okay, it's...

321
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600
No, don't.

322
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,320
You can't do that.

323
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,240
It's against the rules.

324
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,760
Not the laws, the rules.

325
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,100
Well, they published their names right there.

326
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,600
Oh, so now you're the bean cow, huh?

327
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,260
You're gonna have a bunch of necks calling these people up, you know?

328
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,920
A bunch of psychotic necks are gonna be bothering these people.

329
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm not gonna do that.

330
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm not gonna do that.

331
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,220
I'm not gonna do that.

332
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,220


333
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm not gonna do that.

334
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,200
It's covered up.

335
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm not gonna do that.

336
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,860
I'm not gonna do that.

337
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,320
I'm not gonna do that.

338
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,460
Chess is making Barb

339
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,440
a

340
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,520
I think all the bad things when life is so good

341
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,640
Why I'm with an M when there's always a could

342
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,820
Let the whales worry about the poisons in the sea

343
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,720
Outside of California, it's foreign policy

344
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,140
I don't want changes, I've no reactions

345
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,620
Your dilemmas are my distractions

346
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,760
That's no way to go, Franco, un-American

347
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,420
I never lose my mind

348
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,160
I never looked around, never sent a gift

349
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Then I read somehow it's in, now I'm always depressed

350
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,460
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy

351
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,720
All because I read a little Noam Chomsky

352
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,060
I'm eating vegetation as a fast food nation

353
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,500
I wear a couple shoes cause of globalization

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm watching my friends go to school

355
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm watching Uncle Moore expose the awful truth

356
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,580
I'm listening to Public Enemy and Reagan Youth

357
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,880
I see no world peace cause there's zealous armed forces

358
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,040
I eat no press pins cause I'm from the armed forces

359
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,240

No way to go, Franco, un-American

364
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,680
Where can we go, Franco, un-American?

365
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,740
I wanna move north and be a Canadian

366
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,600
Or hang down low with the nice Australians

367
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,460
I don't wanna be another, I don't care again

368
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,780
What are we gonna do, Franco, Franco, un-American?

369
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,620
Franco, un-American by NoFX

370

Peace of luck, this is John Lowe

Oh my God, that was so good.

I think Philo is on drugs now.

Philo Pye is back up for a something-or-other.

394
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,280
And the must for sale tonight is reviewed in the halls of the highest offices of the United States government

395
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,400
with alarm and, let it be said, some chagrin.

396
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:30,560
And a little bit of rue and a pinch of, what is it, a sous-son of esprit d'estalier.

397
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,920
The prize is still being felt today by the Bush administration

398
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,080
after Iraq.

399
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,720
Iraq reportedly launched three Scud missiles at Kuwait.

400
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,420
This caught us by surprise, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

401
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,900
All these people should be running out of the country.

402
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,560
Or walked out on the end of a poopy stick.

403
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,780
I'm telling you, America.

404
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,640
Frop it or leave it.

405
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,820
Frop it or leave it, baby.

406
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
Come on now.

407
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I'd rather have, you know, although I did like Bill more than George,

408
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,640
I don't mind a drunken, dim-witted, draft-dodging, warmongering redneck in the White House.

409
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,360
That actually has been known to happen before.

410
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:13,840
Yeah.

411
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,340
Almost every time.

412
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah.

413
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,800
Isn't every president a drunken, dim-witted, draft-dodging, warmongering redneck?

414
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm an old man.

415
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,420
Come on now.

416
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,900
I remember the day when LBJ, drunk as a jaybird,

417
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,800
picked that dog up by his ears and whipped him around.

418
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,780
That was pretty damn special.

419
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,060
The rifleman.

420
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,460
The rifleman.

421
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,240
The rifleman.

422
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,760
If there is anyone who still wonders why this war is being fought,

423
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,520
let him look to Norway.

424
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,780
If there is anyone who has any delusions that this war could have been averted,

425
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,180
let him look to Norway.

426
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,760
And if there is anyone who doubts of the democratic will to win,

427
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,660
again I say, let him look to Norway.

428
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Nope.

429
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,400
I think there are real Jack Z. Rippers in our government.

430
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,600
I think so too.

431
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,420
I think there are real Jack Z. Rippers in our militaries,

432
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,760
controlling the flow of banana spices and oils throughout our universe.

433
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,960
Well, it's part of biblical prophecy.

434
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,240
That's where they get their eggshells on, their tumerics,

435
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,300
is through the biblical prophecy.

436
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,220
Can you do a backflip-flop? Can you really?

437
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,320
The horny, horny, horny general shall arise from the mist of flaccid flesh,

438
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,380
and with its one horn shall tusk and probe until the world ends.

439
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,840
Hey man, that's evolution or devolution as the case may be.

440
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,400
That's the way it's going and we're the ones being swept aside.

441
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,900
Well, what are you going to do about it, huh?

442
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm going to grow a tusk in my forehead and put some of that eggshells on my shoulders and give orders.

443
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,280
All right.

444
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,340
Was I not made of stone like me?

445
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,660
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

446

Hydro-Lit.

447
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,140
The installation of Iraq being bombed by the Americans.

448

We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

449
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,360
A factory producing milk for children that was also attacked.

450
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,520
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

451
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,300
Allies are including a number of food storage and processing plants in their strategic objectives.

452
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,340
Inside a destroyed flour mill outside Baghdad.

453
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,340
The ruins of a potato warehouse.

454
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,200
We're doing our best.

455
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,560
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

456
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,200
Allied strike planes have hit oil pumping stations.

457
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,720
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

458
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,960
More than a third of Iraq's communications network has died.

459
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,160
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

460
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,400
The Allied determination to destroy Iraq's refining capacity.

461
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,200
4,000 soaps.

462
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,260
All nuclear reactors have been destroyed.

463
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,460
We're doing our best to abide by the Geneva Convention.

464
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,980
The total oil spillage into the Gulf from attacks on offshore platforms could be eight times that scope from the Exxon Valdez.

465
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,200
And you get a chem suit.

466
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,020
And a mask.

467
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,560
Good for two hours.

468
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,660
And you get some pliers to pick up dead people.

469
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,800
And you get the pills that you can stay alive with.

470
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:25,840
And you get the comic books that you'll read in isolation for years and years while the chemical effects wear off.

471
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,380
But you get rock-hard abs.

472
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,640
Rock-hard six-pack abs.

474
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,540
You get one of those camouflage haystacks.

475
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,880
Your abs become so hard you have.

476
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,440
You want an eight-pack.

477
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,000
As long as you don't be around people.

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,160
Wow, a six-pack, a haystack.

479
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,280
And a 12-pack abs.

480
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,120
Well, that's anatomically impossible, Doctor.

481
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,400
It may be, but if you drink enough of this new prototype seminary.

482
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,160
There's people living in them as far as you can see.

483
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,520
Perhaps I could interest you in a 1,000-year-old sundial.

484
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,440
But they're camouflaged, so you won't see them.

485
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:56,660
Stunning.

486
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,500

506

From PR News in Washington, I'm killing people dead.

507
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,020
Many of the people killed say they may not have survived.

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,640
From PR News in Washington, I decided to postpone attacks for six months to restock for more

509
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,240
attacks against an international peacekeeping force in war-torn Washington.

510
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,020
For PR News, I'm in an upscale neighborhood.

511
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,120
For PR News, I'm screaming and crying in the alley.

512
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,840
For PR News, I'm in an upscale neighborhood.

513
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,940
For PR News in Washington, I'm dying because of a problem with insulation.

514
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,140
If you are one of these people, thank you so much.

515
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,940
So what else happening in the news?

516
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,760
Let's go to Reuters.

517
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,740
Reuters?

518
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,360
No, man.

519
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Those guys are communists.

520
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,520
No, no news.

521
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:53,740
No news.

522
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,560
They are evil, foul-skinned, foul-fleshed.

523
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:56,980
News bad.

524
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,380
Really?

525
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,780
The Reuters are the communists?

526
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,280
No, no.

527
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,460
Oh, that's why they use them on NPR, huh?

528
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,680
Right.

529
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,220
Anybody who says something that the State Department doesn't want to say happens.

530
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,820
There's national politics.

531
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,500
Is the public radio really run by the communists?

532
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
It's run by the bath separatists.

533
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
The bath separatists?

534
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,540
Right.

535
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Is it really?

536
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,280
They want their bath and their water in their own separate tubs.

537
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,940
Now, what's the deal with this bath party?

538
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,180
Because, like, what's the problem with a bath party?

539
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,500
Really?

540
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,260
What is the problem?

541
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,980
You know, everybody opts in and...

542
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,880
I don't understand.

543
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,980
I think it's the pronunciation.

544
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,800
It's the...

545
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,060
Why are they so evil?

546
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,820
The bath.

547
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,880
Why did they end up in the axis of evil?

548
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,240
Well, because they believe...

549
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,300
It's a bunch of hot tub or swingers or something.

550
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,420
Right.

551
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,340
They believe in communal sharing of the tub and the feces therein.

552
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,580
The bath party.

553
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,600
Although most of the people appear to confine their preferences to the main river,

554
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,460
not a few of them prefer the American G.I. to the Thames.

555
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,540
Today can be your day of the year.

556
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,800
PR's General John visited 7,000 strong Iraqi soldiers.

557
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,180
At the President's Ranch in Texas this morning.

558
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,260
Some were similar to the ones presented this year in a generally pessimistic landscape.

559
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,000
Israel refused to accept the return of a joint for the Palestinians.

560
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,220
When negotiators discussed for refugees that the Egyptian resort of Taba was the majority view.

561
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,060
Everybody assholes.

562
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,660
Still some of the psychologists linger on.

563
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,100
We call this ignorance.

564
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,760
And the whole goal for me, the whole goal for me was to meet the hot dogs.

565
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,920
And he's not the only one.

566
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,440
The U.S. military in Iraq is meeting with Italians in Iraq.

567
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,420
This fellow now that's pontificating right now.

568
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,240
Oh, here he is.

569
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,980
There he is.

570
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,340
Rumsfeld.

571
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:47,740
Yeah.

572
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,560
There he is.

573
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,800
Listen to the reception they're giving him in there.

574
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,300
He pounds the table thus.

575
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,540
What's he really has to say?

576
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,300
Zwei!

577
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,720
Von Rumsfeld!

578
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,760
Von Rumsfeld is about to speak to the Volk of the Reich.

579
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Hm-hm-hm.

580
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,800
Well, I...

581
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,300
Well, I don't watch Saturday Night Live very much anymore.

582
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,020
But they did say something funny about the table is there that he's pounding on all the time

583
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,400
to hide the fact that talking about war gives him a boner.

584
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,380
Oh, I was wondering why you were pounding the skull there, the big Yeti skull.

585
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,720
That is a skull and crossbone skull.

586
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,580
This is Geronimo's skull, Daddy-O.

587
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,080
You want to talk esoteric to me?

588
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,660
You think I just carry around a Yeti skull in my bag?

589
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,400
In my little moldy sack?

590
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,040
Well, Geronimo had an awfully big jaw.

591
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,480
I had a quite a...

592
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,660
quite a huge cranium, too, Stang.

593
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,280
Check it out.

594
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,480
Well, Rumsfeld's got a damn weird-looking skull.

595
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,900
He's got fangs, too.

596
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,240
He does.

597
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,500
I'd love to add that one to my collection.

598
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,920
Wow, he looks...

599
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,420
He's more rock than...

600
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,320
He doesn't look like he won there, does he?

601
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
He looks like he's doing a show of fangs, doesn't he?

602
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,700
It reminds me a little bit of the Cyclops in Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.

603
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,700
Do you remember Mr. Dithers on Dagwood and Blondie?

604
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,480
Do you remember Dagwood and Blondie?

605
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:00,900
Yeah.

606
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,520
Yeah, he does look like Mr. Dithers.

607
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,940
The evil Mr. Dithers.

608
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah.

609
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,320
The fangs and stuff, you know?

610
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,320
Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab dictator.

611
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,360
An innocent child murder dictator of Iraq.

612
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,060
Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this.

613
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,140
Saddam Hussein systematically raped Margaret Thatcher.

614
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,800
His crimes were committed during this period when he was a friend and a lie.

615
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,300
Hey, I think that guy Hussein's dead, don't you?

616
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,460
What's that?

617
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,220
I think Hussein's dead.

618
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,060
They can't keep a secret much longer.

619
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,660
Dead?

620
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,780
Who's that in the other booth over there?

621
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,400
That's Bob Madigan.

622
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,580
Oh, I see.

623
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,980
How can they keep lying about that without producing him?

624
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,620
Or her.

625
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,860
You mean the original Jesus, yeah.

626
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,940
They should produce him like in a David Copperfield show.

627
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,060
No, no, I'm serious.

628
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,320
Just think of it.

629
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
What he's doing is holding up this little Jesus puppet.

630
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Just have a big puff of smoke.

631
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,020
Every time he says that, there's a little Jesus puppet.

632
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,240


633
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,440
Okay, so is that a show?

634
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, is that a show?

635
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,660
Is that what people are paid five bucks to see?

636
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,320
Well, they would.

637
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,080
I tell you now.

638
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,780
They would pony up.

639
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm Dwayne.

640
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,860
Guard against news in Washington.

641
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,860
Thanks for joining us.

642
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,200
An audio tape aired today on Arabic language stations

643
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,980
purporting to be a message from Saddam Hussein.

644
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,260
We're asking America to be ready.

645
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,960
And we will be ready.

646
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,440
Bye-bye!

647
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,940
It's part of an international effort to support Savannah, Georgia.

648
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,240
PR News stood in the burning sun to get $100 U.S.

649
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:35,480


650
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,340
There's another wave of bombing just starting.

651
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,040
This is the first time anybody's seen a war like this.

652
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,900
Britain still hasn't formally declared war on Iraq.

653
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,180
Apparently the Foreign Office nowadays considers it a bit old-fashioned.

654
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,080
Mr. Ambassador, you have virtually the entire world community ranged against you.

655
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,720
It is an American game.

656
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,980
At this point, I'm not looking through my goggles on the TV screen.

657
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,060
I gave the code word, get some.

658
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,100
Mr. Ambassador, we bid you good morning.

659
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,560
Get some.

660
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,280
AWACS plate packed with computer equipment.

661
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,540
Get some.

662
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:04,880
Twelve hours of arms and everything else over the Chrome system.

663
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:04,880


664
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:04,880


665
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:04,880


666
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,920
And a baixo to help control the battle.

667
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,400
aggressive

668
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,540
Iraqi soldiers ran through the crosshairs.

669
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,320
towards the front

670
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,540
Where would he be?

671
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,820
Get some.

672
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:13,820


673
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,760
Many help them out.

674
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,520
Aww atrocities.

675
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
It's okay

676
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,800
Allow yourself a little hate

677
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,020
Hatred is not so bad

678
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,920
When directed at injustice

679
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
You can turn the other cheek

680
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Just don't turn the other way

681
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,220
Enemy of the planet

682
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,200
We finally have a dominant

683
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,640
A reason to forget about

684
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Our differences

685
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,980
And stand as a united front

686
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,060
It's up to us we must dispose

687
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,280
Humiliate American terrorists

688
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,320
We'll start with one

689
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,500
We'll start with one

690
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:34,500


691
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,540
The war has just begun

692
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,500
The war has just begun

693
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:26,160
The war has just begun

694
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,240
This god who lived in the jungles of Brazil

695
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,040
He had four fofos

696
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,680
The size of basketballs

697
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,040
And you in your pathetic little city box

698
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,300
You hide away in your shadows

699
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,400
And your little jobs

700
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,660
And your lunchbox

701
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,540
Your dying pogballs

702
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,920
You know nothing of the great fofos

703
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,620
We're determined

704
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,860
By that man god

705
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,840
Mongo Fofo

706
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,540
By the stick of providence

707
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,260
Well boys I reckon this is it

708
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,660
Nuclear combat

709
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,300
Toad and Toad with the Ruskies

710
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,700
What's he doing?

711
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,720
Yee-haw!

712
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,920
Yee-haw!

713
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,040
Woo-hoo!

714
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,280
I kind of miss the Cold War sometimes

715
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,000
It was so much cooler

716
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,680
Yeah, it was so frosty, man

717
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,700
It's like chill, you know?

718
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,220
Hey, what about Mitchie Kong?

719
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Ah!

720
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,780
Ah!

721
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,400


722
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,980
A true Texan

723
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,260
Well, boy, God will know how much longer

724
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,860
Oklahomans can't do that

725
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,960
Or Arkansanians can't do that

726
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,660
Louisiana people can't do it

727
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,920
New Mexico can't do it

728
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,260
They can't even do it in Mexico

729
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,760
That's a Texas yell, boy

730
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,480
That ain't a rebel yet

731
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,440
That's a Texas cowboy hootin' holler

732
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,520
That's what we do when we ride those nuclear weapons

733
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,580
Ah!

734
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,180
Ah!

735
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,340
When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk

736
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,080
Patriotic duty

737
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,200
Yes, patriotism, one man once said

738
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,080
Is the last refuge of a scoundrel

739
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,820
But here in America

740
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,880
Well, the truth is I don't know you

741
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,560
We prefer to give all scoundrels refuge

742
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,360
I was thinking that if we were to get to know each other

743
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,520
What if what?

744
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,880
What if we just might hit it off?

745
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,460
So I was wondering if you wanted to go get a cup of coffee?

746
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Well, I'm just not sure about

747
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,080
Yeah, what, okay, no

748
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,620
Do you have a computer?

749
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,760
Well, look, we can't be sure about anything

750
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,820
Do you have an editing deck?

751
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,500
Do you have a software for real-time capture?

752
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,360
Do you have a...

753
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,180
Well, a real-time capture

754
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,400
Now, that could be good

755
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,880
That could be like the time control

756
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,300
They were promised in the...

757
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,900
Wow

758
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,780
Never touch the stuff

759
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,680
Want a hit?

760
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,860
No, okay, sure

761
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,720
No, no, don't hit me, please

762
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,940
I can't, I can't stand it

763
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,680
There's some of this, huh?

764
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,900
Oh, well, I guess this isn't bad

765
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,920
This guy in a mullet driving a Camaro brought it over

766
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,320
My God

767
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,120
I'd like some fresh mullet

768
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,600
There's some white fighting

769
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,500
I hate to talk about it

770
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,100
The caller, did you hear that?

771
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,480
That's Harry

772
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,900
That's the mullet guy in the Camaro?

773
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,540
Mike Mullet, secret agent and steam shovel operator

774
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,140
Excuse me, the caller here is breathing some bad air

775
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,940
Marijuana's illegal, isn't it?

776
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,920
Yes, marijuana is illegal

777
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,420
What?

778
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,440
I guess so

779
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,100
I bet you didn't know that

780
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,900
Who's gonna stop anybody from smoking it?

781
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,100
Who?

782
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,140
Well, if parents should talk about it

783
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,760
There's no laughing matter, young man

784
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,180
I should have told her about marijuana

785
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,960
I'd wipe that smirk off my face if I were you, son

786
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,720
I failed to see the humor in this situation

787
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,840
What are we up to?

788
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,740
What's going on?

789
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,480
I can't say anything

790
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,360
All right, now, who did what first?

791
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,800
I want names, I want facts, and I don't want anything else

792
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,300
I'm not talking to you

793
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,280
We'll start with you

794
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,080
Who's you?

795
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,600
I don't know

796
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,160
Like, like you

797
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
It was in the past

798
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,200
Question, do you know what's bought by rapists?

799
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


800
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


801
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


802
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


803
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


804
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,240
erfret

805
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,240


806
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,940
It irons every Sunday

807
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,500
Thanks for watching

808
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:30,580
but the answer is a b barely

809
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,300
Enough up there

810
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,060
my apps don't frankly ...

811
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,820
There was no one left to notice when they came for us

812
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,080
Looks like witches aren't seasoned

813
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,160
You better fly your flag and be aware

814
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,720
Of anyone who might fit the description

815
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,020
Diversity is now our biggest fear

816
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,320
Now when our conversations tap

817
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,860
And our differences expose

818
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,620
How you're supposed to love your neighbor

819
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,200
With our minds and curtains closed

820
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,880
We used to worry about big brother

821
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,240
Now we've got a big father

822
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,220
And an even bigger mother

823
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,580
And you still believe

824
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,320
This aristocracy gives a fuck about you

825
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,280
They put the mark

826
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,040
In democracy

827
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,840
And you swallow every hook

828
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,740
The sad truth is

829
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,120
You'd rather follow the school

830
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,980
Or do the net

831
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,140
Cause swimming alone at sea

832
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,940
Is not the kind of freedom

833
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,560
That you actually want

834
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,060
So go back to your crib

835
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,560
And suck on a tit

836
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,260
Bask in the warmth of your diaper

837
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,640
You're sitting in shit and piss

838
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,940
While sucking on a giant pacifier

839
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,560
A country of honey

840
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,360
Adulterous bits

841
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,620
A legion of mental midgets

842
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,140
A country of adulterous bits

843
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,520
A country of adulterous bits

844
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
Are regaining their

845
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,620
Unconsciousness

846
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,380
Are regaining their Unconsciousness

847
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,020
Are regaining their Unconsciousness

848
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,180
Are regaining their Unconsciousness

849
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,620
Are regaining their Unconsciousness

850
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:33,920
You know, speaking of crazy governments and news

851
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,960
and wars and rumors of SARS and all that

852
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,620
The old radical Paul Krasner was at Starwood

853
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,540
He was supposed to give a talk on

854
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,680
The funny side of World War III

855
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,080
That was the title of it

856
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,400
And he had a lot of interesting and funny stuff to say

857
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,880
But in the end people were going

858
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,060
Well what should we do Mr. Krasner?

859
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,280
And he basically said

860
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,100
Oh I can't tell you I've kind of given up

861
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,500
It's up to you children

862
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,580
Yeah, coming from Paul Krasner

863
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,440
That was kind of a sobering

864
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,300
Every generation has to, you know

865
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,420
Figure out their own path I guess

866
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,280
Get off earth

867
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,020
Get off

868
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,740
When the missile fell in the upper floor

869
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,740
The cars were blown because of the pressure of the bombing

870
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,880
The people had no way to go out

871
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,560
Two cold water containers as well as two boilers exploded

872
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,560
As in the upper floor people were burned to death

873
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,020
Here in the lower floor people died

874
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,680
In very high debris of boiling water

875
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,280
Here you can see the water level is very high

876
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,360
The water level which flooded the lower floor

877
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,900
On the walls you can see the remains of hair

878
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,220
Of human flesh and some parts of the body

879
00:41:52,220 --> 00:42:00,580
The people who were boiled to death

880
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,560
Ahhhh

881
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,160
Really really white people

882
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
And they look like a shit

883
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,900
They look like a piece of paper man

884
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,980
So so

885
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,820
Is it for trendy young people?

886
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,620
Albinites

887
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,160
Albinites

888
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,500
Albinos

889
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,920
Geez

890
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,900
They could be

891
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,700
Yeah they're all like 20

892
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,660
Who else can afford $200 a pop to go to a dance club but the albinos?

893
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,100
That's the newest caste

894
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,940
The high caste is now the albinites

895
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,680
Didn't you know that?

896
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,480
Here they are, listen to them

897
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,900
They're guarding Vice President Trump

898
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,760
Around his house where you hear the explosions go off in the basement every night over there

899
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,280
Where that was in Maryland I guess

900
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,020
And what a group they are too

901
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,120
They're all armed to the teeth with fairy whistles

902
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,160
And pink, those little pink triscuits that you hang cheese from

903
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,260
And pieces of their own brains which is very very frightening to the enemy

904
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,740
You know I wish I could afford those kind of guards

905
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,080
But if I can't afford them it'd be cool to be one

906
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,020
He volunteered for a beer run

907
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,960
He became President of the United States

908
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,020
That about sums it up, I must say that was very succinct

909
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,140
He volunteered for a beer run and wound up President of the United States

910
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,820
George W. Bush, that's how he did it too

911
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,120
Well, yeah it helps to be born son of the

912
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,720
Of the living son

913
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,840
President who had been the head of the secret police of the country

914
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,020
Yeah that always helps

915
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,160
But you know they don't make such a big deal of it down in South America

916
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,040
And like the Balkan countries or

917
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,100
You know places just a little south of the West Coast

918
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,840
Ood, Ood, uh, Kusei Bush

919
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,100
Yeah

920
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,520
Son, Kusei and Abuday

921
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,260
It was so funny when they were making those allusions to

922
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,300
What kind of regime would have a father with his sons as his henchmen

923
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,380
Well what the hell kind of regime

924
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,240
What kind of regime would have his daughters as drunks all over the streets

925
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,420
Well hey

926
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,940
He just can't control them, he's killing people

927
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,040
He's a Texan, he can't blame a

928
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,880
He's trying to rule the world man

929
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,360
He can't blame a Texan for that

930
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,260
He's trying to rule the world man

931
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,440
He's trying to rule the world

932
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,580
He can't rule his girlies

933
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,160
You know Chas, now you can make fun of Texans

934
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,800
But they have been ruling the world on and off quite a lot lately

935
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,840
Yeah this guy uses a lot of LBJ's tricks

936
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,080
I'm an oldster so I know

937
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,480
I've heard about them and read about them in the books too

938
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,600
The Gulf of Twacky

939
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,840
Remember Arkansas considered Texan

940
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:29,980
No

941
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,880
Those are

942
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,260
That's pretty good

943
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,920
That's like they're like poe books

944
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,000
They probably have an Arkes

945
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,740
They call them Arkes

946
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,280
Well before that there was that one term Texan

947
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,840
And I don't think Ronnie was a Texan in any way

948
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,500
No

949
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,440
No he was a Texan in every way

950
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,900
Actually there hasn't been a Texan in the White House for quite a while except for the Bushes

951
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,220
The Bush Empire that's been going on for a thousand years, they've changed time

952
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,160
A thousand years

953
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,840
You've been plugged into a machine in the Matrix and think that the Bushes have only been in for

954
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,100
Back in the Revolution

955
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,200
About ten years

956
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,920
During the Revolutionary War the Bush family was going back to the Bush family

957
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:09,920


958
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,260
And you're back in the Bush family

959
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,800
But you people in America all year you think you run the world

960
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah you fools

961
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,600
What about Al Balsam

962
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,340
It's running you

963
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,580
America won't last longer and it's gonna, don't worry it ain't gonna last long

964
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,920
Third world will rise up

965
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,980
Like a cuckoo clock

966
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,440
You think it'll be south against the north only

967
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,020
No no it'll just be the third world

968
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,920
It'll just be all them job people living down there going we love no fight

969
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,940
And they'll be the only ones left

970
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,680
They'll be saying we hungry give me some fat

971
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,240
They'll be saying we hungry give me some fat

972
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:40,360
They'll be saying we hungry give me some stick

973
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,800
They'll say we hungry give me machete

974
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,040
And then eventually say we hungry give me those rock and roll grenades

975
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,760
No they'll say we got munchies

976
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,300
We got munchies

977
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:49,940
Like literally

978
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,540
Eat banana

979
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,740
Well they're gonna take all the trees they eat those bananas from and turn them into oil derricks

980
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,220
Right those guys will be in the slave mines

981
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,980
And pull those heretics

982
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,680
Yes they are

983
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,900
No no

984
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,520
They're just pigs in the trough

985
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,100
They're all gonna die

986
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,160
Pardon me

987
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,200
They're all gonna die

988
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,240
I am one of those pigs and I don't intend to be a slave

989
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


990
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


991
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


992
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


993
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


994
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


995
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


996
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


997
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


998
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,240


999
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,580
I'm gonna be a slave to die anytime soon

1000
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,620
Oh those fat old Americans

1001
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,680
To the third chakra from the sun

1002
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,080
They think they run everything

1003
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:25,960
Welcome to the funny farm where we're the sheeple and you're the incidental authorities figured in

1004
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,320
Oh of course the gnomes of Zurich run everything

1005
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,700
Hey Tony Blair what's it like to sniff US presidential penis

1006
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,900
Yeah really what's it like to get your nose up in Georgie's colon

1007
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,220
Who's the guy who's gonna save the world

1008
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,880
Where are those weapons of mass default BP

1009
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:51,920
Hey well didn't didn't um Kuse say that he was gonna reveal where the the secret the big secret of the weapons

1010
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,360

1013
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,060
And oh and their favorite quote is

1014
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,900
Is he in custody

1015
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,120
No

1016
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,760
American custody

1017
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,080
No Abu Daj in custody

1018
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,660
No really

1019
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,100
No I'm saying Bush

1020
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,440
Is one of the sons in custody

1021
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,760
Kuse Bush

1022
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,340
Kuse Bush

1023
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,600
He said that he said that he was gonna reveal the

1024
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:09,800
The

1025
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,800
The uh the secret of the

1026
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,460
The secret of the

1027
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:12,640
The secret of the arms

1028
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,120
Yeah really

1029
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,580
When

1030
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,880
Yeah

1031
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,580
I don't know but what they keep saying is that uh

1032
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,440
Well nobody's found Saddam Hussein yet but that doesn't mean he doesn't exist

1033
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,080
Well they

1034
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,120
But one guy

1035
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,620
They're saying these documents were all forged and then they're saying no they're not

1036
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,260
And then they say well here's the proof they're all forged and they go no they're not

1037
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,320
So what kind of world is that that I'm living in right now can you help me out

1038
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,960
The bigger the lie

1039
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,220
The kind of world

1040
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,680
The better the pill goes down

1041
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,020
The better the pill goes down

1042
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,780
I'm not sure they'll be a black van waiting for us downstairs

1043
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,360
Well not today

1044
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,740
Well not today

1045
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,300
But maybe tomorrow

1046
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,140
Yeah we keep waiting

1047
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,220
And they haven't

1048
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:54,360
All they've done is tap our phones and photograph us and and they've been bored they've been frankly bored

1049
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:00,080
Oh there's a little masturbate again for Christ's sake this guy won't quit I don't know what his problem is

1050
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,620
I thought they were gonna be making vines

1051
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,720
I passed you my coffee over there did you eat my donut Jesus Christ

1052
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,060
Yeah

1053
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,460
They're all in the van outside of our houses

1054
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,180
Going

1055
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,620
Oh my God all they do is talk about monster movies and crap

1056
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,080
I thought there was gonna be bombs

1057
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,820
Wish they could smoke

1058
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,820
Yeah they talk about girls and and and the gossip

1059
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,180
Oh didn't you hear the donuts were poison they made everybody sick

00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,060
Yeah they made them sick alright they made them sick where it counts

1061
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,180
In the first and second third and fourth degrees

1062
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,640
No those were the

1063
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,220
High trees

1064
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,860
Real detectives

1065
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,500
And real donuts too

1066
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,160
Real donuts real detectives

1067
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,400
Real cherrypie

1068
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,640
At the sign of the falling tree

1069
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,520
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland

1070
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,880
I'm almost gonna die

1071
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,220
When it's time for me to die

1072
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm almost gonna die

1073
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,100
I'm almost gonna die

1074
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,480
I'm almost gonna die

1075
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,720
I'm almost gonna die

1076
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:55,900
I'm almost gonna die

1077
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,860
When it's time for me to die

1078
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,080
I don't wanna live my life the way I want to

1079
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,200
For real cause it's your pain when you feel it

1080
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,480
It is your blood when you bleed

1081
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,940
It is your loss when you lose

1082
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,980
Agree or disagree

1083
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,900
That's why when you talk it

1084
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,000
Is through your own teeth

1085
