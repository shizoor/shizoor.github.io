00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,540

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,060

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,000

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,360

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:22,780

11
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,800
as it says

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,020
you

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:39,520
the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up with wine

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,980
they're out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment

15
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,780
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness and there is no

16
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,200
place clean

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,160
yes

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,260
shut that baby up in there

19
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,840
babies they get into all the subgenius shows not just in texas

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,900
my equilibrium

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,460
destabilized

22
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,040
uh

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,600
uh

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,700
yes

25
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:54,780


26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:24,780


27
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:24,780


28
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,440
so we're doing everything in our power to put a stop to the recent false subgenius fad of gut blowout parties

29
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:50,500
there went one just then these reckless kids are risking their souls taking these green joy jackers and bowel lifters and screamers and laughers and floppers and floaters and all those other unsanctified street drugs this is false slack friends

30
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620
there's only

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,400
one

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
nine

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,760
ten

34
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:54,840
we're

35
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,080
oh

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,000
here goes there's a gut blowout party friends

37
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,420
listen to that in the background that was the latest doc stock

38
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,520
this is the doctors preparing the prescriptions

39
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,100
there's only one of these mind relinquishing substances that you should even consider putting the gobble on

40
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,240
and that's the sacred tibetan herb

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,480
haba

42
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,620
ziplops

43
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
which is not a drug

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,760
now you know if you don't have to take the frop you can quit if you want to go sane if you want to keep your mouth shut

45
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:32,420
your so-called senses, but how can we know the goddess of heaven seen on the slide, lest

46
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,300
we have, for comparison, vomited into the porcelain bowls of hell? For, although the

47
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,300
great inebriant of Tibet provides only an illusory vision of time control, yet such

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,840
a glimpse fortifies the subgenius, and he follows the taste of that artificial slack,

49
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:59,260
drooling like a dog in rut. He is a dauntless explorer of fake horizons, for, of all the

50
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,300
sacraments, frop does not wear off.

51
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,780
Ha ha ha ha ha.

53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,080
What's wrong with you? We like you and should ignore you, but instead...

54
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Ah!

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,820
Well, I'm...

56
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:20,820


57
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:29,680
I went on down to my girlfriend's shack to see how they did hang. When I got there,

58
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:39,080
her cupboard was bare. I couldn't ignite a thing. There was no shard, no bone, no twig.

59
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,160
I brought my comic book collection.

60
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,180
What's about this big, yeah?

61
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,220
Well, frop without slack is like slack without frop. But where the hell else am I going to

62
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,620
cop?

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,340
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock, but all that food was stale. I thought

64
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:09,860
I'd call that rip-off schmuck, but I forgot he was in jail. Ended up killing a porcupine

65
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,480
just to see if I could smoke his rind. Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

66
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,820
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

67
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah!

68
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah!

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,300
Frop without slack is like slack without frop. But where the hell else am I going to

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,660
cop?

71
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:36,320
I don't know what I am going to do, I just know that this here trip ain't a room

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,720
Oh!

73
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,660
Frop without slack is like slack without frop. But where the hell else am I going to

74
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,080
cop?

75
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh!

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,920
Frop without slack is like slack without frop.

77
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,800
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,780
Don't cop from that guy there.

79
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,300
Oh, stay away from that.

80
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
Uh-huh.

81
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,500
No way.

82
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,940
Is that Frop?

83
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,720
This is Habifrop Zip-Di-Lops, too.

84
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,780
You can smell it.

85
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
It doesn't smell like marijuana at all.

86
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,020
It's got a very pungent odor.

87
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,720
I don't like this stuff.

88
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,560
It is free.

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
We have to smoke it.

90
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,560
It's one of the rules.

91
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,180
We're talking about a barrel of Habifrop.

92
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,980
We're talking about a void,

93
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,020
a limitless void of Habifrop.

94
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,380
Right.

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,080
We're talking about several alternate realities.

96
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,980
We're talking about your basic...

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,660
We're talking about putting it in your pipe and smoking it.

98
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,900
And another thing I want to tell you about tonight,

99
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,000
we've had some calamities

100
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,200
and some calamitous times in Malaysia.

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,160
You might have heard about all the rains we had.

102
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,620
Yes, dear friends,

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,440
it was flooding over here,

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
but, oh, Bob,

105
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,140
oh, good old Bob knew that when it flooded in Malaysia,

106
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,660
you better build your houses on stilts.

107
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,720
So all our houses are built on stilts over here, dear friends.

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,340
Ha-ha.

109
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,640
We knew a long time ago

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,500
that when those floodwaters came,

111
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,360
we better be sitting pretty,

112
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,480
sitting high,

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,400
so nobody can come by.

114
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
And speaking of...

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,560
sitting high,

116
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,660
we need something over here in Malaysia.

117
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,540
Yes, our whole drug cabinet was washed away.

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,100
And after a flood, you know,

119
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,660
we need some drugs.

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,600
We need some drugs that can help the people out here.

121
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,680
So what I want you all to do, dear friends, is...

122
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,060
Bob.

123
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,340
Bob.

124
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,860
Bob.

125
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,420
Bob.

126
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,840
Bob.

127
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,500
Bob loved you.

128
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,120
Bob.

129
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,460
Bob.

130
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,920
Bob.

131
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,380
Bob.

132
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,780
Bob.

133
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,560
Bob loved you.

134
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Bob loved you.

135
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,900
Bob loved you.

136
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,840
Bob loved you.

137
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
Bob loved you.

138
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:46,860


139
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,100


140
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,340


141
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,540
Bob loved you.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,620
Move.

143
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,960
Move.

144
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,500
Move.

145
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,340
Theita Mehran.

146
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,080
So Scott,

147
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,880
Brian,

148
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Scott Benny

149
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,440


150
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:12,280
are trying to figure out how they are doing in their worlds but use music to cause people who tell them to exist to be needed even if they aren't. So check that out!

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,860
Get people involved.

152
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:17,980


153
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:17,980


154
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:17,980


155
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:17,980


156
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:34,300
You know, I was walking down the beach, trying to get to my Woody, where I had my suds cold

157
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,440
and my buds of gold.

158
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,400
I was going to get high and get real drunk.

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Lay in the sand with my beach buddy.

160
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,820
With my beach buddy.

161
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:56,060
But out of the side of my eye, I saw the ultimate wave.

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,620
The super wave.

163
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,280
It was the most stoked out stud wave in all reality.

164
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,400
It was 900 feet tall.

165
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,800
And on the backside of reality, too.

166
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,320
I saw a black hole right in the middle of it.

167
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,560
A vortex.

168
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm ready to shoot through that black hole.

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,620
Have my molecules rearranged.

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm going to hang five as I shoot through the black hole of the vortex of the super wave.

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,820
The most god awful wave in reality.

172
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,120
On the backside of reality.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,860
The front side and the left and the right side.

174
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,180
Woo!

175
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,620
Woo!

176
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,880
Woo!

177
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,540
Woo!

178
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


179
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


180
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


181
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


182
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


183
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


185
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


186
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


187
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


188
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


189
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


190
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


191
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


192
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


193
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


194
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,540


195
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,740
Woo!

196
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,340
Woo!

197
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,160
Woo!

198
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,160


199
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,160


200
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,520
I was tubing.

201
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,320
Woo!

202
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,260
Woo!

203
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,460


204
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,020
I was fixing to cut out.

205
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,680
And!

206
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:58,860


207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,180
And then!

208
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,060
Woo!

209
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,580
And then!

210
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
300.

211
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,760
Woo!

212
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
This is what you would call it.

213
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,760
This is one of those what you would call it.

214
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,340
It just opened up right out in the sea.

215
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,040
Big old man, I was just starting to suck me down.

216
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,900
It's like a vortex funnel sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean.

217
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
I was getting sucked down.

218
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,080
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it,

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,740
it felt pretty good.

220
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,360
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

222
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,620
But God, I hate to admit it.

223
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,760
But God, I hate to admit it.

224
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,520
It felt pretty good.

225
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,380
But I hate to admit it.

226
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,400
Moving on down the backside of reality.

227
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,220
My bad words, my bad sign.

228
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,920
Drive the wave and stoke it on my fine day.

229
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,820
Moving on down to the back of reality.

230
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Riding on my bad words, stoking on my fine day.

231
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:47,760
Riding on my bad words, stoking on my fine day.

232
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,300
Riding on my bad words, stoking on my fine day.

233
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Riding on my bad words, stoking on my fine day.

234
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,560
Mojo can really play the drums.

235
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,540
He was stuck down in this group thing.

236
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,920
He was laying down on the backside of reality on those tracks.

237
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,680
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?

238
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,680
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

239
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,960
We play it every week.

240
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,340
It was back in our acid days.

241
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,560
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

242
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,900
Yes, I know that.

243
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,100
The Swingin' Love Horses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

244
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
Yeah, we don't really like the rag.

245
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,740
We don't talk about it.

246
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,400
We don't talk about it.

247
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,920
We don't really advocate it.

248
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
We did expand our consciousness.

249
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,780
But I thought that you condoned contracted consciousness.

250
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,460
We condone contracted consciousness.

251
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,520
Consciousness.

252
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,520


253
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,620
Expanded consciousness.

254
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,080
Consciousness.

255
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,520
Consciousness.

256
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,820
Well, so some of your music actually has been LSD influenced.

257
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,100
Right.

258
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,140
And that is...

259
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,800
What is the similarity here?

260
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,440
I'm reminded of the 60s garage bands.

261
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,540
That's like LSD.

262
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,180
Lollipop sugar donuts.

263
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,800
LSD lollipop.

264
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,820
Luxury mountains appearing from the sky.

265
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,600
We got high on high doses of sugar.

266
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,720
That's what it was.

267
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,540
White sugar.

268
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,400
And we called it LSD just to cut a joke.

269
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,580
And you would have visions and get into the backside of reality.

270
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,440
You would actually drive...

271
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
You would drive the curl into the back, into the vortex.

272
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,500
Right.

273
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,280
It's like the molecules...

274
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,420
Oh, this is my favorite.

275
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,800
This is beautiful.

276
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,060
These vicious junkies and...

277
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,400
LSD.

278
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,120
LSD.

279
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,060
LSD.

280
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,080
LSD.

281
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,820
LSD.

282
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:33,940


283
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,060


284
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,140


285
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,320


286
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,760
LSD.

287
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,060
LSD.

288
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,060


289
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,060


290
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,060


291
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,400
LSD.

292
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,620
LSD.

293
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,500
LSD.

294
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,620


295
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,620


296
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,760
LSD.

297
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,780
LSD.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,040
LSD.

299
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,480
LSD.

300
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,040


301
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,040


302
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,040


303
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,040


304
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,040


305
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


306
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


307
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,420
LSD.

308
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


309
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


310
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


311
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


312
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


313
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


314
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


315
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


316
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,420


317
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:06,260
Or it's outside the church in the street that one truly feels the touch.

318
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,380
They're drinking the real blood of Jesus, friends, or the blood of Bob or whoever,

319
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,140
out of those green Thunderbird bottles.

320
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,740
LSD.

321
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,800


322
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,800


323
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,800


324
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,420
LSD was not beaten up in very hard times.

325
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,420


326
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,420


327
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,420


328
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,040
His blood became the muscatel, the mad dog, the night train that those boys ride.

329
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,400
It does what religion is supposed to do.

330
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
It makes them feel so good.

331
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Ah, yes.

332
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:53,260
It is the pink, suburban, respectable alcoholic who has no excuse and, verily, no hope.

333
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,160
Well, perhaps there is one thing that can bring them from their closet of opiated, self-hating secrecy.

334
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,060
Perhaps, if they turned to the force.

335
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
The Habifrop Lords of Tibet.

336
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:15,820
Yes, we most pious arch-popes condone, violently, the most frequent possible indulgence unto intoxication and beyond

337
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:25,600
of the revered and despised grief-easer of the mountains, the warrior against pain, the healing herb, Habifrop Zipulops.

338
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,900
Whether taken as smoke, liquid food, or as bobs, pills, trademark,

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,060
it, above all the other medicinal herbs,

340
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,060
or as medicinal substances, spells relief.

341
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,440
From the hearty young stalks protruding from the Himalayan snow to the white frot dust that settles on the rim of Bob's pipe,

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,620
it's the closest thing to the untainted essence of Odin on earth.

343
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,780
How else can we regard that which produces in the devoted user such superhuman clarity of insight,

344
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,340
such sensory hyper-anesthesia, such total loss of judgment,

345
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,060
which yet is profound?

346
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,100
Such profound wisdom, such placid ecstasy and blessed repose,

347
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,560
which, in short, is the only shortcut to the realization of the Dob's state.

348
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,660
The Exists planted our beloved Frop on earth near the close of the age of dinosaurs.

349
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,540
Bob tells us it may well be Jehovah One's main instrument for evolution on this planet,

350
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,080
having very possibly been the device which brought down the great reptiles,

351
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,260
allowing us mammals to take their place as large destroyers.

352
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,760
And yet, also, Frop is that which will, with Bob's guidance,

353
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,880
likewise complete the usurpation as dominant species of the humans by the subgenius hordes.

354
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Frop's detractors, mostly alcoholics and potheads, scream that it is a physically addictive vampire root

355
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,660
from whose siren embrace no man can tug free.

356
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,380
We shout, Hallelujah!

357
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,300
Praise Bob, of course it is!

358
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,180
And is the Lord himself one bit less habit-forming?

359
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,060
Habit-Frop-Zip-Yelops teaches us, ultimately, that all is one, that up is down.

360
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,880
It allows us to converse with trees,

361
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,100
and to see prophetic and accurate visions of the future in our shoes,

362
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,780
our album covers,

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
in the strange reflections on our toasters.

364
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,700
An ascetic Frop-master in Tibet or Dob's town

365
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,620
can, with diligent consumption,

366
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,020
finally lose all interest in everything,

367
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,520
achieving the paranervanic state closest to Bob himself.

368
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,100
The Paranormal Life of Bob

369
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:51,400
The Paranormal Life of Bob

370
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
The Paranormal Life of Bob

371
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,260
In Heaven, everything is fine

372
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:14,680
In Heaven, everything is fine

373
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,840
In Heaven, everything is fine

374
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:29,500
You got your good things, I got mine

375
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:40,340
In Heaven, everything is fine

376
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,700
In Heaven, everything is fine

377
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,740
You got your good things, I got mine

378
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,740
My equilibrium, destabilized!

379
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,280
As a young man, I was full of life and imagination and ideas.

380
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,980
Now I know it's all just an illusion.

381
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,700
And you, oh, you think your mission is so very important.

382
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,380
To me, it means nothing.

383
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,880
I really don't care if you win or lose.

384
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,100
It's what our free society is founded on.

385
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,540
You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?

386
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,060
I said, do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?

387
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,960
They don't pay bills in Russia, it's all free.

388
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,340
Huh?

389
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,620
Oh, you know commies?

390
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,460
Oh, you better not be.

391
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,820
I don't want no commies in my cart.

392
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,240
No Christians either.

393
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,500
A lot of people don't realize what's really going on.

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,460
They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things.

395
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,200
They don't realize that theirs is like

396
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,740
a lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything.

397
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I'll give you an example.

398
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll show you what I mean.

399
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,600
Suppose you're thinking about a plate of shrimp.

400
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,800
Suddenly somebody will say like, plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp.

401
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,060
Out of the blue, no explanation.

402
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,660
No point in looking for one either.

403
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,420
It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.

404
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,820
You read a lot of acid, Miller, back in the hippie days?

405
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,780
I'll give you another instance.

406
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,620
You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now?

407
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,260
Books in all the supermarkets about commuter triangles, UFOs,

408
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,920
how the Mayans invented television, that kind of thing.

409
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,280
I don't read them books.

410
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,480
Well, the way I see it, it's exactly the same.

411
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,780
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine.

412
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,220
People get so hung up on specifics, they miss out on seeing the whole thing.

413
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,740
Take South America, for example.

414
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,100
In South America, thousands of people go missing every year.

415
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
Nobody knows where they go.

416
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Just like disappear.

417
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,360
But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something.

418
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
There had to be a time when there was no people, right?

419
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,500
Yeah, I guess.

420
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,720
Well, where did all these people come from?

421
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,580
I'll tell you where.

422
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,200
The future.

423
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,960
Where did all these people disappear to?

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,700
The past.

425
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,540
That's right.

426
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,100
And how'd they get there?

427
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,700
Flying saucers.

428
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
Which are really...

429
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, you got it.

430
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,620
Time machines.

431
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,260
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

432
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,500
I do my best thinking on the bus.

433
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,880
That's how come I don't drive, see?

434
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,320
You don't even know how to drive.

435
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,820
I don't want to know how.

436
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,060
I don't want to learn, see?

437
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,580
The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.

438
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,040
Not necessarily beautiful, but beautiful.

439
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,160
A letter from a prisoner.

440
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,240
A prisoner?

441
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,460
A prisoner in Atlanta.

442
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,300
Oh, yeah.

443
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


444
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


445
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


446
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


447
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


448
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


449
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


450
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


451
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


452
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


453
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


454
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


455
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


456
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


457
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


458
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


459
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


460
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


461
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


462
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,300


463
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,080
Or near to Atlanta.

464
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,960
Actually, his prison address here is in Delaware.

465
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,620
What's he in prison for?

466
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,460
What we have here.

467
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,040
Listen to this letter.

468
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,920
Oh, and he's...

469
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,280
He's on phase U to foldicate.

470
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,660
I mean, communicate.

471
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,020
This was sent to us here in Cleveland, not to the Dallas headquarters.

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,640
He goes,

473
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,200
Almighty Holy Messenger, my name is Noah Hughes, AKA Pope Nasty.

474
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,040
Noah Count.

475
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm a devout subgenius whose rights to slack are being withheld through a local department.

476
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,480
I'm currently being held in Gander Hill Prison, located in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges

477
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,880
of...

478
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,260
Hey, you got that rack of dollars.

479
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,860
Sell it.

480
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,140
Hey.

481
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,940
Prop possession.

482
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,080
I'm looking at about three more years, and they repeatedly had church material refused

483
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,840
for no other reason than it's the conspiracy.

484
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm asking you to please send any church information or prayer material.

485
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,720
Prisoners always want it free.

486
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,260
They want it free.

487
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,520
I'm asking you to please send any information as well as documentation of any kind to show

488
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,100
that our glorious church is recognized by the government as an actual religion.

489
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,420
Well, it's not.

490
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm...

491
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,040
Which is too bad for all those people I've married.

492
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm working on building a case against the prison for isolation of my First Amendment

493
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,300
rights, a violation of them.

494
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,760
So please feel free to forward any and all information pertaining to these topics and

495
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,140
requests.

496
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,400
My body is totally slack-free.

497
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,260
And I'm hurting for some of your old-time religion.

498
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,980
Also, please use the church name on the return address so I can receive said slack.

499
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,540
God bless you, my fine friend.

500
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,040
Give me slack.

501
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,980
Praise...

502
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh, that poor man.

503
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,200
Now to discuss his actual agonizing condition.

504
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,100
Just think at what he must go through every day.

505
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,400
He bangs a tin cup against the cell door.

506
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,120
A guy with one of those 1930s King Kong hats comes up and says,

507
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


508
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


509
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


510
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


511
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


512
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


513
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


514
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


515
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


516
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


517
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


518
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


519
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


520
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,400
He's a spy.

521
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,020
And pulls out his old billy stick and starts clubbing him ferociously until the guy next

522
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:47,460
door, who is somewhere near 455 pounds of solid muscle with a shaved head, has barbecue

523
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,640
shavings with him.

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,700
Eww.

525
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,020
That is so disgusting.

526
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,660
And for what?

527
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,680
What did this man do to deserve this?

528
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,580
Lick a black hole of liquor.

529
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,460
All this man did was lick a black hole.

530
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,540
That's all he did.

531
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,020
And did that hurt anybody?

532
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,100
I don't know.

533
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,100


534
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,100


535
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,420
Did it hurt anybody else?

536
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,020
No.

537
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,100
Well, no, my friend.

538
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,020
You don't understand.

539
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,660
The reason why we are against drugs is because they are against us.

540
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,460
Don't you understand what it is saying?

541
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,800
But yet you can buy heroin down at the supermarket.

542
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,780
I mean beer.

543
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,680
You can buy false hair anywhere, pal.

544
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,560
That doesn't mean you're not going to stay bald.

545
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,140
You can get crack down at the liquor store.

546
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,080
I mean whiskey.

547
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,800
You know, I mean you can get, you can get narcotics anywhere.

548
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
You could be a narcotic.

549
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,940
All this man did was have some froth and lick a black hole.

550
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,080
He should have told the judge.

551
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,480
He should have told the judge.

552
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,220
I am drugs like some more dollars do.

553
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,400
He's probably been staring.

554
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,820
He's probably got three more years of looking in the black hole.

555
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,260
I guess they better put, I bet they better put God in prison for growing froth.

556
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,280
The last time I heard, Mr. God was growing marijuana and froth.

557
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,900
Both.

558
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,880
By the roadside, my friend.

559
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,840
All over this country and many others.

560
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,140
I guess they better put God in that Dander Hill prison.

561
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,140
That God is in jail right now, Stan.

562
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,460
That's, well, that's good.

563
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,200
That's kind of one of the main problems or why we are having so many problems right now.

564
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,200
Well, they're lowering the coffin of God into the ground.

565
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,660
God can't get out.

566
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,900
God is dead.

567
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,000
God is not in, he's not dead.

568
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,120
He's doing 15 to 25 at a, at a minimum.

569
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,380
Well, not really a minimum.

570
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,240
There is barbed wire, but he can't get out.

571
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,960
For growing.

572
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,180
God's in prison for growing.

573
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,880
Well, no, actually just for, for consorting with an angular object.

574
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,320
I think there were even more of a curse than that.

575
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,460
I think they're, I think they're working on getting the, throwing the sun.

576
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,460


577
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,460


578
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,960
The sun in the hoose gal too.

579
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,580
I thought God was arrested by the fourth dimensional sheriff.

580
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,340
Fourth dimensional sheriff.

581
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,720
For trying to break into the fifth dimension.

582
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,700
Yeah, cause we've got only a three dimensional God.

583
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Yeah.

584
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,480
He was getting so bad for his brick.

585
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,180
Oh, he was doing.

586
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,200
Well, actually maybe it's, maybe God's just a four dimensional critter and every now and

587
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,080
then you just see a wavering light in the air and you hear a voice.

588
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,760
So everybody goes, God.

589
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,440
So maybe you're saying God got thrown in jail for doing that.

590
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,560
No, God, he's just an adventurer.

591
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,740
He's like a guy who, he lives in the four dimensional world.

592
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,080
It lives in the four dimensional land.

593
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,060
Uh, but uh, he's just out tooling around one day and stuck his head in on earth, you know?

594
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,740
Oh man.

595
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,500
What a mistake.

596
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,800
It's like us looking through a microscope at a bunch of microbes.

597
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,920
He looked around at the people and he was just like, you know, dude's like, you shouldn't

598
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,220
kill.

599
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,960
Like don't do that.

600
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,340
And he kind of stuck his finger out when he said that, but you know, that's what came

601
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:33,420
up.

602
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


603
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


604
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


605
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


606
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


607
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


608
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


609
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


610
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,420


611
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,900
He was just going through the, to three dimensions when he stuck his finger out, he kind of like

612
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,980
passed through and they said, and he said, do not kill him.

613
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,060
They wrote it on a stone.

614
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,080
They all said, kill him, kill him.

615
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,900
And then they realized every time they killed him, he kept on coming back every Easter.

616
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,240
So they put his ass in jail and they're not letting him out.

617
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,020
Aren't you mixing up God with Jesus, Dave?

618
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,080
Oh, the idea.

619
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,100
That's his little boy, God, Jr.

620
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,180
I'm, I beg to differ with myself.

621
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,420
God is not only his only purified self, but he's also his son.

622
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,420


623
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,700
He's also an alien vestigal.

624
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,980
He's three in one, three great candies in one.

625
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,040
And may he rest in peace.

626
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,500
Yeah.

627
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,860
Or may he get some slack time in the yards, you know, without.

628
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,880
Yeah.

629
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,960
Cause not only did he grow the froth, but he grew the humans and put, gave them these

630
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,720
brains whereby they would figure out that if they chewed on the froth and packed it

631
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,480
up their eggs, it would have felt kind of good.

632
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,080
And so they did it because they could.

633
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,820
Now I think God should be thrown in jail for that.

634
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,260
I think so.

635
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,300
I think jail should probably be his most, his most divine wish.

636
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,900
Cause somewhere there's a 15 year old smoking pot and God's God's responsibility.

637
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,320
He brought it around.

638
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
He's that kid's father.

639
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,500
We're all children of God.

640
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,340
Wildwood weed.

641
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,420
If, if man.

642
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,640
What if God actually did look like divine though?

643
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,340
I mean, wouldn't that be a stunning surprise to walk into the heavenly gates and there's

644
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,800
St. Peter and he's all bespectacled and he looks like he's got, you know, like a foreskin

645
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,620
around his neck.

646
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:01,780
Yeah.

647
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,020
That's how God will look to Jesse Helms.

648
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,380
With a foreskin around his neck.

649
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,620
Right.

650
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,320
And a biting, angry one eyed head.

651
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,560
That's, that's the way Jesse Helms will die.

652
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,500
God will look like the young kitten Nativi Dodd in an early Russ Meyer film.

653
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,020
Kitten Nativi Dodd.

654
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,700
Oh God's boy's in the White House now.

655
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,140
So we should be seeing a lot more of this.

656
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,960
Bob's boy.

657
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,700
Well, that's the two dimensional God I think you're talking about.

658
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:27,820


659
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,920
This morning they, uh, uh, yeah.

660
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,920
This morning they found the Bush daughters passed out in their own puke on the front

661
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520
lawn of the White House.

662
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,660
That could be a well, that could be true, couldn't it?

663
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,900
It is.

664
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,660
It is.

665
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,700
It is a true thing.

666
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,040
Yeah.

667
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,120
You know how you can lie to me.

668
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,880
They were passed out on the lawn in their own puke.

669
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,960
I, that was when I quit.

670
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,320
That was my last drink.

671
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,860
That was the problem.

672
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,460
I woke up on the White House lawn in a puddle of my own puke.

673
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,780
Wearing that duck suit and a brassiere.

674
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,900
And I can tell I had scratched deep galley.

675
00:30:59,900 --> 00:30:59,900


676
00:30:59,900 --> 00:30:59,900


677
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,540
I had my lounges in the door with my fingernail the night before.

678
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,540
And you realized one tooth was missing and they were like, you were wearing lipstick.

679
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,800
I was, I realized that I better quit drinking.

680
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,700
But you know, those secret service guys never did quit because they, there's still guys

681
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,860
scratching at the door.

682
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,480
Those guys don't buy liquor for young broads.

683
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,520
Everybody's drinking on the job.

684
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,800
Uncle Gregg seedicubes.

685
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:44,660
Mm hmm.

686
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,440
Tududele son of a N.

687
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,260
Trop without slack dear friends.

688
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,600
The users of drugs, drugs, dear friends on the other hand are placing themselves in grave

689
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,280
danger.

690
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,980
They can never get as truly fried as they want to be.

691
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,760
They've got to take one on top of the other.

692
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,220
Sometimes they take so many that when they forget one or two, they later get mad at themselves for it.

693
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,320
So to keep mentally levitating, they always need more.

694
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,100
Sooner or later, they burn out and become too slacked to react.

695
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:30,700
As they say, the brain tunnels through which they once excavated and blasted with such drunken zeal begin to cave in.

696
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,260
The abuser wakes up one day impaired.

697
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,180
His muscles feel ravaged, his nerves nullified.

698
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,920
There is a hollowness inside, but a hot hollowness.

699
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:49,020
And discomfort mounts to panic as he realizes he's annihilated one brain cell too many.

700
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,880
His teeth grind.

701
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,120
His cells shrivel yet seem to scream for more when there is none.

702
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:03,060
His skin exudes bitter greases from every pore as if he were getting a long overdue oil change.

703
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,920
Everything's clammy and numb to the touch.

704
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:12,960
His eternal itch gasps and convulses with the amputation nausea of something missing.

705
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,320
The electric glue of his brain becomes tacky and stiffens.

706
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,080
The snot-like shock fluid in which the brain wants to escape.

707
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,100


708
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:42,640
The floor lurches and shifts its steepness and changes its slant right under his feet.

709
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:50,360
If he lays down, he suffers the slow ovals, the bed seeming to spin very slowly end over end through space.

710
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:59,220
He goes to the bathroom to expel the bad water, but his urine smells burnt and leaks out in a weak radioactive dribble.

711
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:11,160
He looks in the mirror. His skin is Krishna blue in pallor, and he worries that the quiet interior shattering noises he hears are the sounds of his blood crystallizing.

712
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:25,360
His heart starts to dry hump the back of his throat in hysteria, for he knows that to die on drugs is to doom his soul to eternal earthbound wandering in a purgatory where the liquor stores are all closed.

713
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:35,460
If the mental eye is intoxicated, the very soul is intoxicated when the body dies, it doesn't know it's dead and so never heads for heaven.

714
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,140
Laying on the floor, glowing feebly in the dark, the wretch moans,

715
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,000
out the drug user's lament,

716
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:50,880
I can't decipher anything. Put me where you want me. Give me rubber blankets.

717
00:34:51,760 --> 00:35:02,060
Eventually his cohorts show up and give him sucor in the form of more, and the wheel starts rolling again.

718
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,140
The conspiracy encourages, blatantly, a useless empty box.

719
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,040
The reality is that the reality is a pattern of social drug abuse in its slaves.

720
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:22,900
The anti-reality sleep drugs like alcohol and downers are legal pretty much, while the wake-up drugs are only available.

721
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,680
You can tell which ones they'd rather you take.

722
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Hey, guys?

723
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Yeah, yeah, over there.

724
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah.

725
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,480
Yeah.

726
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,740
I just got a question for you.

727
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,700
I saw you smoking and I was just wondering,

728
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,460
that ain't F.R.O.P. now, is it?

729
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,300
It is?

730
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,860
Oh, hot damn!

731
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,440
Man, man, this is something.

732
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,820
I've never seen F.R.O.P. before.

733
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,540
Yeah, I mean, never tried it or anything, you know.

734
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,800
Of course, I'd really like to try it, you know.

735
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,900
You know, just a little bit, just to see what it's like, you know.

736
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:26,940
Maybe compare it to something like, you know, marijuana or tobacco or banana peels, you know, whatever, you know.

737
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,720
But, you know, just take a little bit, you know.

738
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,440
Not a whole lot or anything like that, you know.

739
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,380
Just enough to...

740
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,520
Just enough to...

741
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,860
Give me a hit, you know.

742
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,280
You know, not enough to fill up my lungs or anything, you know.

743
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,700
Just...

744
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,720
For me?

745
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,360
I can try it?

746
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,900
Really?

747
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,580
Ha!

748
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,800
Oh, wow, man.

749
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
That's, uh...

750
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,240
That's really generous of you, man.

751
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,180
I...

752
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,780
Uh...

753
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,040
I think I will.

754
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,520
Thank you.

755
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,040
Um...

756
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,560
Okay.

757
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,140
All right, I'm gonna do it now.

758
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm gonna do it.

759
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,240
Uh...

760
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh, man.

761
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,080
I'm just really nervous here, you know.

762
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,840
I've never tried F.R.O.P. before, you know.

763
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,040
I don't know what it's gonna do or anything, you know.

764
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,840
You know, okay.

765
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,080
All right.

766
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,380
I'm really gonna try it now.

767
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,020
Um...

768
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,660
Um...

769
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,540
It's not lit.

770
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,220
Oh, okay.

771
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


772
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


773
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


774
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


775
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


776
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


777
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


778
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


779
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


780
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


781
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


782
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,900
Oh, it makes its own fumes.

783
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,260
Okay.

784
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,880
All right.

785
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,140
You know, you don't have to light it for anything.

786
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,560
No?

787
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,180
You just...

788
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,240
You just suck on it.

789
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,280
All right.

790
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,020
All right.

791
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay.

792
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,860
We'll give this one a try, then.

793
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,100
All right.

794
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,420
Here goes nothing.

795
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,100
All right.

796
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
I'm gonna do it.

797
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,800
Mm...

798
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,540
Oh, my God.

799
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,320
Oh, my God.

800
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,060
Oh, my God.

801
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,200
Oh, my God.

802
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


803
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


804
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


805
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


806
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


807
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


808
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


809
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,200


810
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,660
Oh, my God.

811
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,840
Oh, my God.

812
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,220
Oh, my God.

813
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,420
Oh, my God.

814
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,420


815
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,320
This is it.

816
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,100
Oh, my God.

817
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,980
Oh, my God.

818
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,120
You're sick,Í

819
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,120


820
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,120


821
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,420
Okay.

822
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:33,420


823
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:33,420


824
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:33,420


825
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,540


826
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,540


827
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,540


828
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:33,760


829
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh, boy.

830
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,180
08202 dak2

831
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,680
isto

832
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,840
I don't know.

833
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,060
I don't know.

834
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,760
I don't know.

835
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,220
Damn, that stuff got on top of me.

836
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,320
It got right on top of me, man.

837
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,020
Uh, can I have some more?

838
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,640
You know, just a little bit, you know.

839
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,400
Not anything really major or anything.

840
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,520
Just a little thing.

841
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,340
Oh, my God.

842
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,820
With Frop, Bob gives his most insanely courageous warriors,

843
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,740
the Brotherhood of Bob, brief glimpses of the before life,

844
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,060
the pleasure dimension foretold by the prophet Janer.

845
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,820
And it fortifies them in their acts of terminal mercy.

846
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,720
It steals the nerves and frees the wills of his chosen instruments of death and eternal slack.

847
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,860
Slack Squad missionary Poonflang Damarung spoke lovingly of it

848
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,720
in Economicon 714 before his immortal last mission

849
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,960
in a testimonial to his Lord Bob's ways.

850
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,180
Yes, Poonflang said, Bob shares of his own pipe with us

851
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,840
before each foray into the belly of the beast.

852
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:29,900
It gives us the knowledge of our true will and how it is juxtaposed with Bob's.

853
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,560
We all grip each other by the shoulders and sidle together in a great circle

854
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,600
as we chant together between the holy dosages.

855
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,860
The dizzying Frop fumes combine with the endless rhythmical repetitions

856
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,580
to create a living vortex power of unspeakable ecstasy.

857
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Kill, kill for the love of killing.

858
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,800
Kill for the love of Kali.

859
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,040
Kill, kill for fun.

860
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,920
Kill to be free.

861
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,940
Kill like a man to make America great.

862
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,300
While alcohol wantonly destroys brain tissue,

863
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,060
sloughing it off to be passed in the morning as the wasted dead ravages of wine,

864
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:06,860
wine?

865
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,380
Frop?

866
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,820
Not kill brain cells, nay nay!

867
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,400
But mutates them.

868
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,760
Causes them to multiply faster.

869
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Each succeeding generation is, of course, stronger than those before it.

870
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,500
Man made booze.

871
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,120
Bob made Frop.

872
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,520
Who do you trust?

873
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,560
Frop enables one to see with the eyes closed.

874
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,000
This is known as the unblinking stare of the overlid.

875
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,160
Through it, one may pass through the gates,

876
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
and the

877
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,040
world is filled with the unblinking stare of the unblinking.

878
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,840
The Frop has reached Bardo 18 of the 18th hole of Hangar 18 of Zombo Fropland.

879
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,260
He may think the same thought over and over and over and over and over,

880
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,800
and yet never care, never feel boredom.

881
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,160
The Frop entered through the forehead and exited through the upper back of the neck.

882
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,640
The possessing demon was exercised instantly,

883
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,700
and the president, if not his brain or the governor's, was saved.

884
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,660
This, my friends, is Frop.

885
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,320
But whether you're a Frop head or not,

886
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,160
the true subgenius forces the body to stand upright,

887
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,400
where it can see further.

888
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,600
He shows authority over the drug fiend which houses the brain.

889
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,180
Our rightful place has been usurped by our own bodies,

890
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,140
and we want to see the man who has the power to do it.

891
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


892
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


893
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


894
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


895
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


896
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,140


897
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,860
The man in charge, and it's Bob.

898
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,420
Bob is the true mind storm, my friends.

899
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,120
The godly lobe explosion in your skull.

900
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,780
Who needs dope?

901
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,700
You never come down from the high of Bob.

902
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,680
Bob is the drug, friends.

903
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,180
The conspiracy is the real drug that drugs you,

904
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,100
that makes you want to go to sleep or to kick ass for no reason.

905
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,620
Bob is the drug that makes you kick ass where it counts.

906
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,040
The drug of remembering who you are.

907
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,460
The drug that wakes you up.

908
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,500
The drug that makes you see or leaves you be.

909
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,640
Praise Bob!

910
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,660
It's hope or force or method,

911
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,840
being too smart to swing in mood.

912
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,700
While rats run up my trouser legs,

913
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,320
roaches share my food.

914
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,100
Rats and roaches,

915
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,600
now's the time to go to sleep.

916
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,600


917
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,600


918
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,600


919
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,600


920
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,600


921
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,760
Because I'll be when it's dark and hot.

922
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,220
Love, love,

923
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,560
it's all the same,

924
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,120
mixing speed and part.

925
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,920
First a rat and then a roach,

926
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,400
or both, as like as not.

927
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,060
If I can't find a fix tonight,

928
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,040
my marrow bones will rot.

929
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,620
Goodbye, transcendent

930
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,380
pumpkin square,

931
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,240
I haven't long to stay.

932
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,840
A double jolt of heroin

933
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,800
and I'll be on my way.

934
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,100
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

935
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,600
Getting some

936
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,180
stoned on sunshine,

937
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,300
getting high on air.

938
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,020
Getting to it naturally,

939
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,240
really getting there.

940
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,260
Getting such a high on,

941
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,480
loving what I do.

942
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,620
I'm so full of happiness,

943
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,460
hooked on something new.

944
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,420
Life is such a

945
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,840
trippy thing,

946
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,200
hell over these

947
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,460
hell of springs.

948
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,360
Each day on earth

949
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,160
is a day that's worth

950
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,140
remembering.

951
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
And I mean

952
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,180
just what I say.

953
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,460
Life is such a

954
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,800
groovy thing.

955
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,460
Don't pity me,

956
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,300
I'm glad to be

957
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,860
a ding-a-ling.

958
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,820
What's up, what's up,

959
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
how are you? How are you?

960
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,200
I'm serious.

961
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,200
I'm serious.

962
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,980
Well, now you have

963
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,000
my man in this

964
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,460
studio.

965
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,220
I'm serious.

966
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,740
I'm serious.

967
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,840
I'm serious.

968
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Life doesn't really stand

969
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,860
in the way of

970
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,440
beautiful.

971
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,060
I'm serious.

972
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,460
Yeah, I'm lonely.

973
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,680
Yeah, I'm lonely.

974
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,700
Yeah, I'm lonely.

975
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,380
Ayyyy!

976
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,760
Ugh!

977
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,140
What is this guy?

978
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,140


979
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,360
What is this guy?

980
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,500
I'm a red rising demon and

981
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,500


982
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,500


983
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,940
What the hell,

984
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,220
please,

985
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:50,740
OK,

986
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,600
baum euphoric

987
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,580
Who knows what you've been doing?

988
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,500
You can even snort them out.

989
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,880
I'm rubbing one up the bottom of my gums.

990
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,080
I'm going to try a line of this human soul hair for you.

991
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,600
Excuse me.

992
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:08,980
Here I go.

993
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,760
Now that's what I call soul.

994
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,540
That must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

995
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,440
Oh, no, that wasn't normal.

996
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,860
I think I got some of his memories off of that.

997
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,500
Wow.

998
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:34,820
Yeah.

999
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,800
I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s.

1000
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,120
Just for a second.

1001
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,660
That's probably the guy's mom.

1002
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,700
Yeah.

1003
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,400
God, you can snort their souls and these little primal memories.

1004
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,540
You've just got to give them final lunch and then dry them out first.

1005
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,520
How long have you guys known about this?

1006
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,980
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

1007
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,540
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,900
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times,

1009
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,820
so they just dry it and keep it with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

1010
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,200
And they just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge cans.

1011
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,560
They didn't have the technology to extract souls.

1012
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,420
I mean, how did they get them under pressure?

1013
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,620
How did they get them into the cans?

1014
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,640
They don't do it that way.

1015
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,260
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants

1016
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,520
and the soul just...

1017
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,360
Just drips out of the nasal and anal...

1018
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:27,800
You're kidding!

1019
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,760
No, it just...

1020
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,680
Why can't we do that?

1021
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,300
We can if we've got the right pills.

1022
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,880
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

1023
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,340
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

1024
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,240
You can go high technology,

1025
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,360
or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys...

1026
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,460
How did Bob set up these extraction machines?

1027
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,660
I mean, what's the...

1028
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,400
All you've got to do is you dig a little pit.

1029
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,060
You dig a little pit in the ground,

1030
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,180
you line it with plastic,

1031
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,740
peg down with wood,

1032
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,880
and then you put the body in...

1033
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,400
A normal.

1034
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,700
A normal, right?

1035
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,080
Yeah.

1036
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,080
Any normal?

1037
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,760
Any normal.

1038
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,120
Any normal isn't dead yet.

1039
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,440
The soul is still in him, right?

1040
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:01,820
Uh-huh.

1041
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,620
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone,

1042
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,820
and then you just jump up and down on him

1043
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,720
until it turns kind of green and thick.

1044
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,400
Then you remove him, strain the liquid,

1045
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,080
then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

1046
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,540
But then there's some kind of ritualistic...

1047
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,820
I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

1048
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,100
Well, there's a group of people around the pit,

1049
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,900
adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see.

1050
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,920
They concentrate...

1051
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,900
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

1052
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,320
Right, so it's done with psychic methods.

1053
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,040
It probably doesn't cost them, you know,

1054
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,600
it costs them a couple of necklaces or, you know,

1055
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,200
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

1056
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,040
They're pet taper.

1057
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,240
The most expense they've got.

1058
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,680
It costs us a hundred grand a year

1059
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,120
to keep these things pumping off.

1060
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,480
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

1061
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
And not to mention the bodies and the souls

1062
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,520
and getting rid of...

1063
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,880
See, the body dissolves.

1064
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,380
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

1065
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,940
Well, do you do up the body, too?

1066
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,460
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

1067
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,240
What do they do with that?

1068
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,580
With that?

1069
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,060
They press it into little cakes and burn it,

1070
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,400
like for fires and stuff like that.

1071
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,840
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

1072
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,060
How come this was, like...

1073
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,680
How come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

1074
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,220
Well, you see, it's because...

1075
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,240
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

1076
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,340
How come we didn't rip them off?

1077
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,120
Well, because we can pay a soul

1078
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,580
and get a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here,

1079
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,520
because, you know, like down there,

1080
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,500
nobody complains if you go through

1081
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,340
four or five hundred bodies in one night.

1082
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,740
You know, you can sit around and smoke all the soul you want.

1083
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,540
I guess it would be kind of questionable

1084
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,780
to be digging pits in your backyard

1085
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,720
and throwing normal bodies in there.

1086
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,040
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

1087
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,680
Noisy, if nothing else.

1088
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,540
It's just little pressed cakes.

1089
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,140
Most people barbecue.

1090
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,340
You can't do on them later, you know.

1091
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,400
You see?

1092
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,080
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away

1093
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,060
to wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

1094
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,400
Well, of course, the thing about...

1095
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,560
That weirds me out, man.

1096
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,580
A lot of things weird me out.

1097
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,380
The fact is that you can't get any good soul here in the States,

1098
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,860
dry or liquid.

1099
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,540
It's always been cut with something.

1100
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,640
And I like my soul unstepped on myself, you know.

1101
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,900
Oh, yeah, they'll use monkey souls, chimpanzee souls.

1102
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,420
Yeah.

1103
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,740
Well, they just take up crystallized...

1104
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,920
It's probably two-thirds...

1105
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,120
They just take crystallized emotions

1106
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,880
and mix them in, for God's sake.

1107
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,520
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage

1108
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,680
mixed in with your soul,

1109
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,140
and the next thing you know, man, you're...

1110
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,640
It's probably what happened to me last week.

1111
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,020
They put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know.

1112
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,800
It just makes you depressed.

1113
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,100
Whereas pure soul is nothing more than a psychic

1114
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,820
and, you know, almanacal amplifier.

1115
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,500
And, you know, if your soul's...

1116
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
If your soul's in good shape when you do pure soul,

1117
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,140
I mean, it's even better.

1118
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,960
But, you know, like, you put stuff that's unstepped on

1119
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,280
and mix it with monkey soul or alligator...

1120
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,060
I'd say, you know, your soul is...

1121
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,120
It's tainted.

1122
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,260
Very tainted.

1123
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,820
You've got holes eating through it, you know.

1124
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:16,160
Running up demagnetized soul, bad golfer soul.

1125
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,920
Yeah.

1126
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,920
Can you imagine?

1127
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1128
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1129
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,400
The news is finished.

1130
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,760
I'm gonna hit all of my days

1131
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,260
and my life in a drug and beauty.

1132
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,760
Pick my head and eat all the bugs.

1133
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,200
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1134
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,220
I went out last night

1135
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,140
and got the drug.

1136
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,040
I fed my father.

1137
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,500
I took the drug.

1138
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,480
And I went home and I took the drug.

1139
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,800
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1140
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,020
If I don't cut the shit,

1141
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,980
it's black to see.

1142
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,120
I'm gonna...

1143
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,460
I'm gonna...

1144
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,660
I'm gonna...

1145
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:27,660


1146
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,600
It's not a hang around with a bunch of drugs.

1147
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,720
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

1148
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,100
My boss says next time I get thrown in jail.

1149
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,500
I'm gonna...

1150
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,120
Hey, let me tell you about my new coat.

1151
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,740
Excellent, right?

1152
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,260
Maybe two bucks.

1153
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,400
My pot is filled with flowers.

1154
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,980
My grass is bright and green.

1155
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:03,260
My tea is brewing in my cup.

1156
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,080
And still I make the scene.

1157
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,140
So just don't try to change me.

1158
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,360
I love the world I found.

1159
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,240
I've got a new coat.

1160
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,240


1161
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,860
I've got to fly my own sweet way.

1162
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,540
Don't you shoot me down.

1163
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,000
Life is such a trippy thing.

1164
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,400
Hello, birdies.

1165
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,500
Hello, spring.

1166
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,400
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

1167
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,480
And I mean just what I say.

1168
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,220
Life is such a groovy thing.

1169
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,440
Don't pick me.

1170
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,280
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling.

1171
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,320
Ding-a-ling.

1172
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,240
Ding-a-ling.

1173
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,840
Ding-a-ling.

1174
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,180
Don't pity me.

1175
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,700
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling.

1176
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,700
A ding-a-ling.

1177
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,500
Ding-a-ling.

1178
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,140
Ding-a-ling.

1179
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,380
Don't pity me.

1180
00:55:59,420 --> 00:55:59,880
Ah.

1181
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,780
Well, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with the Church of the Subgenius.

1182
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,220
Those of you who want to know more about the church can write to Bob.

1183
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,940
That's right.

1184
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,680
Bob at P.O. Box.

1185
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,280
Get that pencil out now, friends.

1186
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,380
P.O. Box 140306.

1187
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,280
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1188
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,000
We're just writing for information, but you won't believe what you get.

1189
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,060
Because you don't know about our books.

1190
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,940
Well, we can.

1191
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,700
We don't know that.

1192
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,000
That's P.O. Box 140306.

1193
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,060
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1194
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,440
If you want to know just what we're playing and what we're doing here.

1195
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1196
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:58,080
Or go ye to www.subgenius.com or email me, stang at subgenius.com.

1197
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,020
But friends, I want to give credit for this mostly old show.

1198
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,620
Hour of Slack number 52 from 1986.

1199
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,580
Ding-a-ling is Frank and Nancy Sinatra Jr.

1200
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,480
Teenager on Drugs was by The Dogmatics.

1201
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:14,620
Thanks.

1202
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,920
That was G. Gordon Gordon describing the extraction of normal souls.

1203
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,180
Actually, from Hour of Slack number 6.

1204
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:30,100
The guy trying to frop for the first time was Sheldon DeWeer, now Pope S. Lilith,

1205
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,360
on the CD The Sheldon Years.

1206
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:44,580
www.foolspress.com or mp3.com slash foolspress.

1207
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:50,580
And of course, friends, we heard God in Prison described by Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz, and me

1208
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,180
on ESO Swamp Radio and WCSB just recently.

1209
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,100
The frop ranting was from the Book of the Subgenius.

1210
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,380
We heard bits of Repo Man, Are You Experienced by Devo and Hendrix.

1211
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,640
Doctors for Bob at DocStock1.

1212
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,520
The Swingin' Love Corpses on the Backside of Reality.

1213
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,500
Dr. Philodrumming in Malaysia.

1214
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,220
Frop Without Slack was by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

1215
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,340
And the background music.

1216
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,240
It's by me and Dr. X.

1217
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,800
Praise Bob and good night, but not goodbye,

1218
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,360
because I will see you at Brushwood, July 5th, 2001, 7 a.m.

1219
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,560
Praise Bob.

1220
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,780
When you leap to swim, the effect will continue.

1221
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,620
Inside of your mind.

1222
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,200
Inside of your own skull.

1223
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,320
Boo!

1224
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,760
Boo!

1225
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:11,100


1226
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:11,180


1227
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:11,180


1228
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,440
Boo!

1229
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:13,820
Boo!

1230
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:13,840
Boo!

1231
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:13,940
Boo!

1232
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:13,940


1233
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,080
Boo!

1234
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,000
We'll be right back.

1235
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,720
We'll be right back.
