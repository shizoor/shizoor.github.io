1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,280
Oh

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,100
The Self Genius

3
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,740
Power of

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,860
Swag

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,140
That was a couple of years ago

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,020
I went back to reform

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,620
school and watched my chance

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,220
and this time I finally escaped

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
But yeah

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,180
back to Bob, Bob Dobbs

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,400
So yeah

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,040
I mean we were quite lucky to get

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,080
Reverend Stang so early on

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,360
Yes we were quite lucky, he does quite a few interviews

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,840
and he never

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
he's always informed, he never misses a beat

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,760
he never misses a beat, so many good quotes

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,560
and so much wit, it's incredible

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,020
Yeah and the guy's been around for a while

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,620
and he's got to hang out with some really cool people

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,660
which you'll find out in the interview

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,700
and you know he's done a lot of interesting stuff for his life

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,780
and this church subgenius is

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,280
an institution

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,080
that's been around for quite a long time now

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,060
Anyway, enough of us waffling on

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,060
Let's roll the Ivan Stang interview

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,040
Yep, enjoy

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,780
What is the church of the subgenius?

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,740
You know that is a a great question

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,480
that none of us have been able to answer

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,600
after 30 years of it

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
sitÃ¤ that it is definitely

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,140
the church devoted to group

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,960
JR Bob Dobbs

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,820
the smiling mysterious faces

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,180
in the square with the parts

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,460
that you see tattooed on so many weirdos

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,500
body parts

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,560
and Bob started this church back in the

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:07,220
50s as a, I guess you could call it a disorganized religion for non-joiners, weirdos, mutants,

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,260
disbelievers, or our favorites, those who will believe anything.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,280
So it's kind of gotten to be a social club in the last few years.

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,020
We were surprised that the weirdos would be able to get along with each other as well

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,700
as they do, for the most part.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,140
Yeah, nice.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,500
It definitely seems to have been going quite well.

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,220
I mean, when did it start, officially?

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:43,560
Well, we first released the secret material to the public in January of 1980, 28 years

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,960
ago.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:52,680
But our guru, Bob, had been developing this ever since his divine immaculation in 1953,

52
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,120
when he had a vision of the alien species.

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,820
And he had a vision of the space god, Jehovah One, a sort of a multi-dimensional monster

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,020
that has pretended to be God successfully to many cultures over the centuries.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,100
This creature informed Bob that throughout history there's been a conspiracy of normal

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,300
people robbing away the slack of all the abnormal and strange people.

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,120
I guess this was part of Jehovah One's design to extract...

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,860
to extract more agony from the human race.

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,500
But then, apparently, this space god wanted to sell the planet off to some other aliens

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,720
and wanted Bob to get it into better shape for the sale.

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:49,640
So Bob was commissioned to travel the world and recruit people to build up his church

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,280
that would, in turn, build up more slack for the truly worthy persons.

63
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,120
That is, anybody who sends...

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,900
sends us $30.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,460
That would be 20 euros, I guess.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,600
It's about 15 pounds, I think.

67
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,560
Yeah.

68
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,960
And technically, you know, a subgenius isn't just anybody who has $30.

69
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:21,080
The true subgeniuses are the people who are descended from the yeti of the Himalayas, or

70
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,060
the Sasquatch of the Americas.

71
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,380
Um...

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,340
But nobody believes that.

73
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,860
And so we found that if we charged $30 for membership, people took us a lot more seriously.

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:05,000
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob!

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,060
So we've been talking a lot about J.R. Bob Dobbs, but could you give us like a brief

76
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,380
overview or biography of who he is?

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Well, yes.

78
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes, the great Bob Dobbs was born of a woman, although it was sort of a miraculous birth.

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:34,460
She wanted to get an abortion, but the tenacious child Bob could not be removed from her holy womb, the womb of Jane Dobbs.

80
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,860
So they took her out to a Kansas wheat field and waited for a tornado to come.

81
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,100
And that successfully yanked the fetus Dobbs out of Jane's womb.

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:58,760
But then when she saw the beauty of Bob's fetusly visage, she, of course, fell in love with him and was glad she had not put him to death.

83
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:09,220
Although, oddly enough, in the Church of the Subgenius, abortions are legal up until the 15th year for any given fetus.

84
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,520
They don't have to be in utero anymore to be aborted in the subgenius family.

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,460
So these kids better watch their step.

86
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:27,100
But Bob, as Bob grew up, he demonstrated almost magical powers.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,740
It was like he could read minds and control the minds of people.

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,800
He was rich by the time he was six years old on the stock market.

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,600
And it's not that he's brilliant.

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,180
In fact, Bob is kind of what you would call retarded.

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,880
If you look at his face, he has that vacant grin, almost like a crazy man's grin.

92
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,740
It's not that he's intelligent, but that he is lucky, and hence the term subgenius.

93
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,580
This isn't about intelligence.

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,300
It's just the opposite.

95
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,240
We feel like intelligence has been misdefined by the conspiracy of the normals for all these centuries.

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,360
And that it's not being smart that counts.

97
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,420
It's being lucky.

98
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,680
Bob is the luckiest fellow in the world.

99
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,780
And for years, he was known among salesmen as the greatest salesman in the world.

100
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:27,500
He could sell hypocrisy to Baptists, ice to Eskimos, and hate to subgeniuses.

101
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,480
And eventually, he realized that if he turned his gifts to religion,

102
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,840
he could sell and sell and sell without ever really even having a solid product.

103
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,600
That you could put your fingers on.

104
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,320
So he was literally selling nothing.

105
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,180
The belief in Slack was enough.

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,840
And so he recruited Dr. Philo Drummond, who then recruited me.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,680
And together, Philo and I in Dallas put together the initial subgenius pamphlets

108
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,220
that were designed to rope in seekers and suckers.

109
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
Because we'll take...

110
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,880
Even if somebody's really just a normal who's...

111
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,840
mentalist, or whatever, he's a normal.

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
He's mentally ill and thinks they're a subgenius.

113
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,780
We'll still take their money.

114
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,440
L. Ron Hubbard taught Bob that although they may be pink of soul,

115
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,760
their money is green in color.

116
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,520
And that's all that counts.

117
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,220
In this country, all of our cash is the same dull color, I'm afraid.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
A lot of what Bob says is sort of inscrutable.

119
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,980
You may be familiar with many of his most famous slogans, such as,

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,820
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

121
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,300
And relax in the safety of your own delusions.

122
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,940
Now, the fact is, you're still blind.

123
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,080
But it sounds good, doesn't it?

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,500
You know?

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,300
And it's better than pulling their wool over your eyes.

126
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,200
And too much, he said, Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.

127
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,840
So he plumbered out on the way to the emergency ward getting his stomach pumped.

128
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,800
Sometimes he leans on the floor.

129
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,800


130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,220
And leaves the not-so-funny ending off of his slogans.

131
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,620
The original was, too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,380
But that doesn't have quite the same kick to it.

133
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,200
You know, college kids don't go for that.

134
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,420
It's too real.

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,160
And as Baldwin Lee Primer said, I've had it up to here.

136
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,560
It's that old, you know, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

137
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,460
I've had it up to here.

138
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,000
And I've also had it down to there.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,040
And frankly, he said, I like it down to there better.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,820
Oh yeah, me too.

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,980
That was Puzzling Evidence imitating me, Reverend Ivan Stang, preaching at Starwood Festival of July 2008.

142
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,820
The radio interview with the real me before that was from the British podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,440
A great interview show.

144
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,980
And all their interviews with various counterculture muckamucks are at the website sittingnow.com.

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,420
We also heard collage by the great Lee Murr.

146
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,840
There will be more of all that.

147
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:26,880
But first, let's go to the Puzzling Evidence show at KPFA in Berkeley where Philo, Puzzling, and Dr. Howell attempt to trick yours truly into playing this very clip.

148
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,560
In the darkness of night.

149
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,240
What would happen to these men?

150
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,200
Superstitions.

151
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,040
From earlier cycles.

152
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,720
The shifty and the shifters.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,960
More primitive agents.

154
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,120
That was me doing Ivan Stang.

155
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,780
And in these shadows, coward dark gods.

156
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,600
Whose malefic influence corrupted the innocent soul of man.

157
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,520
Ivan Stang, Ivan Stang, and we all go down to Ivan Stang.

158
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm gonna vote for Ivan Stang.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,600
Stang for president.

160
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,940
President.

161
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,240
For vice president.

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,860
But what do we really know about Stang?

163
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,460
What do we need to know about Stang?

164
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,980
Nothing.

165
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,980
Nothing.

166
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,700
If you believe everything you read in the book of the subgenius, huh, well, we have a bridge to sell you.

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,000
The fact is, no one really knows much about this mysterious figure called Ivan Stang.

168
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,260
He's one quarter Eskimo and one quarter black.

169
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,680
He's one quarter everything black.

170
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,080
One quarter Chinese.

171
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,180
He's one quarter everything black.

172
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,440
He's the perfect mix of ethnicity.

173
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,240
He will appeal to you and me.

174
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:48,440
To answer this question, one must go back to the beginning of the Stang Empire at the Slacker Mansion in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

175
00:11:48,660 --> 00:12:02,120
Here every year, for the events of the X-Day drill, as it is going to be called, assemble beforehand a historic event which normally transpires in western New York State.

176
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,680
He's a wise old Chinese man.

177
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,040
He's got a beautiful wife.

178
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,240
He's got a beautiful family.

179
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
He's a little bit of a

180
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,220
strong-willed.

181
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,380
He's a good man.

182
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,380


183
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,580
He's a good man.

184
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,580
He's a good man.

185
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,900
sinus cavities.

186
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,080
If we did an hour and a half of singing Ivan's Tang,

187
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,080
do you think he'd put the whole thing on his show?

188
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,420
Like, we could just be one whole show

189
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,340
of him just praising the

190
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,420
crazy Ivan's Tang.

191
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,980
If they do your name for an hour,

192
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,480
you're going to use it for something.

193
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,480
At least a phone message.

194
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,400
And you can hear that phone message

195
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
at QuiveringBrain.com

196
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,040
which is Philo's website

197
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,360
full of all the audio that I can't play

198
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,820
on this decent family show.

199
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,420
And you can also hear more

200
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,200
Dr. Howell on his own show,

201
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,260
Ask Dr. Howell, seen at

202
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,920
AskDrHowell.com

203
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
And meanwhile,

204
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
we go back to England for the

205
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,440
Right Where You Are Sitting Now show

206
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,460
wherein I strive to convince

207
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,560
the world that the Church of the Subgenius

208
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,140
actually can get you laid.

209
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,220
Well, and we hold

210
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,340
events, I mean, this isn't just

211
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
a paper tiger church.

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,780
We

213
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,800
don't

214
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,760
actually get along with each other all that well,

215
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,220
but once a year,

216
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,380
we hold big events

217
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,060
in both

218
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,000
one in Europe and one in

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,260
the U.S. We're hoping to

220
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,960
spread even further to

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,700
Oz and so forth.

222
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,640
But every July 5th

223
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,860
we hold the X Day.

224
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,240
So far they've all been

225
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
X Day drills where we practice

226
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,060
for the end of the world.

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,580
We hope that each July 5th

228
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,460
will be that prophesied day,

229
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,480
but, you know, we're fanatics.

230
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,620
We don't care if we have to wait

231
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,760
8,000 years.

232
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,660
As long as we get our slack.

233
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,600
As long as you get your slack.

234
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,480
And plus, these parties are really fun.

235
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,540
The X Day parties are great.

236
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,000
I mean,

237
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,060
they're kind of like a cross between

238
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,020
a sci-fi convention,

239
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,360
a swingers convention,

240
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,500
and

241
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
I don't know,

242
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,800
some sort of twisted lab experience.

243
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't know.

244
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,980
It's really a lot of fun.

245
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,200
And this,

246
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,560
the one in Europe this year

247
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,900
is in Copenhagen.

248
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,020
I think around July 5th.

249
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,540
But I'm not even sure where.

250
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,600
So,

251
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,000
we've had people come to the one in New York

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
from all over the world.

253
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,580
Some poor devil

254
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,940
showed up from China

255
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,320
once.

256
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
And we're hoping to get a whole gaggle

257
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,320
of them from Great Britain.

258
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,580
Yeah.

259
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,220
We have a lot of friends in,

260
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,300
well, all over the place there.

261
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,060
There are several British popes

262
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,180
at the subgenius church

263
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,100
in competition with each other.

264
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,840
But all rivals pale

265
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,920
in comparison to Dobstown,

266
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
our fabulous walled encampment

267
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,560
in Malaysia,

268
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,200
seen here in this tour of Dobstown

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,080
by Reverend Sweetness McGee.

270
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,200
This place doesn't look a damn thing

271
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
like a travel brochure.

272
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,620
Now you know why there are only

273
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,800
selling one-way tickets.

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,560
If my head wasn't hurting so much,

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,200
I'd have sworn I was in heaven.

276
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,000
Heaven for guys who like big tits.

277
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,820
Holy!

278
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,680
Will you look at them hooters?

279
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,720
What is this, anyway?

280
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,100
Bob?

281
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,420
Some kind of goddamn comic book?

282
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,880
We got robots.

283
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,500
We got cavemen.

284
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
We got kung fu.

285
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,680
I've said it before

286
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,000
and I'll say it again.

287
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,040
War stories and monster movies

288
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,940
are educational.

289
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,140
Educational.

290
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,260
Educational.

291
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,360
Educational.

292
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,980
Praise the Bob.

293
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,640
Praise the Bob.

294
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,660
Praise the Bob.

295
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
Praise the Bob.

296
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,220
Praise the Bob.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
Praise the Bob.

298
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,000
It looks like a refuge.

299
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,100
It smells like a fart.

300
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,180
Bummer.

301
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,880
Well, maybe Dobstown

302
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
needs a little more work.

303
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Thanks to Reverend Sweetness McGee

304
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,440
for that.

305
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,120
So now let us flee Dobstown

306
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,820
for the relative peace and sanity

307
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,900
of the 11th X Day Drill

308
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,060
at Brushwood, New York.

309
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,000
In this case,

310
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,240
a fake hour of slack

311
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,600
being performed on stage

312
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,720
with Dr. Howell,

313
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,460
yours truly,

314
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,960
and the bodacious

315
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,320
Priestess Pisces

316
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,960
discussing the sometimes tortured

317
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,800
sex lives of the subgeni.

318
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,300
Pisces, you look like you...

319
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,780
Would you like to join us?

320
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,120
Up here?

321
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,860
You're welcome to.

322
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,600
I've never known you

323
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,420
to shut your mouth for long.

324
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,540
Take microphone number three.

325
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,380
I could trade places with you

326
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,880
or...

327
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,520
Does that...

328
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,820
Does that look a fair word?

329
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,540
I just...

330
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,140
I was actually quoting Pisces

331
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,360
when I mentioned the hygiene business.

332
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah.

333
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,800
They do for me.

334
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,800
They do.

335
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,940
Well, you might want...

336
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,660
There's a lot of boys here

337
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,000
that come going,

338
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,120
I've heard I could pick up

339
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,020
a mutant girl

340
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,520
that would even like

341
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,900
somebody like me.

342
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,420
And it's true,

343
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,840
although most of the

344
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,560
best ones are taken.

345
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,740
There's some available,

346
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,460
but Pisces,

347
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,340
I think you could give

348
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,980
these boys a chance.

349
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,740
Actually, I can.

350
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,080
I was just talking to

351
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,800
a beautiful,

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,340
beautiful uber femme

353
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,240
who was totally dismayed.

354
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,280
She has been out there

355
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,580
and just looking gorgeous

356
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,760
and smiling

357
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,860
and being kind

358
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,300
to all of these boys

359
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,840
and not one of them

360
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,020
would even give her

361
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,160
a shoulder rub.

362
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,880
What uncouth boys.

363
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,460
And the problem is

364
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,960
is that

365
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,940
I had to explain to her

366
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,400
that subgenius men

367
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,660
aren't really used to women.

368
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,300
And when a beautiful woman

369
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,980
comes up,

370
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,720
it's kind of like

371
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,660
if you had that cat

372
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,860
who always wanted to look

373
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,600
in that cabinet

374
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,940
in the top of the kitchen,

375
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,220
was always trying

376
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,880
to get in there

377
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,820
and then you open the cabinet,

378
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,940
and the cat goes,

379
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,880
oh fuck,

380
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,720
and runs away.

381
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
That's what happens.

382
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,280
No, meow means me.

383
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,040
Replace every meow

384
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,800
with the word me

385
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,140
and cats make perfect sense.

386
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,420
You know, they don't,

387
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,380
they don't meow at each other.

388
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,200
They only meow at people.

389
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,280
That's a greeting

390
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
they have for people.

391
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,080
And it says,

392
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,080
pay attention to me.

393
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,860
That's why it's me.

394
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
It's just me, me, me.

395
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,580
It's me yowling.

396
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,220
Essentially.

397
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,100
Yeah.

398
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,120
But yeah, subgenius men forget

399
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,960
that there's all these

400
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,660
beautiful women

401
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,040
who want to talk to you,

402
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,680
you know,

403
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
and you guys go,

404
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,040
oh crap, it's a girl.

405
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,260
And you kind of freeze up.

406
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,040
Now on the other hand,

407
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,020
then there's the other side

408
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,940
of subgenius men,

409
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,640
and this goes back

410
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,980
to the hygiene issues

411
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,820
and other issues.

412
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,620
Uh-oh.

413
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
The subgenius men

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,680
who don't take hints,

415
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,120
if you're sitting...

416
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
Case in point.

417
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,260
The microphone wasn't taking a hint.

418
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,620
If you're sitting around a campfire

419
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,840
and people start moving away from you

420
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
a lot...

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
You might need to wash.

422
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,660
Exactly.

423
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,140
And by the way,

424
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,220
sitting in the hot tub

425
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,400
doesn't count as bathing.

426
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,060
You've got to use the shower first.

427
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,540
I hope everybody does.

428
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,240
But a lot of you forget that

429
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,700
and you kind of need to remember

430
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
that you do kind of like...

431
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,320
Just because we're out in the woods

432
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,140
doesn't mean that you can go to caveman.

433
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
We don't want that subgenius essence

434
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,880
floating on the surface.

435
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,440
Oh no.

436
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,360
And besides that,

437
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,180
the actual...

438
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,220
The habits of that hygiene

439
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,420
sort of amplify.

440
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
It's like you have a natural Yeti perfume,

441
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,580
but you have to be clean

442
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,840
for that to come out.

443
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,360
And it's sort of like a Yeti pheromone

444
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,100
sends out that signal

445
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,280
to the appropriate mate

446
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,940
with the matching pheromone

447
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,680
because everyone's like,

448
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,500
everyone has a different one

449
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,280
that works together.

450
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,900
That was very clear.

451
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,920
You give a better lesson than I do.

452
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,700
Easy to remember.

453
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,220
So yes, there's a...

454
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,580
I don't know.

455
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,320
I always...

456
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,540
I have girls ask me for the...

457
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,480
You know, boys ask me for the advice

458
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,540
and the girls ask me for the advice

459
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,800
and I think I understand

460
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,820
the boys' perspective, but...

461
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,280
Well, how saintly of you

462
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,200
to take on all this unwarranted advice acting

463
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,460
and to be the Ann Landers

464
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,140
or Abigail Van Buren of X-Day.

465
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Which is funny

466
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,440
because I'm not at all polite.

467
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,760
Well, but people are always seeking answers.

468
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,880
Seeking they will.

469
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,640
Just as many poor bobbies

470
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,780
are seeking companionship,

471
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,700
at the same time right now

472
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,760
there are some really lonely uberfemmes

473
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,140
seeking not necessarily

474
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,200
a wild romp in the hay.

475
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,000
They're not necessarily looking for you

476
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
to last for a four-hour marathon

477
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,220
of yeti sex.

478
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,560
Sometimes they'd just like you

479
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,400
to rub their feet.

480
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,680
They've been walking around

481
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,300
on the hard ground all day.

482
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll rub them.

483
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,560
Not at all.

484
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,820
No, there's a lot of tenderness involved

485
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,520
in caring for an uberfemme.

486
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,960
It only stands to reason.

487
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,180
I know Stang is aware of the care

488
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,600
of uberfemmes and space goddesses

489
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,040
and could probably add something

490
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,760
to his personal experience.

491
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes, when Stang's memoirs are written,

492
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,560
Casanovas will have to take a back seat.

493
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,300
Those are interesting, by the way.

494
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,260
I recommend those.

495
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,300
Casanovas.

496
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,660
Those are a wonderful, wonderful read.

497
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,600
Many volumes.

498
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,680
When my memoirs are written

499
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,840
in blood and vomit

500
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,100
on a cell wall.

501
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,220
What's playing at the Roxy?

502
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll tell you what's playing at the Roxy.

503
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,340
A picture about a Minnesota man

504
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,040
so in love with a Mississippi girl

505
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,720
that he sacrifices everything

506
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,760
and moves all the way to Biloxi.

507
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,480
That's what's playing at the Roxy.

508
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,820
What's in the daily news?

509
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll tell you what's in the daily news.

510
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,480
Story about a guy who bought his wife a small ruby

511
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,020
with what otherwise would have been his union dues.

512
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
That's what's in the daily news.

513
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,060
What's happening all over?

514
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll tell you what's happening all over.

515
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,540
Guy sitting at home by a television set

516
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,220
who used to be something of a rover.

517
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,460
That's what's happening all over.

518
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,380
Love is a thing that has licked him.

519
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,800
And it looks like Nathan's just another victim.

520
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,040
Yes, sir.

521
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,840
When you see a guy

522
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,160
reach for stars in the sky

523
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,000
you can bet that he's doing it for some doll.

524
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,220
When you spot a John

525
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,200
waiting out in the rain

526
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
chances are he's insane

527
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,500
as only a John can be for a Jane.

528
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,180
When you meet a gent

529
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,500
paying all kinds of rent

530
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,200
for a flat that could flatten a Taj Mahal

531
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,480
call it sad.

532
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,720
Call it funny.

533
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,000
But it's better than even money

534
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,460
that the guy's only doing it for some doll.

535
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,620
When you see a Joe

536
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,920
saving half of his dough

537
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,340
you can bet

538
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,940
they'll be making it for some doll.

539
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,120
When a bum buys wine

540
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,640
like a bum can't afford

541
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,160
it's a cinch that the bum

542
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,400
is under the thumb of some little broad.

543
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,140
When you meet a mug

544
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,640
lately ordered

545
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,340
by the jug

546
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,260
and he's still lifting platinum

547
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,420
faulty Raoul.

548
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,640
Call it hell, call it heaven

549
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,000
it's a probable twelve to seven

550
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,440
that the guy's only doing it for some doll.

551
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,560
When you see a sport

552
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,940
and his cash has run short

553
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,940
you can bet that he's banking it with some doll.

554
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,880
When a guy wears tails with the front gleaming white

555
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,800
who the hell do you think he is?

556
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,380
You think he's tickling pink on Saturday night.

557
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,260
When a lazy slob

558
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
takes a good steady job

559
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,340
and he smells from Vitalis and Barbasol.

560
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,780
Call it dumb, call it clever

561
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,900
but you can get odds forever

562
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,620
that the guy's only doing it for some doll.

563
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,220
Some doll, some doll

564
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,360
the guy's only doing it for some doll.

565
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,280
I feel like the first man who landed on the moon.

566
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,240
You're gonna be the first man who landed on a dick.

567
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,840
Well honey you know that you can and will lick my dick.

568
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,380
It could just be so yammy.

569
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,240
Freaks of any kind give me the willies.

570
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,220
You see Javier is the man all men want to be.

571
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,440
Javier is uh...

572
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
It takes a lot of energy.

573
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,780
Javier is the man.

574
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,160
He's the man no woman can say no to.

575
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,860
Yes he's a Rudolph Vasolino type.

576
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,620
And I'm hoping Javier somehow someday trips on this YouTube thing when I get it done.

577
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,040
I know who you're talking about.

578
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,340
He certainly is an oily riser.

579
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,800
Yeah that'll get us done off the air for sure.

580
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,960
I... he goes to bed oily but

581
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,700
I... I suppose that's probably not something one should...

582
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,220
So what you can see up to the north there are the pleasure saucers approaching the town.

583
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,360
There they are?

584
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,820
It's almost next day folks. Almost St. Stupids day.

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,660
Just look at these giant glowing vehicles. They're here. They're here at last.

586
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,660
Oh no are we supposed to crawl inside or do we have like...

587
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,280
Settling down.

588
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,280
We don't have to do anything but the bombings will.

589
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,900
They're gonna come out and bring us in right?

590
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,340
When that cavernous opening extends its ramp.

591
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,360
A private vehicle up to...

592
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,220
Well I'm coming to the cocktail party before next day the end of the year.

593
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,240
When is that?

594
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,080
It's just before the end of the world.

595
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,700
Oh okay.

596
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,680
About sunset.

597
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,200
So that'll be the only time you ever go to X day actually.

598
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,360
Yeah the cocktail party. I'll be there and then people...

599
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,780
You'll be there at the cocktail party.

600
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,500
And then bang a comic cocktail.

601
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,760
At the end. No it's at the beginning.

602
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,960
And then people are gonna talk about how they saw me the whole time.

603
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah see how somber it was that they saw you.

604
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,160
I know he was there. I saw him.

605
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,240
It's like...

606
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,000
He was the guy that killed Bob.

607
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,160
La Jetee. You know they see you again and again.

608
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,860
Get him. That's right.

609
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,480
But uh...

610
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Get him.

611
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,660
Dune to relive the last moments of civilization before the nightmarish nuclear holocaust.

612
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,480
No they would throw me in the air.

613
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,060
They were so sad because you...

614
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,020
Poor little Ivan Stang.

615
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,000
He killed their dream before they could even dream.

616
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,220
Staring dumbfounded at the flickering and now meaningless images of Ivan Stang and puzzling evidence.

617
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
Every time you have to poo.

618
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,880
Doomed to repeat this behavior over and over to the end of time.

619
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,540
There I would be floating in a little scummy pond next to Ivan Stang who praises we sing.

620
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,160
And the frogs still sing in the scummy pond where Ivan Stang was thrown so long ago.

621
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,980
Sorry man I dropped my drink.

622
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,800
No way dude.

623
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,920
Let's see it.

624
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
Well no this is um...

625
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,220
Let's see it.

626
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,640
I gotta run the show here.

627
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,520
This is a classified vid and we...

628
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,760
This video doesn't get exhibited except to...

629
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,860
Really?

630
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,440
Select individuals with a G clearance and that is not a viewer clearance level.

631
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,560
If you give a video...

632
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,920
It's not my clearance level.

633
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,060
I can't see this tape either.

634
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,900
What about the video we did...

635
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,500
Well not that video.

636
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
When we were down there...

637
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,560
That contains embarrassing moments which...

638
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Oh we have another video.

639
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:49,640


640
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:49,640


641
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:49,640


642
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,460
We did it in the lid.

643
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,040
Oh for we're dead.

644
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,100
Where were we at the overman head?

645
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,880
And we were out there on that point.

646
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,560
Over...

647
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,560
Camping at the end of the...

648
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,080
Of course.

649
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,860
Cause I got some...

650
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,500
Let's see what is...

651
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh that's...

652
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm thinking of a...

653
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,440
When...

654
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,060
When...

655
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,100
The overman finds the alien one.

656
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,760
There's a...

657
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,260
There's some funny overman scenes but I've already got them...

658
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,080
Well this was out like there on the...

659
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,140
Well this was out like there on the...

660
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,100
Human soul.

661
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,620
What?

662
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:18,720
What?

663
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:18,720


664
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:18,720


665
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,640
What?

666
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,640


667
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,640


668
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,640


669
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,640


670
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,640


671
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,860
It's a brand new bright Obama day.

672
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,200
What a time to be...

673
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,320
Black.

674
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,840
A girl.

675
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,260
Or gay.

676
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,980
No nothing could go wrong.

677
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,720
So join us in this song of happy days for the gays.

678
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,160
Nothing can go wrong.

679
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,160
Look nobody's watching.

680
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,780
It's time to spread some hate.

681
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,780
And put it in the constitution.

682
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,700
Now how?

683
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,240
Proposition 8.

684
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,900
Proposition 8.

685
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,480
It's great.

686
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,600
He's a...

687
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:49,620
He's a...

688
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,140
He's a...

689
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,500
He's a...

690
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,580
He's a...

691
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,200
He's a...

692
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,540
He's a...

693
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


694
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


695
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


696
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


697
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


698
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


699
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


700
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


701
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


702
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,540


703
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,020
That wasn't right.

704
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,900
That's a lie.

705
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,620
But it works so we don't care.

706
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,340
Now you wish we'd all shut up.

707
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,100
But make our clothes and fix our hair.

708
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,660
And our love's not a sin.

709
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,520
Well the bible says it's so.

710
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,100
Well the bible says a lot of things.

711
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,660
You know?

712
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,800
Jesus Christ.

713
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,880
Hey how's it going?

714
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Lil John.

715
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,680
Jesus, doesn't the Bible say these people are an abomination?

716
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,040
Abomination?

717
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,860
Yeah, but you know, it says the exact same thing about this shrimp cocktail.

718
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Shrimp cocktail?

719
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,540
Leviticus says shellfish is an abomination.

720
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,120
Abomination?

721
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,140
What else does the Bible say, Jesus?

722
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,600
The Bible says a lot of interesting things.

723
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,940
Like you can stone your wife or sell your daughter into slavery.

724
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,740
Well, we ignore those verses.

725
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,000
Well, then, friend, it seems to me you pick and choose.

726
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,980
Me pick and choose.

727
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,300
Well, please choose love instead of hate.

728
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,120
Besides, your nation was built on separation of church and state.

729
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,200
See you later, sinners.

730
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,720
Bye, Jesus.

731
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,820
Bye, Jesus.

732
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,280
I love you, Jesus.

733
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,700
You know, here's another thought to wrap things up.

734
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,140
Oh, every time a gay or lesbian finds love at the parade,

735
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,100
there's money to be made.

736
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,840
He's right.

737
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,820
It's time to groom, say, paint that wedding hall,

738
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,280
and lavender's the shade.

739
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,840
There's money to be made.

740
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,620
That's a point.

741
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,100
Think of all the carriages and four white horses.

742
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,520
There's millions lost from all your disapproval.

743
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,820
Well, that's not good.

744
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,020
Think of all the lawyers for the gay divorces.

745
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,260
Think of the tattoo removing.

746
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,000
We get it, Merrill.

747
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,360
We've been such fools.

748
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,540
I can see America's calling me.

749
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:08,140
Yes, gay marriages will save the economy.

750
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,220
Yay!

751
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,880
Yay!

752
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,520
Yay!

753
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,040
That doesn't look like me at all.

754
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,100
If you were turned inside out, that's the way you'd look.

755
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,600
I am so sick and tired of these fucking actresses with big piss.

756
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,260
I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

757
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,760
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,

758
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,400
I reach over and touch it.

759
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
We've experienced a solar disturbance.

760
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
It has the same effect as if it came from our own sun.

761
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,640
Shorting TV and communication relations.

762
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,500
The magnetic disturbance that disordered the ship.

763
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,180
But once those particles bounce off, the magnetic field realigns itself.

764
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,420
Now, I can say yes, we're completely removed from that.

765
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,260
You're naive.

766
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,720
I think we turned our original course.

767
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,200
I reach over and touch it.

768
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,160
I reach over and touch it.

769
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,200
If you want to be happy, you want to have legs open and your mouth shut.

770
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,140
And your mouth shut.

771
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,520
You're a lousy human.

772
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,280
more than any woman I've met for a long time.

773
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,400
Mike, I think I've uncovered something.

774
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,100
Oh, what?

775
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,620
Girls.

776
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,960
I'm serious.

777
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,320
Look.

778
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,200
Half naked?

779
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,500
Oh, my God.

780
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm in a titty bar?

781
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,620
I don't see a thing.

782
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,100
Huh?

783
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,880
Half naked?

784
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, my God.

785
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm in a titty bar?

786
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,480
I don't see a thing.

787
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,080
Huh?

788
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
If you must copulate,

789
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,760
why don't you go outside and do it?

790
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,400
Why don't you just shut up?

791
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm just getting ready to blast off.

792
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,160
I reach over and touch it.

793
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,780
I reach over and touch it.

794
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,620
Half naked.

795
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,040
Half naked.

796
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm in a titty bar?

797
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,280
I'm in a titty bar?

798
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm in a titty bar?

799
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,220
I'm in a titty bar?

800
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,500


801
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm in a titty bar?

802
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm in a titty bar?

803
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,300
I'm in a titty bar?

804
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,880
I'm in a titty bar?

805
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,740
I'm in a titty bar?

806
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,980
I reach over and touch it.

807
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,440
A scene from X-Day, edited by Reverend Sweetness McGee.

808
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,760
Before that, the song was from Proposition 8, the musical.

809
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,280
I found that on YouTube.

810
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,140
We overheard the Puzzling Evidence gang planning their crimes against me.

811
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:13,400
Me, and before that, the song Guys and Dolls from the 1950 album of the Broadway play of the same name.

812
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:23,680
By the way, you are listening to the Hour of Slack number 1185 from the church of the subgenius Praise Bob.

813
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,020
You can and will learn way more from our gigantic website, subgenius.com.

814
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,880
And now, the weather report.

815
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,820
Hello from Palm Springs.

816
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,360
Why, hello there.

817
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,780
Hello, Palm Springs. Come in, Palm Springs.

818
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,820
What's the temperature like there?

819
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,400
It's beautiful, actually. It's finally cooling down.

820
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:44,700
Yeah.

821
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a good time to take a bike ride.

822
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,180
I just did a few days from, let's see, Las Vegas, driving up through Tiago Pass.

823
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
Hurricane Xerxes is on its way.

824
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,580
It's just like you said. It was all clear and nice.

825
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,360
Clear skies, smooth sailing.

826
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,780
Me too.

827
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,120
I would like to see the top 100 or so people who get written in.

828
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,220
Each election for president.

829
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,160
Who gets the write-in vote?

830
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,840
Yeah, the Ivans.

831
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,240
Ralph Fielding Snell.

832
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,400
See who got the most votes.

833
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,200
And George Stovall.

834
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:22,140
And then you'd end up being vastly skewed with all those 12 million people that voted for themselves.

835
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,620
The original President Stovall.

836
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,600
The people that the top 100 vote for.

837
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,400
The unknown president.

838
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,440
Bob Dobbs. I always vote Bob Dobbs.

839
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,440
Bob Dobbs? He's no schlop.

840
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,000
Bob Dobbs?

841
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,800
That probably offsets my vote for Ivan Stang.

842
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,820
But I wonder who...

843
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,500
How many...

844
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,380
You wouldn't vote for Stang? That wouldn't be good government?

845
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,960
I mean, no. I never voted for Stang.

846
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
I write in Stang as the VP.

847
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,260
The head of the Mormon church might get a lot of votes.

848
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,560
The best government of all is the dominion of the philosophy.

849
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,500
Joseph Stang?

850
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,200
Joseph Stang, yeah, that's the one I meant.

851
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,520
Joseph Stangle.

852
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,400
His great, great, great granddad.

853
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,120
Well, that would be an interesting thing to know.

854
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,120
It would be. That'd be a neat...

855
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,560
That might be really obscure.

856
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,100
I wonder how you'd go about finding some of the early...

857
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
Yeah, how would you find that out?

858
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,960
And who would keep those types of records?

859
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,480
There's gotta be records of that.

860
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah, yeah.

861
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,400
By tippy-tippy-tipping your internet, of course.

862
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,620
There's a chance, of course.

863
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,860
Type in the search engine.

864
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Right.

865
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,420
Right.

866
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,860
Kiss your sticky notes goodbye.

867
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,680
The thing is, the website somewhere where all the...

868
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,680
The written in...

869
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,780
The write-in vote...

870
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,720
Written on the win.

871
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,180

Yeah, or...

Top write-in vote-getters plus all cities plus...

877
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,680
Yeah.

883

Maybe it's just Schmedley Schmidlap, you know?

884
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,280
Well, if you put that in, you get every answer...

885
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,520
Ralph Fielding Snell and, of course, Byron Harris Bringer.

886
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,840
Schmedley Schmidlap.

887
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,500
Schmedley Schmidlap.

888
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,140
...has deaf to jiggle.

889
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,500
Have you gotten by Walgreens to check out those skull rolls?

890
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,200
I have, but I have not.

891
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,660
I don't think I've seen the skulls you am talking about.

892
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,460
Walgreens has some of the best skull stuff.

893
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,160
They're boss bitchin' and groovy.

894
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,260
They still might have some.

895
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,020
And they have screamers.

896
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,280
Don't...

897
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,300
Did you see the screamers?

898
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,840
Yeah.

899
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,320
You mean the movie?

900
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
The new screamers.

901
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,040
New screamers?

902
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,460
No, they're pocket screamers.

903
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,680
Pocket screamers.

904
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,060
You can put them in your pocket and they just scream.

905
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,280
Oh, my.

906
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,320
I am.

907
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,220
Well, I am.

908
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,720
Like a woman?

909
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,240
Oh, my.

910
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,300
Like a woman screaming.

911
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,920
Like a rabbit screaming.

912
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,100
Like a little bobby screaming.

913
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,000
Or like the victim of an axe murderer screaming.

914
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,600
Or an alien being disemboweled by a...

915
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,980
An unthinkable thing just disemboweled by a...

916
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,160
...faceless goon.

917
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,220
For the delay trigger.

918
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,820
Yeah, that one.

919
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,800
You walk away and then they leave them in an alleyway.

920
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,100
In a big city somewhere.

921
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,840
Yeah, they are.

922
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah, then the zombies close in on you.

923
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,320
The little poured out bobbies are left by churches usually.

924
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,880
But hope is not necessarily fully extinguished even in those situations.

925
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,500
Their minds drain of thoughts.

926
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,860
And their wallets drain of all that money.

927
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,840
They've been totally cordwangled in their bogle.

928
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,960
And they're still alive.

929
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,600
Yeah.

930
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,680
From their guggle to their zatch.

931
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,740
Then the UFO comes back later and picks up the cartons.

932
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,440
They spend all their time screaming like that.

933
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,300
They use them for fuel.

934
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,400
And now the shrieking starts.

935
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,520
Then the dandos come and stuff them in their gander bags.

936
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,400
Really?

937
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,980
Yeah.

938
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,900
Along with their rucksacks.

939
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,640
Yes.

940
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,180
Then Johnny Rucksack stumbled in his tucker bag.

941
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,380
Under the shade of a couliba tree.

942
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,320
And we wangled with the bunion.

943
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,820
Then we wangled the jumbuck.

944
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,460
We wangled the jumbuck in the air.

945
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,020
And after we snarked the jumbuck.

946
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,400
I snarked the crap out of that jumbuck.

947
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,620
Down came the snark.

948
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,680
Manon walloped the jumbuck.

949
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,980
And then we grunged the jumbuck for a while.

950
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,240
And after we had our way.

951
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,340
We threw it on the gogles.

952
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,300
We threw it on the gogles.

953
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,380
We threw it on the gogles.

954
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,780
And we cord wangled our bogles.

955
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,160
And we threw it on the gogles.

956
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,780
And we barfed Matilda with me.

957
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,860
And so forth.

958
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,460
Yeah.

959
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,760
Bob replaces the drugs.

960
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Just looking closely at the dots that comprise his face.

961
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,240
Eats up so many brain cells.

962
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,040
And it's just like using the drugs.

963
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,580
He is, shall we say, the Chinese finger trap of the mind.

964
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,380
He is, shall we say, the Chinese finger trap of the mind.

965
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,380


966
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,260
That's what Bob is.

967
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,960
But most importantly, above all else, Bob is a short duration personal savior.

968
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,200
We're in a world of planned obsolescence.

969
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:25,440
And Bob knows that you're not always going to be in the mindset where you definitely need Bob as your main personal savior.

970
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,620
You might have to fall back on Jesus sometimes.

971
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,720
Or whatever you grew up with.

972
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,640
Or some porno star that you are enamored of.

973
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,740
It's revolving messiahs.

974
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,480
You will be one too yourself.

975
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,560
In fact, you might be somebody's short duration personal savior right now and not even know it.

976
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,300
The suching is church is real.

977
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,760
In that if you think about it, it's a hell of a lot bigger than Heaven's Gate, for instance.

978
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,640
How many of them killed themselves?

979
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,460
Thirty-nine.

980
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,500
And then there was another fifty or so that wussed out.

981
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,560
And Jim Jonestown, speaking of interest in cults, had nine hundred people.

982
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,200
This guy got nine hundred people to kill themselves.

983
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:19,960
Friends, there are like nine thousand subgeniuses whose addresses we still have.

984
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:29,700
There's more like forty thousand of them who are standing there thirty bucks, but we know no more where they are now than where all that money went.

985
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:31,900
But!

986
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,580
We have a very active social life.

987
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:46,980
It's unlike, oh, but there's lots of funny rival cults like the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Scientologists and so forth.

988
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,600
They're all also satirical takeoffs.

989
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,920
But they don't, they haven't been around this life.

990
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,160
Certainly not the Flying Spaghetti Monster folks.

991
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,760
Praise the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

992
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,580
But they've been around long enough that I run into kids, I run into grown-ups who say,

993
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,640
Oh man, my parents were into Bob.

994
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,280
I hate that shit.

995
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,220
They made me memorize that stuff.

996
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,980
And then I also run into people who go,

997
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,660
Wow, I used to listen to your radio show, Hour of Slack, when I was a teenager.

998
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,200
Man, we couldn't live without it.

999
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,200
We listened all the time.

1000
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,440
And that's when I have to go,

1001
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,020
It's still on.

1002
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,820
I can't believe it.

1003
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,480
I can't believe it.

1004
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:34,760
I can't believe it.

1005
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:34,820
I can't believe it.

1006
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,780
How many members do you get?

1007
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
For a year, roughly?

1008
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:47,180
Well, these days, about, depending on the weather, three to five people officially join the church every day.

1009
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:56,300
We've probably totaled up, it's hard to say because a lot of them have moved and we've lost track of them.

1010
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,220
I mean, we've been around 28 years.

1011
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:05,740
I would guess that roughly 30 to 40,000 people have sent that 30 bucks.

1012
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,880
Yeah.

1013
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,240
Although we can only get our hands on about 8,000 of them at any given time.

1014
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,180
Now, what's strange about this is look at some of the cults that get so much press.

1015
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,520
Heaven's Gate, the famous suicide cult.

1016
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,300
Jonestown, another famous suicide cult.

1017
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,200
The Branch Davidians from my time.

1018
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,020
The Branch Davidians from my hometown in Texas.

1019
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,600
Yeah.

1020
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,160
And those cults are like maybe 100 to 1,000 people, if that many.

1021
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,140
Heaven's Gate only had 39 casualties.

1022
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:53,060
There are so many subgeniuses that we won't even begin to pass out the poison Kool-Aid unless we know we can off 1,000 people at once.

1023
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,200
So, you know, the Jonestowns.

1024
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,280
The Jonestowns and the Branch Davidians.

1025
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,240
There's some end of the world people in Russia lately.

1026
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:14,400
And we had fundamentalist Mormons here once again in Texas in the U.S. causing some embarrassment for the authorities.

1027
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,200
And yet the Church of the Subgenius is much, much bigger than most of those.

1028
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,180
Yeah.

1029
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,480
So I can see why the conspiracy tries not to talk about us.

1030
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,180
Yeah.

1031
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,100
Because it would only make things worse for them.

1032
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,680
Because you're more of a powerful group in numbers at least.

1033
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,000
Right.

1034
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,780
Well, and that's about all we have is numbers.

1035
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,240
None of us are very good with weapons.

1036
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,900
We're not really, most of us are not violent except with our dearest friends and loved ones.

1037
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,560
So it's not much of a terrorist kind of a cult.

1038
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,800
And plus we're into slack.

1039
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,040
Yeah.

1040
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:55,220
You know, Bob said the aliens will come in the year 1998 and destroy all the humans.

1041
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,320
And save the dues paying subgeniuses.

1042
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:04,040
So we are, every year we wait to see whether this is the real 1998.

1043
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,940
But we're not going to destroy the world ourselves.

1044
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,700
We're slackers and we're going to wait and let the aliens do it for us.

1045
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,360
Yeah.

1046
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,160
So.

1047
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,680
Hey, let's go down this.

1048
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,680
Let's see what's down this hallway.

1049
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,560
And remember the bunyip and the whistling tea kettle.

1050
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:17,920
Shh.

1051
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,240
Okay.

1052
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,760
What's down that hallway?

1053
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,680
Can we get down there with this equipment?

1054
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't know.

1055
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,360
Why?

1056
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,080
You mean there's something not on the QT?

1057
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,860
Hey, this is Kenneth Spoon.

1058
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,600
Quentin Tarantino?

1059
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,300
I'm just saying that there's something that's a little bit hinky about this operation.

1060
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,720
Are we supposed to like.

1061
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,340
This is Ivan Stang's office.

1062
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,180
Oh well.

1063
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:38,680
This is Ivan.

1064
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,440
We don't have any business here.

1065
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:40,720
I have no idea how much the church makes.

1066
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,060
Let's look in these drawers.

1067
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,620
Oh my god.

1068
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,100
What time is it?

1069
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,580
It's 11.

1070
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,680
I can't get this drawer open.

1071
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:44,900
It's.

1072
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,160
Ivan Stang.

1073
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,440
Look, there's three locks.

1074
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,780
Look, it's glowing.

1075
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,580
There's three locks on this drawer.

1076
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,260
Uh oh.

1077
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,380
Look, there is a, there's a radiant glow coming out from under that desk.

1078
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,200
This is the church room.

1079
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,800
It's a mailing list.

1080
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,600
Oh, that somebody's on the phone too.

1081
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:00,960
Uh oh.

1082
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,880
Somebody's tripped an alarm.

1083
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,860
There's nobody here.

1084
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,220
It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

1085
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,300
He's going to be here in here.

1086
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,680
He's going to knock you off.

1087
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,080
Oh my gosh.

1088
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,840
If I could only find the doorknob, but it seems to be slippery and moving around.

1089
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,240
That's me.

1090
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,680
That's me holding onto your pockets.

1091
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,520
Oh my gosh.

1092
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

1093
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:13,820
Well.

1094
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,820
All I have to say is.

1095
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,300
I thought that was your pocket.

1096
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,560
This is a situation which calls for wonder wash.

1097
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,180
I think if we keep sneaking along this wall, we'll be able to get out of here.

1098
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,460
Before Stang catches us.

1099
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:27,820
Yeah, well.

1100
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,580
Of course, we left enough DNA in that office.

1101
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,160
Of course, when you say that, the wonderful drug is supposed to appear.

1102
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,240
So he'll be able to replicate us in no time.

1103
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,480
And he didn't appear, so.

1104
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,500
You know.

1105
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,240
Really, that doesn't help us at all.

1106
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:36,560


1107
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,960
You're Vogel.

1108
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,600
You left the Vogel in there.

1109
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,360
I beg your pardon.

1110
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:40,920
Herr Vogel.

1111
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,220
And there's enough Cordwangle left.

1112
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,680
Cordwangle Smith science fiction story.

1113
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,700
That I'm sure the DNA can be extracted.

1114
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,720
And then our cordless model.

1115
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,440
And we can have to worry about clone technology.

1116
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,100
Uh oh.

1117
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,040
You'll never hear the moan of a clone.

1118
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,160
Uh oh.

1119
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,160


1120
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,160


1121
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,160


1122
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,160


1123
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,160


1124
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,340
You're going to do it again and again.

1125
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:03,440
Our new generation knows special pseudos are priceless duplicated to provide the very best

1126
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
in synthetic choice.

1127
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,940
If you don't help them, they'll just make instant clone out of you and not be off.

1128
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,180
But don't take our word for it.

1129
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,660
Toddle on down to the Clonatorium.

1130
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,520
Your clone.

1131
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,500
And view the models now on display.

1132
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:12,940
It'll teach them to be more compliant.

1133
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,920
Their time is your time.

1134
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,020
That's the way to do it.

1135
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,200
And for a limited time.

1136
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,260
You don't do what I say, I'll.

1137
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,140
Get Mini Clone Junior.

1138
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,460
I'll make a clone out of you who is more compliant.

1139
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,240
You'll love him.

1140
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,300
An instant clone.

1141
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,920
I'm just going to talk about that guy.

1142
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:25,760
That's the clone.

1143
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,700
That's the Clone Ranger.

1144
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,060

wow

1198
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,240
wow

1199
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,420
another uh group of news was there oh oh oh

1200
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,160
inside

1201
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,380
Insight, Smiling Bob, the dude is going to prison.

1202
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,740
He had to forfeit a billion dollars.

1203
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,720
He's losing his home and his mom's going to jail.

1204
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,840
That's what happens when you try to cop J.R. Bob Dove.

1205
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,380
For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about,

1206
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:44,760
on certain cable network channels, you're harassed endlessly by these ads for male enhancement pills

1207
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,320
called Insight.

1208
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,320
And they're actually pretty funny ads.

1209
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,700
But they stole Bob for him.

1210
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,360
It's Bob, but without a pipe.

1211
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,380
And they call him Bob.

1212
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,340
And he grins and he's stupid, but he has a big wanger because of these pills.

1213
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,740
Which, by the way, are a complete fraud.

1214
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,600
And they were convicted of fraud.

1215
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,080
And the guy and his mom are going to be locked up and lose everything.

1216
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,080
I've been telling everybody that I get half.

1217
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,720
Actually, we didn't even try to mess with that.

1218
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:20,460
Our policy generally is to avoid anything that has to do with lawyers at all.

1219
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,360
Because they get all the money.

1220
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,080
My dad's a lawyer.

1221
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,580
How do you think I became a preacher, friends?

1222
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,060
Actually, I found out I'm descended from...

1223
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,560
At least four of my great-grandfathers were preachers.

1224
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,820
Probably crazy preachers.

1225
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,280
So, you never know.

1226
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,040
Bob Raskolnikov.

1227
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,620
Steve.

1228
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,560
Steve K.

1229
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,560
Thank you, sir.

1230
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,480
Thank you, sir.

1231
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,560
Thank you very much.

1232
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,700
Good luck to you, and God bless you.

1233
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:54,720
Dostoevsky.

1234
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,940
Subgenius.

1235
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,860
Subgenius.

1236
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,100
Come in.

1237
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,260
Think you're funny, huh?

1238
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:01,960
Here.

1239
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,900
You dirty!

1240
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,240
You old hag!

1241
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,460
Come in.

1242
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,880
I haven't done anything.

1243
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,680
You don't want to go.

1244
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:13,700
You dirt.

1245
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1246
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1247
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1248
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1249
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1250
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1251
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,700


1252
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,520
What's going on here?

1253
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,280
Who's that maniac?

1254
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:17,780
Bob.

1255
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,540
He's a writer.

1256
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,060
Huh?

1257
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:19,540
Oh.

1258
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,040
Oh.

1259
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,320
I confess!

1260
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,660
Doesn't your conscience ever bother you?

1261
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,020
No.

1262
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,000
Well, leave me alone.

1263
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,040
And now, a touching farewell from Bob Walkenhorst.

1264
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,940
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1265
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,100
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1266
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,320
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1267
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,320
I hate to derail your train of thought.

1268
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,300
Sorry to interrupt in mid-sentence for you.

1269
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,500
Hammer and nail me to the spot.

1270
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,780
Well, excuse me, I was just leaving.

1271
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,760
I used to be the lover that you celebrate.

1272
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,680
Now I'm just leaving.

1273
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,920
Someone you barely tolerate.

1274
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,440
I hate to leave the house in such a mess.

1275
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,540
But that's what happens when you bleed to death.

1276
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,080
And baby, excuse me, I was just leaving.

1277
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,680
Yes, I gotta go.

1278
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,860
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1279
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,840
Oh, no, no, no.

1280
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,380
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1281
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,160
Baby, I'm leaving.

1282
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,380
Excuse me.

1283
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,740
I was just leaving.

1284
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,640
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1285
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,900
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

1286
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,940
Oh, no, no, no.

1287
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,680
Love has a way of hanging around.

1288
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,240
Long after kindness has left town.

1289
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,660
Sorry to come between you and your demons.

1290
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,440
Excuse me.

1291
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,740
I was just leaving.

1292
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,820
Fun isn't always of the same size.

1293
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,920
Three years from now I'm addressed by a drama queen.

1294
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,440
I'll hate the number on the wall.

1295

Dude, you're on the wrong trail.

1301
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,060
Get away.

I hate being up here.

00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,940
We're glad you're here.

1315
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,380

This is the place where Barney likes to hang out.

1322
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,900
He came out a little early.

1323
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,180
Liar.

1324
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,180
As we quarter Americans, also share our blessings.

1325
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,380
It's the spirit that moves men and women to be scout leaders.

1326
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,060
Liar.

1327
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,700
There you go.

00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,520
