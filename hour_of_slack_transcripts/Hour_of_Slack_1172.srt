1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,560
You'll have to excuse Ivan's manner.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,920
If you behave yourself, he'll hurt you.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,540
Look, what kind of a creep joint is this?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,840
Place of research, and Ivan.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,880
Oh, yeah?

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,860
That's a genius.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,680
I rate a slap.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,260
Perfect.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,620
I guarantee you're surrounded by bobs.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,080
And there's never been a now.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,460
Bob will show you how to create now, free.

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,080
A current total now, Bob.

14
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,580
Absolutely free.

15
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,060
And for a first-hand version of how to hold a bob.

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,160
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,420
Call now to get Bob's newest mouth, free.

18
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,140
That's 800-744-74-643-99-94-7-7-4-9.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,720
Why now? Why free?

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,980
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,960
Joker, man.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,600
What do you do with all your money?

23
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,940
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

24
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,820
I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder.

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,560
And gasoline.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,080
What's this?

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
And you know the thing that they have in common?

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
They're cheap.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm broken down.

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,120
Yes, I'm broken down.

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,840
Into the elements from which I came.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,480
Into the mud where they wrote my name.

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,180
Into the dust when the blood is gone.

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,520
Into molecules and atoms.

35
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,280
I'm broken down.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,620
I'm broken down.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,020
Yes, I'm broken down.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm out of words, I'm down to size.

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,400
There's much less to me than meets the eye.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm not the man.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,280
I used to be.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,620
You'll be seeing less and less of me.

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm broken down.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,580
I can see it all now.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,940
I'll be sitting in a chair.

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
People talking to me.

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,600
But I ain't there.

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,960
What about Bob?

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,240
Where'd he go?

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,140
I don't know.

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,900
He was here just a second ago.

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,220
He must have broke down.

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm broken down.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm broken down.

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm broken down.

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,440


57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
I'll pay the rents and the rent alone.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,800
I'll just bid when the money's gone.

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,500
But I'll never leave, don't fear.

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,460
I'll just stay right here and disappear.

61
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm broken down.

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm broken down.

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,280
I'm broken down.

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm broken down.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm broken down.

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm broken down.

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm broken down.

68
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm broken down.

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,380
Praise Bob.

70
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,420
Praise Bob.

71
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,240
Praise Bob.

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,240


73
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,240
That was Bob walking towards...

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,840
I don't think anything makes any difference anymore, does it, Jerry?

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't think anything makes any difference anymore, does it, Jerry?

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,460
Oh, that's not Jerry.

77
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
That's the Reverend Ivan Stagg.

78
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,840
No, that wasn't Bob.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,880
That wasn't me singing.

80
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,300
That was Bob singing.

81
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,860
Bob Walkenhorst from his newest album, I think.

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,800
The Beginner.

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,980
He used to be with the Rainmakers.

84
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,380
But they ran out of water, I guess.

85
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,020
They're liars.

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,620
A pack of cheesy liars.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
Oh my goodness.

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Oh my goodness.

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,920
We're all broken down here, friends.

90
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,000
We barely made it into the station.

91
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,600
We're all sick, sick, sick, sick.

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,300
Actually, I'm not sick.

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,680
He's a big one.

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,320
A whole bunch of people.

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,320


96
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,900
A lot of your withering hair and skin left.

97
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:04,900


98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:04,900


99
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:04,900


100
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:04,900


101
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh, mamma mia, mother of demons trois.

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,300
As doctor L locking our body,

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:22,740
andt think we can't take benzoin...

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,220
Oh, well, we've got hemoglobin

105
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,260
and Camb unacceptable.

106
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,260


107
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,180
Dave, we'll have to share.

108
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,100
I can body slam this broad into the wall like a hockey player.

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,720
Now, now.

110
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,020
No, but you know that maybe if this microphone did work,

111
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,560
could you actually see if it'll come up?

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
Or it just doesn't work because of the studio work.

113
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,400
We're moving WCSB now that that's interesting to anybody across the land.

114
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm not on the mic at all, you see.

115
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,280
Bugger off with all that.

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Hey, yeah.

117
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,880
Friends, pray for Mike.

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,820
Poor Mike.

119
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,120
The microphone, he was an early chutney.

120
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,260
Actually, there was a subgenius who went by the name of Reverend Mike Rophone.

121
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,540
And he was one of Susie the Flusie's co-hosts on one of the other subgenius shows.

122
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,980
The great one on WREK Atlanta.

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,120
That takes place actually in another dimension.

124
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
I don't know if you're completely and totally aware of that

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,960
because you like to be the omnipotent, all-seeing eyeball of the church.

126
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,240
But Susie...

127
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,140
Susie the Flusie's show on WREK, isn't it?

128
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Right.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
In Atlanta, Florida.

130
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,600
I mean, Atlanta, Georgia.

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,160
She, that show...

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,660
A wreck of a station?

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,240
That show is actually taking place concurrently in another dimension,

134
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,740
which is why comparisons and analogies can't be made.

135
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,340
I mean, between her and this one, for instance.

136
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,060
Well, in our new studio at WCSB, we'll actually have a urinal and urinal cakes to put our little birthday...

137
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,400
Right in the studio, yeah.

138
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,300
Right next to where the DJ sits so that...

139
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,940
A person in my position would never have to get up.

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,240
But, yes, friends, we've learned a lot because of our sick friends.

141
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:15,240
We learned that if you are in the hospital, you need someone else there, a lawyer preferably,

142
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,260
all the time to keep you from being neglected

143
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,240
because that's just the way they run things in hospitals.

144
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,040
And that's the same way with our economy.

145
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,920
It's been sick, and there hasn't been the right...

146
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,420
There's a right doctor there, and you need a lawyer for it to sicken you less.

147
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,680
Oh, speaking of our economy, hold off just a second, Dave,

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,280
because I have a public service announcement here, okay?

149
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,500
Which I'm going to read, but it's not real long.

150
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,120
So this news commercial is brought to you by Reverend Dr. Mistar Sistar.

151
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, you too can own the United States blue-chipped companies at drastically reduced prices.

152
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,840
Act fast.

153
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
It still can't last too long.

154
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,240
Imagine owning partial shares in big banks and investment companies.

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
What would you pay for a share?

156
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
$72? $35?

157
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,280
No, we're marking prices to the bone.

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,920
Just five bucks a share while they last.

159
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,080
Far, far below the original cost.

160
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,280
Some shares may be gently used.

161
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,480
Impress your friends.

162
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,500
Make your neighbors jealous.

163
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Walk with pride knowing you're right up there rubbing shoulders with the captains of industry.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
Make your bid today before the market closes at 4pm.

165
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,000
No price is considered too low for these great companies.

166
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,160
We reserve the right to oversell the shares, but be assured you'll have them in your hands pronto

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,140
as our buyers are now all over the world looking for bargains.

168
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,540
Don't be caught short.

169
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,460
No credit?

170
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,720
No problem.

171
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,760
And the printed certificates are works of art in themselves.

172
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
Paper your walls with them.

173
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Make doilies.

174
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,880
Wrap fish.

175
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,760
At prices this low, who can resist?

176
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,100
This is not an offer to sell or buy.

177
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,900
Such offers are only made in the prospectus, which can be viewed as a waste of time.

178
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:56,900


179
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,860
You can view it in PDF form at www.nostradamus.com slash fall specials.

180
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,460
Praise Bob.

181
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,020
Praise Bob.

182
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,540
Praise Mr. Sistar for the news there.

183
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,940
Mr. Sistar.

184
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,680
Yes, it's true.

185
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
The United States is now for sale.

186
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:21,400
I was so glad to hear that the government was bailing out all those rich people using our money that we don't have.

187
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:21,880
Right.

188
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,780
The tax the average ordinary ranking person with swine flu is now being...

189
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:35,700
Forced into a small little vessel and has to compromise his own existence just to keep these banks floating like a mighty turd in the wrong toilet.

190
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,100
Mighty.

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:46,620
And I personally, I don't want to sound a little wobbly here, but I noticed that my, my, the hairs above my, what do they call those, my eyebrows?

192
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,940
You look a little wobbly.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Yeah, so I don't want to be a little wobbly here, but my eyebrows are getting pretty thick, comrade.

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,860
You know what I'm saying?

195
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,940
I don't know what I'm saying.

196
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,960
Chunky style.

197
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,000
That's what I say.

198
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,880
Yeah, that's what I say.

199
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,200
That's what I say, too.

200
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,120
Now, wait a minute.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,120
I think Stan's going to read another thing here.

202
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,020
Well, actually, I was...

203
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,760
It's a news brief.

204
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,120
It's because, friends, you know, we do this work, this slack for free.

205
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,560
But some people donate out of the goodness of their hearts to the Hour of Slack.

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,900
And I'm going to read off the names of people who have donated.

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,880
Our beautiful donators.

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,820
Here we have Steve Krause.

209
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
Praise donators.

210
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,580
From Dolby Labs.

211
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,680
We have Jesse Bennett.

212
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
Praise Jesse Bennett.

213
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,200
No, broke it.

214
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,220
Charles Birmingham.

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,340
Oh, thank you very much, city in Alabama.

216
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,100
Reverend Luna Tim.

217
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,700
Oh, thank you.

218
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,560
Yes, Reverend Luna Tim.

219
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:49,420
Luna Tim was the one who built great artworks out of dominoes that would then fall down all over his house.

220
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,260
The little sugar.

221
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,060
Oh, the dynamic.

222
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,100
He was a dynamic fellow.

223
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,680
And Reverend Justin Jacobs.

224
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,080
And Reverend Sibethulu, it says here.

225
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,740
These are all people who have gone to the trouble of donating to the Hour of Slack specifically.

226
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,740
Not the station, but the show per se.

227
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,860
Actually, they download the show.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,560
That's why they donated it.

229
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,540
They get it off the intranets, you see.

230
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,240
This is my music being translated into another language.

231
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,340
Yes, your music is in the background.

232
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,800
Yes, yes.

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,660
This is the old...

234
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,260
This is the old Einstein Secret Orchestra witch disco album playing in the background.

235
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,700
So, it's a haunted station.

236
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,360
It certainly is.

237
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,360
There's cobwebs about.

238
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,680
Chaz is back.

239
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,340
A spider scurrying from corner to corner.

240
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,900
The old janitor, Mr. Kindly Fishman.

241
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,940
What was his middle nostril?

242
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,280
Kindly Fishman has passed out for the last time underneath the console.

243
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,700
Nostril domus.

244
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,180
With his bucket mostly intact.

245
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,120
He's mopped up his last floor here at WCSB.

246
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,220
And we are really moving into kind of a space, like an outer space kind of looking place.

247
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
The luxuries are just...

248
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,540
You can't even...

249
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,480
The commendations of the place are incredible.

250
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,640
That hasn't happened yet, though.

251
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,900
We're still in Tarzan's Tree Station.

252
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,200
Tarzan's radio station.

253
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,560
The floor looks...

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,900
The carpets look horrible.

255
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,380
Like they've been urinated on.

256
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
Things are sticking up.

257
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,440
The foil is coming undone.

258
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,640
It looks to me like nobody ever painted this cabin.

259
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,080
Well, that's...

260
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,880
That's because they're moving everything out of here.

261
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,420
Normally, it's high-tech.

262
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,360
They're leaving the ugly stuff.

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,120
You know, it's against the law for us to say anything bad about the station.

264
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,880
Did you know that?

265
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,480
It is now under a new Homeland Security thing.

266
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,800
But before, we could criticize with an external visa.

267
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,600
We could gripe about the microphones.

268
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,840
But that's now against the law.

269
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,260
The t-shirt Princess Wee is wearing is against the law.

270
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
It's outlawful.

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
What's inside your head is against the law.

272
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
My nose is illegal.

273
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,500
Your nose, your eyes.

274
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,460
And what's directly behind all of your eyes is illegal now.

275
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,100
Your sciences are illegal.

276
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,740
In fact, everything you're...

277
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,860
What your ears are doing right now, dear friends,

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,680
is against the laws of the United States under the new Terrorism Rave Act.

279
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,200
But remember, Barb...

280
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,780
Whereby, if you even hear somebody smoking pot,

281
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,620
you're...

282
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,200
It's a 20-year mandatory life sentence.

283
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,540
Especially on the radio.

284
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,140
And you've got to remember,

285
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,860
barbed wire does make an excellent, excellent antenna system.

286
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,060
Stang, would you like to explain a little bit how, like,

287
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,340
while incarcerated, you can still get this show

288
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,720
just by twisting the barbed wire the right way?

289
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,180
Well, if you twist it hard enough around your temples,

290
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,420
you'll hear something that sounds sort of like this show anyway.

291
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,280
It comes in through the fillings in your teeth, right?

292
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,140
If you listen to the screams of your neighboring cellmates

293
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,600
being beaten by the bulls,

294
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,100
that's sort of like listening to this show.

295
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,900
You get an idea.

296
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,660
It's about as comfortable as this show.

297
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,120
And comfortable.

298
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,740
Comforting as this show.

299
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,020
Yes.

300
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,340
How?

301
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,900
But this show wasn't meant to give comfort.

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,560
Instead, it was meant to bring alarm,

303
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,620
to cause alacrity and extreme perfunction,

304
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,700
to make people jump and shout and say,

305
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
what's it all about?

306
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,160
Well, no, actually, it was originally designed to bring slack.

307
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,580
But we learned that the best way to give people slack

308
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,120
was to beat them until... for an hour.

309
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,280
And then when we stopped beating them,

310
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,520
that's when they realized how much slack they already had.

311
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,700
And that's the moral of the story.

312
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,200
But once again, morals are not a part of this story.

313
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:32,840
No.

314
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,760
This is one of those...

315
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,280
The church of the subgenius is one of those religions

316
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,900
that doesn't let itself get bogged down in morality or ethics

317
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,860
or any of that frou-for-all.

318
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,660
Any of that frippery.

319
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,640
That's for some other religions.

320
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,460
They're welcome to all the morality they can...

321
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,440
Hack.

322
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,220
These are the religions that allow cheese in the temple,

323
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,320
that allow the perfunctory arguments of isomiasm and propiasm and propypasm.

324
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,880
These are the churches who allow...

325
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,820
belief in a single unitarian...

326
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,920
life at 2 p.m.

327
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,560
You sound like the Martian Hitler.

328
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,100
We have some Hitler coming up, by the way.

329
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,500
On Mars Invade or Tax that movie?

330
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,280
Or the Martian...

331
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,060
The leader of the Martians.

332
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,560
Or a Martian Hitler.

333
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,780
Invaders from Mars is one you're thinking of

334
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,720
that had a head in a glass jar

335
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,840
that telepathically controlled your school teacher.

336
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, what is controlling our...

337
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,640
If you don't believe that, stangy-wangy,

338
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,740
who and what is controlling our school teacher?

339
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,680
That's what I've been asking the question

340
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,860
as long as I've been asking who is Bob,

341
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,780
for crying out loud.

342
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,520
Who's controlling our stool teacher?

343
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,680
Who's controlling us?

344
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,340
The stool teachers are being controlled

345
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,860
by the signal embedded in this radio station's carrier wave.

346
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
It's not so much what you're hearing,

347
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,340
but what you don't hear that controls your brain.

348
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,340
Now, some people are laughing at that

349
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,600
and other people are going,

350
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,900
he's right, it's true,

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,100
because I went outside

352
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,540
and this helicopter, police helicopter,

353
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,900
came by just because I went outside.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,840
My friends and I, we were tripping on asses.

355
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,920
We went for a walk

356
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
and this police helicopter went right overhead

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,740
and I know it's because they're watching me,

358
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,480
they're following me.

359
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,300
I seen my neighbor across the street,

360
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,700
he was looking out his window

361
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,880
and I know it's because he was spying on me

362
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,700
for homeland security

363
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,140
and then they put that thought in my head.

364
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,180
That bad thought.

365
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,340
It wasn't my fault that I got that thought in my head.

366
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,340
It was them.

367
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,140
They did it.

368
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,140
They're planting all kinds of bad thoughts

369
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,420
in bad heads now.

370
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,180
Remember to buy smoke oil.

371
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,840
Remember to wear jeans.

372
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,320
Remember to wear cheese pants.

373
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
Remember to wear blustery whiskers.

374
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,220
Remember to buy this, buy that,

375
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,860
do this, do that.

376
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,560
Oh, your mind is not controlled.

377
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,180
There's no mind of yours to control.

378
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,620
You have no mind of your own.

379
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
Well, a while back,

380
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,980
the conspiracy used to control your mind,

381
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,940
but then they...

382
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,780
Wait a minute, I'm almost done.

383
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,320
They don't have...

384
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,000
No longer is there anyone working for the conspiracy

385
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
who has a mind.

386
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,540
No one has a mind, mind you,

387
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,540
at this point.

388
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,900
Except the conspiracy,

389
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,280
because they have a plan.

390
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
That's the problem.

391
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't mind.

392
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,580
Does it concern...

393
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,540
Well, but their plan is 50 years old,

394
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,020
and it's getting kind of, you know, touchy.

395
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,280
It tells the same jokes every week.

396
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,720
But, Stank, think of all the world's religions

397
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
and corporations and governments.

398
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,780
Aren't they telling them same old 200-year-old

399
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,320
stinky, stinky old jokes?

400
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,700
They only have to tell it once,

401
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,100
and the corruptigating worm is in your head.

402
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,800
Literally eating his way in through your corpus callosum,

403
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
into your...

404
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,640
into your midbrain.

405
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,600
It's delicious!

406
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, some people's are probably delicious.

407
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,840
I don't know that I'd want to crack your head open

408
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,180
and sup of your grey matter,

409
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,500
because it really is grey.

410
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,780
It's supposed to be pink,

411
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,740
but I've seen your brain, Dave.

412
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,220
It's a little stinky in there.

413
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,560
It's one big cell.

414
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,240
It's one large brain cell.

415
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,940
And with one large convict

416
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,260
walking around aimlessly,

417
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,480
left to right,

418
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,520
crossing himself with indignity,

419
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,100
walking up to the outside,

420
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,140
going too close to the mirror.

421
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,920
Don't stand too close to the mirror!

422
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,980
Get by the bars.

423
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,880
Get back away.

424
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,180
Get back away from the bars!

425
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,060
Princess, we and I only have

426
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,860
a half a brain cell each,

427
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,980
but it's a joint brain.

428
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,120
Together.

429
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,420
And when we rub those two halves together,

430
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,580
synapses can fire

431
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,120
and actual thoughts can happen.

432
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,400
I wish that would happen now.

433
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,480
Me too.

434
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,320
Don't worry.

435
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,080
There's a doctor made for...

436
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,660
for you today.

437
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,080
With MedService Incorporated,

438
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,360
any and every ethical or emergency

439
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
you might experience

440
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,540
is completely and totally irrelevant.

441
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,160
Alright, no idea.

442
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,320
What I was trying to say is

443
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,740
we need a form of spiritual doctor.

444
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,380
We need a doctor that is more like a medicine man.

445
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,460
A doctor who has his patient's heart at heart.

446
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,100
A doctor who understands everything

447
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,540
a doctor must understand.

448
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,000
Except for I have to go play golf right now.

449
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,840
And I have to play this right now.

450
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,420
If I lost the weight,

451
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,940
my knees would stop hurting.

452
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,760
Ask your doctor about stomach injury, vomiting and heartburn

453
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,640
to help you achieve long-term weight loss.

454
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,000
Hmm, what are you eating?

455
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,680
We're all growing old

456
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,040
Hope these words will console

457
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,300
While we're here stretch out the years with time control

458
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,320
Don't try to hold

459
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,240
Just let it go

460
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,880
Everything happens eventually

461
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,140
With time control

462
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Time control

463
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,000
Time control

464
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,180
Time control

465
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,840
Time control

466
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,820
Time control

467
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,100
Time control

468
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,300
Time control

469
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


470
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


471
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


472
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


473
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


474
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


475
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


476
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


477
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


478
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


479
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,300


480
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:38,660
The temple of controle

481
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,060
Time control

482
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,740
Why time is such a waste

483
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,440
Everything around it is driving people

484
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Ooh, time is such a waste

485
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,120


486
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,920
Time Control

487
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,420
Everything happening at once

488
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,200
A future like the past

489
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,360
Will soon be gone

490
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,620
Right now

491
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,560
A present

492
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,300
Ready to unwrap

493
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,000
Every day's a holiday

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,380
When you've got slack

495
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,480
Time stops

496
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,080
Everything happening at once

497
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,900
A future like the past

498
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,020
Will soon be gone

499
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,320
Right now

500
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,280
A present

501
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,940
Ready to unwrap

502
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,720
Every day's a holiday

503
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,840
When you've got

504
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,400
Patience

505
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Time Control

506
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,100
Control

507
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,840
Patience

508
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,400
Time Control

509
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,340
Like old times

510
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,200
You and I didn't have any old times

511
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,320
Like old time, you and I didn't have any old time spot.

512
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,180
Like old time, you and I didn't have any old time spot.

513
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,720
No.

514
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,020
Like old time, you and I didn't have any old time spot.

515
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,120
No.

516
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,180
But from now on we can.

517
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:07,180
Like old time, you and I didn't have any old time spot.

518
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:50,280
Like old time, you and I didn't have any old time spot.

519
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:02,320
The great Reverend Phineas Narco, and you can hear his whole shows if you look at nationalcynical.com.

520
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:09,460
In fact, he'll be, and he streams a lot of stuff for those listening in real time.

521
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
He'll be streaming at 10 o'clock tonight.

522
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,740
But most of you aren't listening in real time.

523
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,940
But some may.

524
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,160
You have no time control.

525
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,600
Do you need time control?

526
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,480
Time control was by Reverend Max.

527
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,420
Slack.

528
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,640
We've been playing a lot of songs by Max Slack, and there's a lot more of them yet to come.

529
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,720
As he is known to his comrades, Max Slack.

530
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,140
I'm sorry.

531
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Max Slack.

532
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,260
Max Slack.

533
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,860
Max Schnell.

534
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,800
Hi, folks.

535
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,960
I'm Max Schnell with the Max Schnell Report.

536
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,880
And there's so much to say, I can't say it quick enough, so.

537
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,300
Max Schnell means faster.

538
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,640
Go faster, doesn't it?

539
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,520
Yes, make quick.

540
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,000
The only reason I know that is because that's what Hitler's brain says.

541
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,100
As in, they stole Hitler's brain.

542
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,360
He does say Max Schnell.

543
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,180
They carry a little Hitler head around in a basket, and it's always going, Max Schnell, Max Schnell.

544
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,080
And it also gives commands on how to take over the world and stuff, right?

545
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah.

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,840
Or something like that.

547
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,680
I've never actually seen that movie.

548
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,440
I've only heard takeoffs on it.

549
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:20,280
Now, is it true that there's a little jar with Philo Drummond's head in it that's going around telling everybody all kinds of, I don't know, what not, what to do.

550
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
It's more like, well, yeah, right.

551
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah, Philo has a jar.

552
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,540
What not to do.

553
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,100
What not to do.

554
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,100


555
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,300
What not to do.

556
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,880
Philo has a jar with the Philo head in it, but we all have a little jar with Hitler's head inside our head.

557
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,860
I have one in my breast pocket right now, and believe me, it's close to my heart.

558
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,160
It's making my nipple very, very feisty.

559
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,860
Everyone has a tiny little Hitler in there, inside their head, trying to come out.

560
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,620
This is happening.

561
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:52,260
I'm not saying that's a good thing, but that's what the conspiracy is all about, my friends.

562
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,200
The tiny Hitler inside everybody's head.

563
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:03,780
And all the con has to do is sit back and let that little Hitler do its business.

564
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,960
What is the purpose of the little Hitler in the head?

565
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,360
Is it to make the trains run on time, so to speak, and the individual personality?

566
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,860
Is it more or less to make us dress up funny in uniforms or to grow a little mustache like Charlie Chaplin and wave like, hello?

567
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,700
It's to make you want to be the big boss.

568
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,120
The big boss of your area.

569
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,040
That's what the little Hitler head is for.

570
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,280
It's an evolutionary thing.

571
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,980
My area's been in need of a big boss for a long time, you know what I'm saying?

572
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,200
Well, some people's Hitler head is really small, and some people have a great big Hitler head.

573
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,980
So that doesn't have to do with the actual length or the size of the, so to speak, Hitler.

574
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,020
This is an inner head thing, Dave.

575
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,060
It's not something that you could find circulating in a sideshow.

576
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,680
Everyone else is.

577
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,580
It also has a tiny Mother Teresa inside their heads.

578
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:05,320
It's miserable and sick to its own heart, because even though it has to act like it's godly and doing all this stuff for God,

579
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,640
in fact, it doesn't really believe, and it's faking it.

580
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,900
Wow.

581
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,860
You know, that's what, it turned out that Mother Teresa was faking it for the whole last half of her life.

582
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,160
She lost her faith, and she wrote letters to this one.

583
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:28,240
One friend who, ten years after she died or whatever it was, he decided to go ahead and release these letters and go,

584
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:37,920
here's how miserable she really was, because she hated having to go through the motions and pretend that she was this little godly nun,

585
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,800
when really she didn't, she had given up.

586
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,420
She had no hope.

587
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,680
She needed Bob.

588
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,560
Mother Teresa needed a great big old Bob.

589
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,540
Right behind her.

590
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,280
Right in the, you know, where it's.

591
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,360
Well, I was wondering.

592
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,300
Do we each have like a.

593
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,760
I could have helped out Mother Teresa.

594
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,860
A number of these little, little, little heads.

595
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,980
I'll show her my little Hitler.

596
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,700
None of this is happening.

597
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,640
None of it.

598
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,080
Now, some people want to show her their little Elvis, but I don't even have a little Elvis.

599
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,100
All I've got is two little Hitlers.

600
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,400
So, like, if you're an average bowling alley type guy, you know, you come home from work, you drink 12 six-packs of beer,

601
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,920
you run around and chase the little children in the neighborhood, stuff like that.

602
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,620
Okay.

603
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,340
All right.

604
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,280
You're a Brown supporter.

605
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
You're a Cleveland Indian supporter, so forth.

606
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,700
Now, you've got a little one, two, three, four, like five different little heads in here.

607
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,820
You've got your little Hitler head.

608
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,660
You've got your little Mother Teresa head.

609
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,340
You've got a little John Wayne head.

610
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,620
You've got your little John.

611
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,640
You've got your little Woody Allen head.

612
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,220
You've got to have your little Woody Allen head, right?

613
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:32,660
Right.

614
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,780
Something like that.

615
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,140
Telling you, like, what am I doing this for?

616
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,840
This is wrong.

617
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,340
You know.

618
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,040
A few people have a little Jimi Hendrix head.

619
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,880
Oh, man.

620
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,120
That's the head I'd like to have in my little head.

621
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:49,140
Everybody wishes they had the Jimi Hendrix head, but everybody does have the Hitler head, unfortunately.

622
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,180
And you've got.

623
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,980
You've got to work to cast out that Hitler.

624
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,240
You've got to plunge your finger down your throat and vomit that up.

625
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,220
I would say just to not only, just to not give in to the Hitler head.

626
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't hile back.

627
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,680
Don't salute.

628
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,100
Don't wear those funny clothes.

629
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,020
Get other people to do that.

630
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,300
March out of step is what I would say.

631
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,340
March out of step.

632
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,080
And I would say decry all authority for its lunacy.

633
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,220
Decry.

634
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
What good advice.

635
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,300
I think that's actually quite good.

636
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,800
Well, geez, thanks, Wee.

637
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
That kind of makes me perpendicular.

638
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,540
That's wonderful.

639
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,360
I like that.

640
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,300
I really like that.

641
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,660
Mr. Fernandanande Lemur did the collages that we've heard tonight, by the way.

642
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,040
I think this is almost all Lemurian collage-y show.

643
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,080
They look like prairie dogs, don't they, Lemurs?

644
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820
No, you're thinking meerkats.

645
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,320
Meerkats.

646
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,820
Yeah.

647
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,540
Meerkats.

648
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,020
Princess Wee and I have a.

649
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,140
A great love of meerkats.

650
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:59,360
We've watched them in the wild, in the zoo, and they have this sort of slackful aura about

651
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,740
them.

652
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,400
They do.

653
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,780
They don't really care that much about them.

654
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,280
They stand like this.

655
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,060
Prissy hands.

656
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,640
With their hands hanging down pristly.

657
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,440
I've seen many hermaphroditic subgenies.

658
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
My kids make fun of me for doing this.

659
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,720
When I'm in repose, I sometimes will take a meerkat pose.

660
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
It makes me feel.

661
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
Like I have slack.

662
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,140
Like you ever.

663
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,800
It helps subdue the little Hitler.

664
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,940
There's a vast repository of strength in your energy deposing that little Hitler.

665
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,480
It brings out the big old Bob in my head.

666
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,400
Now, see, that's the thing.

667
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,720
Everybody's also got a.

668
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:40,000
If you're a subgenius minister, along with all this clutter of Hitlers and Mother Teresa's and Elvis's and things,

669
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,180
you also get, for the first time, a big old Bob.

670
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,820
Well, it's not a big old Bob at first.

671
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,980
It's a little baby Bob.

672
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,580
It's kind of flaccid.

673
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,240
Oh, they grow fast.

674
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,340
Yeah.

675
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,340


676
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,540
They grow fast.

677
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,760
They don't grow much, but they grow fast.

678
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,220
Like wildfire.

679
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,460
It's kind of like a chia seed or something.

680
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,420
You just, like, rub it a little bit and put some milk there, and it explodes in your face.

681
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,800
Speaking of growing fast, have I mentioned to our live audience that I'm a grandpa now?

682
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,400
You can call me Peepaw.

683
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,340
Peepaw Stan.

684
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,300
Peepaw is your nickname?

685
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,060
And Meemaw.

686
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,760
Weemaw.

687
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,860
That's Weemaw.

688
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,280
Princess We is Weemaw.

689
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,220
And actually, I'm D-Daw, I think.

690
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,840
I'll end up being whatever the little.

691
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,940
The little Stang will.

692
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,740
Only it's my daughter's kid, and she married somebody else, so his last name is not Stang.

693
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,240
Well, how could you do such a thing?

694
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,120
And I'm not going to say his last name, because then you could look up where they live in Wasilla, Alaska, and find them.

695
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,380
Well, my new Ninos call me Yee for Yee Old Man.

696
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
They call you what?

697
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,320
Yee.

698
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,820
The?

699
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,900
Yee.

700
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,540
Yee.

701
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,040
Yee.

702
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,460
For Yee Old Man.

703
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,200
Yee Old Man.

704
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,140
Yonder Old Man.

705
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,140
Yonder Yee.

706
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,000
Yee Old Man.

707
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,060
Yee.

708
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,260
Yee.

709
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,820
And I wear, like, medieval fair frocks and stuff like that around my frame.

710
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,000
You could be, like, Prince Yee.

711
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,780
Prince Yee.

712
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,720
Sharing the microphone with Princess Wee.

713
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,180
Yee and Wee.

714
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,300
Yee and Wee.

715
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,960
And Zee.

716
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:18,320
You know, no matter how often we say on the show her name properly, Princess Wee Ardo, Queen of All the UFOs,

717
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,860
there remain people who insist on calling her Princess Wee.

718
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,200
And I just don't get that.

719
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,520
The Wee is not Chinese.

720
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,460
It's Wee as in Wee!

721
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,360
Maybe you guys should spell it W-H-E-E.

722
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,480
Or just forget about all that Hitler in your head stuff and spell it any damn way you please.

723
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,160
I fawn all over that dough no matter how you look at it.

724
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,740
Ah.

725
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,160
Bucko.

726
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,760
Isn't that sweet?

727
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,860
You beat me to the snout.

728
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,540
You're giving me a personal summer.

729
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,020
That's the little Cary Grant head inside my brain.

730
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,220
A personal summer?

731
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,580
What the hell's a personal summer?

732
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,700
A hot flash.

733
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh.

734
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,220
I see.

735
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,100
Yes.

736
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,300
Friends.

737
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,160
I've been on the beach too long.

738
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,380
Friends.

739
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:04,900
I've dried.

740
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,860
In the glow of.

741
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,540
I've been looking for mollusks and coquina shells for a long time.

742
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,340
Do you know where I could find meat on this seashore?

743
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,220
Is that what that smell is?

744
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
You know, we are going.

745
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,000
Some of these coquina are bad like my breath.

746
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,840
Oh my.

747
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:28,240
According to the prognostications that I read all the time in the conspiracy news,

748
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,780
it appears that we all will be wandering the lake shore looking for food soon

749
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,620
and eating little growth clusters and so forth.

750
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Anything we can get our hands on because everything will cost too much.

751
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Milk will be the price of gas and gas will be the price of diamonds.

752
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,540
And diamonds will.

753
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Be free because they're useless.

754
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
They're just pretty shiny.

755
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,940
Cut glass with them.

756
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,440
That's about it.

757
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,900
I remember the elder statesman Dennis Kucinich, who was is from Cleveland area, said in the

758
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,800
70s in a Playboy interview, which I could never mind.

759
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,440
But in a Playboy interview, he said that by the time gas is five dollars a gallon.

760
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,640
By the time gas is five dollars a gallon and bread is two dollars a loaf.

761
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,580
There's going to be people in the street.

762
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,120
So we got to do something about this because we don't want because there's going to be.

763
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,840
And he didn't understand that people don't even care about their own selves.

764
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:36,000
My son, about ten years ago, sort of at one point I was talking about the cost of making a movie or buying something.

765
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,000
He rolled his eyes.

766
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,180
He goes, Dad, you need to start adding a zero to everything.

767
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
That's the way it is now, man.

768
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,640
No.

769
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,080
Now you have to add two zeros.

770
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,440
Right.

771
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,840
One in front to show that.

772
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:45,920
That's right.

773
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,600
Mill sub data, meaning nothing equals nothing.

774
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Plus nothing.

775
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,360
Nada.

776
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,480
He not a.

777
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Not a.

778
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,080
Not a.

779
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,400
Not a.

780
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,680
Not a.

781
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,900
Not a.

782
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,040
Not a.

783
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,980
And also you could put a you could put a zero underneath, which they call the smiling goose egg in theoretical mathematics.

784
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,680
When you put the little zero under and calculus, it means nothing.

785
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,780
There ain't never, ever going to be nothing more than net.

786
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,100
And then you put it up on top, which I guess is the sun.

787
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:12,640
God.

788
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,160
Zero.

789
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,120
Which means.

790
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,820
Who gives?

791
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,160
Who gives?

792
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,860
Because.

793
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,320
Never mind.

794
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:18,980
It's.

795
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm sorry.

796
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,900
I diluted the track.

797
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,360
Who invented the zero?

798
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,260
Was it the Persians or.

799
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,240
The Arabs.

800
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,360
The what?

801
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,620
The Arab in the Middle East.

802
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,360
The autobots?

803
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,380
The Arab in the Middle East was the.

804
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,560
It wasn't the Decepticons.

805
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,980
Was originally nine.

806
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,020
And then they used the ten.

807
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,900
Make it go to ten.

808
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,880
At least that's what they say down.

809
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,400
They say 11 down the street from me.

810
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:44,620
Oh.

811
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,920
We invented mathematics.

812
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,300
Astrology.

813
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,560
I mean, astronomy and medicine.

814
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,620
And.

815
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,880
The guy down at the 7-Eleven down the street from you invented medicine, astrology and

816
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,600
astronomy and the zero?

817
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,260
Yep.

818
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,180
Of course, the zero has to do with more with the mathematics than it does with astrology.

819
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,280
Even though I was born under the sign of the sub nil dot.

820
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,720
Well, now.

821
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,480
So I guess that happened at a time when our ancestors.

822
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,600
Yeah.

823
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,860
The mighty Caucasians were still chucking spears out of caves, right?

824
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,060
And painting themselves blue.

825
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,360
Or as they used to say in the pub scrolls in London, the Irish had a culture when you

826
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,400
Brits were picking your noses in caves.

827
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,780
That's what at least they used to say that in the urinals.

828
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,560
Oh.

829
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,200
Anyway, I'm sorry I drifted away there for a minute, but I.

830
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,040
Well, I thought the Chinese invented everything.

831
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,580
Well, they did invent running toilets, cold water, flood.

832
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,380
The modern brassier, as we know, without the extra opiates and the things that shoot

833
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,080
in the dark.

834
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,620
Onions, I think dark meat.

835
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,020
Who invented work?

836
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,620
I'd like to kill that guy.

837
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,800
We're going to have to kill him pretty soon.

838
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,480
Yeah.

839
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,280
Actually, I was reading that work was invented about the same time as agriculture.

840
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,180
So you could sort of blame Sumerians or somebody like that.

841
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,560
I'd rather blame Johnny Rockefeller because he came up with the idea of eight hours a

842
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:14,560


843
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:14,660
day.

844
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,920
Eight hours working, eight hours sleeping, and eight hours for you to pretend like you're

845
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,340
with your family being yourself.

846
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:20,780
Right.

847
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,100
Right.

848
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,480
Blame it on the need for vegetables.

849
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,960
Eight hours to.

850
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,800
The need of vegetables.

851
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,580
I have the vegetables.

852
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,400
This is the agricultural age.

853
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,240
We're worshiping the great god of celery.

854
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,660
The great god of celery would like to introduce himself, so he'll come right up to the microphone

855
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,540
and tell us what he's new for us in the age of agriculture.

856
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,540


857
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,460
It's Bob.

858
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
You must satisfy.

859
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,280
Well, I see a modern celery.

860
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,380
I stalk people.

861
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,180
Oh boy, I should have stayed at my own place, whatever that is.

862
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,020
What is my place?

863
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,480
Don't ever stay at your own place.

864
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,740
We need you here.

865
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,740
Before you can go to your place, Dave, you must learn your place.

866
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,000
But is it a supine position or is it just like an overlord?

867
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,020
It's doggy style.

868
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,500
Kind of like a suppository.

869
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,380
But I'm the one.

870
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm the dog, right?

871
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,780
In other words.

872
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,260
That's right.

873
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,580
I'm the one on the bottom.

874
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,120
You're the bitch.

875
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,140
The biatch.

876
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, you're my little biatch, baby.

877
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,060
You're Bob's little biatch, not mine.

878
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,540
None of it.

879
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,160
None of it at all.

880
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,740
I'm Bob's little biatch.

881
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,140
It's not happening.

882
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,720
Biatch is the correct cool pronunciation as I understand it.

883
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,260
Well, there's also biotch and ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-batch.

884
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,580
There's...

885
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,120
You know, because I don't really watch TV or listen to the radio, this show is the only

886
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,960
show that I ever see.

887
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,960
It's the constantly evolving or devolving biotch.

888
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,460
Biotch.

889
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,460


890
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,480
How do you say it on the internet?

891
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,400
Something like that.

892
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,140
How do you say that on the internet?

893
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,740
That's the way my gerbil says it.

894
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,960
But you have, there's like ultra, there's like a lot of diphthongs and vowel movements that

895
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:13,940
go up and down.

896
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,540
All the way back to like, I don't know, what's some vowel shifts, not vowel movements.

897
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,820
Oh, there's some, but we're old.

898
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,380
And we use vowels and consonants that are extinct, basically.

899
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,340
We're the last users of many vocal sounds.

900
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,600
Look at these clothes, too, with like these little shields on the breasts.

901
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,320
You know, we look like the Valhalla women, you know, the Viking women.

902
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Outdated, obsolete, old, old, old, old.

903
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,660
Tin shoes.

904
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,140
Shoes.

905
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,320
Grandpas.

906
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Great, great grandpas.

907
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:54,200
People without cluster, without feelings, without social energy, without emotions, without ears, nostrils, or...

908
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,480
Old, old, old.

909
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,120
No passion whatsoever.

910
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:05,560
People who just as soon float downstream as swim frantically upstream, only to be taken away into the rapids.

911
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,140
And the whole clan was taken away.

912
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,900
Well, actually, the...

913
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,800
They're all...

914
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
The rewardians float...

915
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,940
They float downstream, and the emergentiles swim against the current.

916
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,580
And, uh, you rewardians just be glad that we only take one out of ten of you.

917
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,720
But only the twain shall meet.

918
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,520
Many, many, many rewardians are with those others.

919
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:40,280
But we of Procrustinium shall be rewarded best and last, for we have waited the longest.

920
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,020
Yes, friends.

921
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,640
Procrustinium.

922
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,280
Procrustinium shall be...

923
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,700
You say you have ranked the longest?

924
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,780
Dominant again.

925
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,880
The Procrustinians.

926
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:56,000
We have put off our glory enough times that it damn well better happen very soon.

927
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,960
No.

928
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,840
Because I get really tired of waiting.

929
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,420
Bob, oh, Bob.

930
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,740
Wherefore art thou, Bob?

931
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,980
Oh, Bob, please.

932
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,280
As your humble servant, I would ask that you...

933
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, see, I forgot this homily here.

934
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,080
I can't...

935
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:12,940
I'm on one.

936
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,520
Let's see.

937
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,760
Oh, this is...

938
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:26,160
Dear Bob, as your humble servant, I would like to remind you that a contract is as goodly as good as the keeper of its various worms.

939
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:35,220
You, for instance, Mr. Snavely Mean Wretched Person, have denied me my rights as a fellow Hunan being,

940
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,140
as a member of the County Club,

941
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,100
and a flipper of the agenda.

942
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,460
Wait.

943
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,820
It is for these reasons that my lawyer, or legal staff, has...

944
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,340
Oh, shit.

945
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,880
This is the wrong...

946
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,000
Burgermeisters.

947
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,560
Oh, when was the last time you slayed a Burgermeister?

948
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,160
When was the last time you sniffed a Burgermot?

949
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,640
Isn't it more frequent for you, friend, that the Burgermeister riles up the vineyard?

950
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,960
You know, when you're a villager and they come after you with torches.

951
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,820
The Burgermeister keeps you regular.

952
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,480
And he's always there on the corner with his finger where it belongs.

953
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,860
Don't just slay that Burgermeister.

954
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,440
Slay the hell out of him.

955
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,360
Don't just...

956
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,840
Bob said that.

957
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,820
...choke that chicken.

958
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,360
Batter dip in.

959
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,300
Deep fry it.

960
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,300
And then batter it again.

961
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,300


962
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,260
Wank as if your very life depended upon it.

963
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,480
And it does, my friend.

964
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,640
You know, Priestess Pisces is...

965
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:48,220
She's the head of the wankers for Bob Schism.

966
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,740
Yeah!

967
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,980
You can say that, right?

968
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,740
Yeah!

969
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,040
Listen, man, that beheads the socialism.

970
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,500
Because I saw all these years talking to them three guys.

971
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,780
The one with the weird, like, this-sized, huge eyes.

972
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,180
And the ones with very...

973
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,220
The ears like St. Bernard dogs.

974
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,000
And the ones who could...

975
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,500
They dreamed there was a fowl...

976
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,800
And a thousand gold pieces under that one tree.

977
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,440
And they hung somebody there.

978
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,340
And she's a damn socialism!

979
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,080
Because I can smell it!

980
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,940
Don't you be bad-mouthing that, Princess Pisces.

981
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,700
Don't you ever bad-mouth her!

982
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,040
Man, don't you know what she didn't do?

983
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,260
It's not what she...

984
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,000
I didn't...

985
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,120
There's something fishy about her.

986
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,880
Ah, yeah.

987
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,840
Fresh, fresh fish.

988
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,420
Come on, man.

989
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,200
Sister fish.

990
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,400
Oh!

991
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,280
You're a fish, too.

992
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,520
I'm a fish, too!

993
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,180
I'm all peshy.

994
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,220
That's true.

995
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,380
I have scales, but I...

996
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,200
But, Princess Wee, you were not actually born of this Earth.

997
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,320
So, would the constellations and the stars have the same effect on some...

998
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,660
You don't even know which planet you were from yet.

999
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,980
That's exactly right.

1000
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,280
But I tend to favor the princess...

1001
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,100
The Pisces.

1002
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,040
Piscean.

1003
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,460
By Piscean of the Earth.

1004
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,960
The pesky Pisces.

1005
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,880
Remember that old joke?

1006
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,820
You were born under the sign Yield.

1007
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,220
Or Stop.

1008
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,060
The sign...

1009
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,700
You were born under the sign of Stop?

1010
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,840
Or Yield.

1011
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,400
Yield.

1012
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,920
Yeah, I...

1013
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,380
I think it's...

1014
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,300
Oh, my.

1015
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,920
I think it's time to warn them again.

1016
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,640
Time for the news.

1017
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,440
Time for the news in Washington.

1018
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,440
I'm near 90 miles per hour.

1019
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,340
Democratic presidential candidate,

1020
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,240
Barack Obama,

1021
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,540
made a sexist comment about Republican presidential candidate,

1022
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,460
John McCain's,

1023
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,320
for phony outrage.

1024
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,880
We have real diversions in this country right now.

1025
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,840
And the American people are looking to us for distractions.

1026
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,900
They want manipulations, not answers.

1027
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,800
Investment company Lehman Brothers says

1028
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,680
the McCain campaign made the same remark earlier this year

1029
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,620
regarding the largest and most expensive giant particle ever attempted.

1030
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,080
In the coming months,

1031
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,460
the plan is to smash physicists into each other.

1032
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,340
The hope is that...

1033
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,040
Enormous particles will be created.

1034
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,400
Particles 17 miles around.

1035
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,380
Also, an unusual particle called PR News.

1036
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,500
Tall as a three-story building.

1037
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,420
On Wall Street 672-19-8,

1038
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,120
this is PR News in Washington.

1039
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,100
We'll be right back.

1040
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,600
So please just stay your wife.

1041
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,680
Work in a graveyard shift.

1042
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,780
Work in a graveyard shift.

1043
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,980
Work in a graveyard shift.

1044
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,080
Work in a graveyard shift.

1045
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,600
Work in a graveyard shift.

1046
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,600


1047
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,600


1048
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,600


1049
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,100
I'm standing in white light.

1050
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,200
I have no clue to help me through.

1051
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,400
So please let's take the night.

1052
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,500
Work in a graveyard shift.

1053
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,600
Work in a graveyard shift.

1054
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,760
Work in the graveyard shit

1055
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,860
Work in the graveyard shit

1056
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,800
That I'm working

1057
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,380
That I'm working

1058
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,800
More things in heaven and earth than in your books

1059
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:54,420
More things in heaven and earth than your books

1060
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,000
I was working the graveyard shit late one Sunday night

1061
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,140
Making sure all the trains were running smooth and uptight

1062
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,900
Keeping a close eye on the backbeat in four and nine

1063
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,360
Making sure all the trains were running smooth and uptight

1064
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,860
Making sure all the trains were running on time

1065
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,240
Then I lucked off into the cold distance and what did I see?

1066
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,420
Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

1067
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,720
One solitary headlight with his eyes on me

1068
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,540
Come and take me away

1069
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,740
Come and take me away

1070
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,900
Come and take me away

1071
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,820
Come and take me away

1072
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,900
Work in the graveyard shit

1073
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,060
Work in the graveyard shit

1074
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,220
Work in the graveyard shit

1075
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,300
Work in the graveyard shit

1076
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,420
Ah

1077
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,240
Ah

1078
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,780
Oh

1079
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,120

1097
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,740
A song by Professor Chaz Smith

That's Dave on guitar

1100
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,380
In fact, it's been Dave on guitar all night

1101
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,120
Believe it or not

1102
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,320

1108
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,420
I'd like to have you know this

1109
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,160
Mosick, yes

1110
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,980
But it might be pronounced different

1111
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,900
and actually mean something

1112
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,060
else

1113
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,600

is a big part of that

1116
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,040
Now her name does not mean brain

1117
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,300
It means George

1118
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,620
Right

1119
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,840
What does Michelle mean?

1120
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,160

Oh

1123
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,140

1124
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,000
Michelle, let me get in there

1125
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,460

And Reverend Princess X

1138
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:24,340
Well, there was a Dr. X who was one of the co-sub-founders of the church

1139
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,260
He wanted to call it the Church of the Divine Immaculation

1140
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,780
Well, he missed the first Purge, though

1141

1144
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:33,860


1145
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:39,740
he purged himself oh he did yes he did accidentally he didn't mean to but you know that's what happens

1146
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:45,220
when you go to thailand and buy heroin oh i thought he tried to demaculate himself like

00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,940
bob and fried his little testicles oh he did do that first we all did that probably over and over

1157
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,800
your state the squares coming off your cerebrus your corpus

1158
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,720
cerebrus was it

1159
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,800
the guard of the dam didn't he the devils the demons are the damned or haiti's or

1160
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:11,920
now when i was uh 20 i thought 30 was old and when when i was 30 i thought 50 was

1161
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:19,240
really really old now i'm 55 and i think i still think 50 is old so that means i think

1162
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,100
like a 30 year old yeah but when i was five i thought 10 was really really super old and then

1163
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,780
when i got when i was 12 years old i thought everyone who was 10 was really young and stupid

1164
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,200
right

1165
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,400
when i well i knew i stopped right there at 12 and he decided i would never ever ever in the rest

1166
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,660
of my life become an older person or a younger person any more than that when i the numbers i

1167
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:47,460
was given my daughter swore to me that she would always be nine years old but she lied i was just

1168
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:53,200
talking with a friend today who said that under it all most men are just about 12 and i said some

1169
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,920
aren't so under it all dear you know what that means it means we don't have to wear all those

1170
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,800
weird tampons and we don't have to wear all those weird tampons and we don't have to wear all those

1171
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,440
weird tampons and we don't have to wear all those weird tampons and we don't have to wear all those

1172
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:06,960
funny things every month they wear their 12 year oldness proudly i'd rather wear my pre-pubescence

1173
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,840
than a bunch of funny girdles and arm pants that nobody else can wear well good then it's viva la

1174
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:21,320
difference you wear diapers at the beginning and you wear them at the end that is really profound

1175
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,940
staying in true but unfortunately you put on your diapers this morning who's going to change them

1176
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,060
tonight my friend

1177
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,320
she is the undertaker going to be changing your diapers tonight

1178
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:42,220
what is with with this black morbid humor tonight i mean come off it it's in the air

1179
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,860
lovey love i think everyone's thinking of their own mortality a little bit especially since bob

1180
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:52,920
took the tumble last week i mean it was quite a surprise to most of us seeing that he would never

1181
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:59,540
ever wake up again i mean have the pipe so far stuck up there wasn't it we couldn't get it out

1182
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:05,120
we couldn't know you can't we could you can't not for love or money can you extract that pipe from

1183
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,860
bob's you know ever ever and so they and if you did pull it out it'd probably be the end of time

1184
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:17,140
right a premature end of time all entangled with his brain right so when you pull the pipe out his

1185
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,120
whole brain comes out it right the tappers go all the way into the brain so when we took him to

1186
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,020
hospital we were after we were trying to be very careful that they knew exactly that if they began

1187
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,480
to unravel

1188
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:34,700
the great secret so to speak there might not be any more dark meat left for the rest of us

1189
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:42,540
we're talking about dark matter uh you know well you have to have that as a and there has to be a

1190
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:47,820
pipe on both ends that's the funny thing about bob most people don't know but there's a pipe on

1191
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:53,520
either end there's the front pipe that everybody sees and then there's the nether pipe also known

1192
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,220
as the back pipe or the tailpipe i read an article though uh i read an article just today

1193
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,720
about the

1194
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:05,740
evolution of the anus it has come a long way in the last few million years well there was a time

1195
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:12,140
when every there was one orifice that did the job of both mouth and anus in in organ organisms

1196
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:21,220
and uh and then later latar the uh the flatworm or some some brilliant creature like that

1197
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:29,140
eventually punched a hole out the other side break he broke on through to the other side

1198
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,600
so

1199
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:36,000
this mono mono cell creature was the first uh nether piper no not a single cell creature they

1200
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,560
actually have a vacuole that will uh erp out they just kind of pass waste out their sides you might

1201
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,140
so you're saying in the old days sort of like frank sinatra we would take the food in and blow

1202
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,940
the waste all over your whole body so your whole body would take the food in and blow the refuse

1203
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,820
no you had there well yeah that was in the original then they developed the mouth and

1204
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,800
but for a while it ended in a coma and then they developed the mouth and then they developed the mouth

1205
00:55:59,800 --> 00:55:59,820
and then they developed the mouth and then they developed the mouth and then they developed the mouth

1206
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,940
as a cul-de-sac oh right like some of them had teeth in their anus and that was considered well

1207
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,280
we're going to have problems well they had to rewrite the whole formula right they had to

1208
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,560
rewrite the whole formula and uh and to and that's why most of the creatures that crawl or flop on

1209
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,880
this planet are have a hole right through their middle we're donut shaped really if you think

1210
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,680
about it if you think there's there's a hole that just goes all the way through now some of us

1211
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,740
and there's it gets it gets stopped up sometimes right that's why some of us can get clawed

1212
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,820
do have a vestigial anal tooth still uh a small vestigial right you know it's like a some right

1213
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,420
underneath a little bit of a monkey tail right my mom had one of those little monkey tails did you

1214
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,280
know that i didn't know it curled up not a whole tail i mean you told me that i didn't know it

1215
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,580
stuck up so far and it was so curly i i thought you were fooling me at first and uh my brother

1216
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:59,320
later has extra nipples supernumerary nipula you might say nipuli

1217
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,320
extra nipples yeah they're not productive though you can't do anything with them if you were like a

1218
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,740
little hitler in someone's head uh wouldn't you urge them chromosomically and genetically to grow

1219
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,480
more nipples just for the sake of the fatherland well it's to offset the lack of testicles with

1220
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:24,300
which hitler and other great men only had one are all the sub nipples as uh stimulatable or is it

1221
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,600
just do they all have sensitivity or just the one by great by the way i don't mean

1222
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,380
good i mean large you mean like greater and lesser like some of them have more they're all

1223
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,960
i didn't want to i didn't want to go on record as saying hitler was great i'm not saying that

1224
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:46,120
he was grating his voice was most grating oh speaking of grating it's a great time to
