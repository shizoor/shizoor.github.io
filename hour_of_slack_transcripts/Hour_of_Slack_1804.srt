1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,800
Sometimes I speak English, sometimes I don't.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,980
You were outside my house yesterday.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,260
You frightened my wife.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,740
What do you want?

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,060
Who are you?

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,080
Who are you?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,260
What?

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,900
Who are you?

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,820
Who are you?

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,580
Are you a fish?

11
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,300
Are you a fish?

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,340
No.

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,200
Are you a snake?

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,700
Are you a man?

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Who are you?

16
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,820
Who are you?

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,800
Who are you?

18
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,140
Who are you?

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,120
Who are you?

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,140
Who are you?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,580
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Are you Nurgle?

23
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,440
Yes.

24
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,280
The subgenius powerhouse.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,680
One of the worst moments you may ever experience.

26
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,940
Yes, it is.

27
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,320
How come?

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Let's go sit down, talk this over.

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,160
From NPR News in Washington, I'm unlikely to endanger residents.

30
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,500
The White House has President Trump.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Tuesday.

32
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,240
But, quote, quote, the U.S. government has favorable PR news.

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,720
Organic peroxides are used to make PR news.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,940
And we expect these products will ignite at some point in the coming days.

35
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,080
And they all loved it.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,600
The Dow Jones 39218765.

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:25,420
The Labor Department says the economy's created 156,000 percent over the 12 months ending in August, according to the latest jobs report from the government.

38
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,940
However, this is PR news in Washington.

39
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,060
Oh, thank you, Lemur.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:51,340
That dialogue at the very beginning is from the 1977 Australian end of the world movie called the last wave directed by Peter Weir, as in we are dough with Richard Chamberlain and some Australian Aborigine actors.

41
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,980
One of my favorite end of the world movies.

42
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,240
Next, our buddies exposed forehead.

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,580
have a new song out.

44
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,140
And here it is called

45
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,020
Watch Out by Exposed Foreheads.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,580
They're all around searching the surface

47
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,960
Freaking us out, making us nervous

48
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,040
We can't let our location be known

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,660
Let's escape on our own

50
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,700
Watch out, the second trap

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,240
Watch out, no time for that

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,860
Watch out, push to the limit

53
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,420
Watch out, step it in it

54
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,480
Watch out, step it in it

55
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Watch out, we stand together

56
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,100
All with all

57
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,780
We are here, one and all

58
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,760
Watch out, the second trap

59
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,300
Watch out, no time for that

60
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Watch out, push to the limit

61
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,560
Watch out, step it in it

62
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,520
Watch out, there's so many problems

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,100
Too many to mention

64
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,320
They're only problems if they're paying attention

65
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't count us out before our numbers up

66
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,360
We haven't fallen but we're gonna get up

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,320
Watch out, the second trap

68
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
Watch out, there's no time for that

69
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Watch out, push to the limit

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,860
Step in, ladies.

71
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:57,060
Let's go, ladies.

72
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,620
Dim dawn, the wicked witch is dead.

73
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Milagro!

74
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
Weight had been lifted.

75
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,520
Dear friend, do you think just maybe,

76
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,140
maybe this whole political ordeal has been affecting some of us more than we realized?

77
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,340
Psychosomatic?

78
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,620
Or just plain psycho?

79
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm definitely still plenty paranoid.

80
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,900
My fevered mind came up with all kinds of sick scenarios.

81
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,220
The scariest one involved...

82
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,080
involving nuclear codes and deals with Russia.

83
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,820
Trump fired the guy in charge of the nuclear codes a couple of days ago,

84
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,540
possibly after realizing he'd lost.

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Maybe he had a deal with Putin

86
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,400
to disable America's nukes near the end of his second term

87
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,020
and let the Russians nuke Democrat cities with impunity

88
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,200
and take over what's left of the country

89
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,840
in return for Trump's...

90
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,400
Trump's debts being forgiven

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,280
and he'd get a new 13-year-old girl every day in his secure St. Petersburg mansion.

92
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,680
But then it sunk in that he's gonna have to move the schedule up by four years.

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Paranoid?

94
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,320
I sure hope so.

95
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
But I've...

96
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,780
You know, I've got to admit, I've been greatly cheered by lurking on right-wing websites and Facebook pages,

97
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,200
which I do anyway.

98
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,680
Uh, tasting.

99
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,560
The bitter tears of the poor shattered snowflakes

100
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,280
as they deny reality just as hard as their little tiny brains can.

101
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,680
Uh, that's been almost worth the wait.

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,280
Talk about pulling the wool over their own eyes.

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,260
Not like me, of course.

104
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,520
But what was totally worth the wait

105
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,840
was Sandy Boone's documentary feature film about the church,

106
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,580
which is on Amazon now, and, uh,

107
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,580
Voodoo...

108
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,220
Or is it Hulu?

109
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Or Hoodoo?

110
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,940
Or whatever.

111
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,060
And YouTube and Roku, and I don't know what all.

112
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,160
Um...

113
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,480
It's...

114
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,140
It says what all at dobbstown.net.

115
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,140
I heard Netflix will be showing it soon.

116
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,920
The full title is J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

117
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,640
Although I think if you just type in subgenius, you'll get it and other odd related things.

118
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,500
...

119
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,220
Well, I hadn't even planned this episode, uh, number 1804.

120
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,600
But at least I was inspired to get back to Tarzan's radio station and do something live,

121
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,020
or at least not from 1986.

122
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,540
As much as I like those old-timey hours of slack.

123
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
Uh, so...

124
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,700
Well, oh, by the way, this music in the background is the Empire Jazz Orchestra,

125
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,680
an album called Symphonies in Riffs.

126
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,740
And it's actually really, really good music.

127
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,100
Anyway, I guess I need to go audition some of the mountain of contributions from total strangers

128
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,900
and new friends that have built up over the last month.

129
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,660
Uh...

130
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,020
When...

131
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:56,160
Actually, my back hurt too much for me to sit and listen to hours of stuff critically.

132
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,260
But first, this!

133
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,180
Welcome to Film School Radio, the on-air online showcase for the best in independent documentary and foreign films,

134
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,680
every Friday morning from 9 to 10 a.m. Pacific and online at filmschoolradio.com.

135
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm your host, Mike Caspar.

136
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,740
What started out as a joke.

137
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,740


138
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,740


139
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,940
An inside joke among two self-proclaimed weirdos from Fort Worth, Texas,

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,980
soon becomes much more than they bargained for

141
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,060
when they decide to turn their conservative Southern ideology on its head

142
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,340
and invent a new religion all their own.

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,080
In J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

144
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,120
we go on quite a journey.

145
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,400
It is remarkable and it is fun and it is irreverent,

146
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,280
and it's sometimes, in a weird way, serious as well.

147
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,460
So, I think that's a great way to sort of get our conversation started.

148
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,380
And I'm going to introduce to our audience the director, producer, and writer,

149
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
and that would be Sandy K. Boone,

150
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,580
as well as the Right Reverend, Philo Drummond, or Steve Wilcox.

151
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,720
To both of you, welcome to Film School Radio.

152
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you.

153
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,380
Thanks, good to be here.

154
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, thank you so much.

155
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,620
Like I said, I just had so much fun with this film.

156
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,100
Let me start by asking the director, producer, and writer of J.R. Bob Dobbs

157
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,280
and the Church of the Subgenius, and that would be Sandy K. Boone,

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,500
how did you hear about this particular church?

159
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,560
How did you hear about all this?

160
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, actually, my late husband was a member of the group,

161
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,580
and he met them.

162
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,020
He had a dear friend that was in Dallas, Texas,

163
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,960
and they came all together and they were playing.

164
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,600
He took him to go listen to a band.

165
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,560
He was in a band called the Pink Boys,

166
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,940
and they were all part of this group or knew this group,

167
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
and that's how we originally met.

168
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
So my late husband really was the reason he made the movie called

169
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,040
Invasion of the Illuminate People,

170
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,200
which was also inspired by the Church of the Subgenius.

171
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,340
And I'll use a lot of the clips of my late husband's movie

172
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,040
in the Subgenius movie.

173
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,500
What year was this?

174
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,980
Was this fairly recent or was it back in the day?

175
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,980
When was that?

176
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,380
Oh, no, no, no.

177
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,100
That was...

178
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,160
The original movie was done in 1980, 80, 81.

179
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,480
Yeah, for Invasion of the Illuminate People.

180
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,040
But the group knew each other, 79, 80, that era.

181
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,900
And Funk was thriving.

182
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,620
And we were in Dallas, and then we had moved to Austin

183
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,500
to go to film school here at UT.

184
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,960
Well, let's bring into our conversation Dr. Drummond,

185
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,100
Steve Wilcox.

186
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
Dr. Drummond.

187
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,920
Tell us a little bit about your getting together

188
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,980
with Reverend Ivan Stang, also known as Douglas Smith.

189
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,100
Tell us a little bit about the origin story of all of this.

190
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,060
Okay.

191
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,260
Well, we'd gotten together on just some kind of a group of people

192
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,340
that were artistic and creative, and we had these Sunday brunches.

193
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,400
And it was about the time of when Jim Jones had the thing going on

194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,080
in Guyana.

195
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,980
He talked 900 people into committing suicide drinking the Kool-Aid.

196
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,740
Where that expression came from now, right?

197
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,940
And so we decided that, you know, well, gosh,

198
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,320
if he could talk 900 people into killing themselves,

199
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,200
couldn't we talk 900 people into giving us a dollar?

200
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,480
You know, I mean, it's got to be simple.

201
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,400
And so Reverend Stang and I got the idea that we needed to start

202
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,460
our own religious cult.

203
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,960
And actually, there was another, you know, another motivation going on.

204
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:55,960


205
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,540
He and I both thought that we were really funny guys,

206
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,940
and that we thought we ought to be able to write comedy.

207
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,440
And one of the things we thought might be a good vehicle to display

208
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,260
our talents would be to put this silly pamphlet together that was

209
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,800
recounting this secret organization.

210
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,780
So we spent a lot of time visiting with the Scientologist and Ken Carr

211
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,940
and all these various people.

212
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,300
And we had this spinoff kind of organizations that were, you know,

213
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,640
new agey, kind of new age, new world religions and things.

214
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,940
And we went to a lot of seminars, and he and I would sit in the front row,

215
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,860
and we would be taking copious notes about what we ought to include

216
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,620
in our religion.

217
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,600
You know, we had to make it kind of like a Frankenstein monster where we

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,800
could take from every familiar trope from every major religion and mix it

219
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
with all these weird things.

220
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,780
And we would take from every weird offshoots, these cult-like religions,

221
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,960
and come up with this pamphlet that we could leave places.

222
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
And actually the leaving was secondary to the mailing out to,

223
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,160
we mailed the, initially mailed the pamphlet to 350 publishers because we

224
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,220
were still thinking we'd get a job, you know.

225
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
Somebody would sit and go, oh, this is funny.

226
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,280
We should hire these guys.

227
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,640
You know, like that really happens.

228
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,900
So anyway, we were still young and naive and thought that was a problem.

229
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,520
We thought that was a possibility.

230
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Actually, we were shooting for Saturday Night Live.

231
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,200
We thought that's where we ought to be writing comedy, you know.

232
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,960
So we put together this pamphlet.

234
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,700
We mailed it out, and we started leaving it in places we didn't know what to do.

235
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,100
It was hard to find a distributor for something that weird.

236
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,080
And so we kind of started leaving it in the same places that all the weird

237
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,560
religious organizations did.

238
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,600
It was like a super Chick track we could leave in places.

239
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
We even had a thing where we would visit, you know,

240
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:55,900


241
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,580
local record stores and secondary type, you know, alternative stores and things like that.

242
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,600
And we would sneak in there and leave our pamphlets on their periodical shelf.

243
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,580
It was always interesting to me.

244
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,520
I wish I could have figured out what it would be like to be at the store when somebody brought it up to ring up.

245
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,800
And this was the first maybe the first time that the person who was ringing it up had even seen it.

246
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,620
But we called that drop lifting.

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,240
It was like the opposite of shoplifting, you know.

248
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,200
So we did that for a while.

249
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,540
Thank you, ancient subgeniuses of the past.

250
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,600
And now from the Dobstown Mirror, a word of caution.

251
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,200
That time when you alone felt joy.

252
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,780
It was like you were held high.

253
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,900
Like you were held hostage by angels.

254
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,180
And then released and told, go tell your people what you have seen.

255
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,060
Do tell.

256
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:14,180
And send your confessions to stang at subgenius dot com.

257
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,360
Or uncleonan at gmail dot com.

258
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,640
But remember, regarding every subgenius show, read this twice.

259
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
It's a fact.

260
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,900
Some of the cosmic truths of the Church of the Subgenius are downright disgusting.

261
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,760
Just remember that J.R. Bob Dobbs has chewed them up first before he spit them in our mouths.

262
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,880
Prior to that, it was even worse.

263
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,180
Not a bucket shop.

264
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,200
If you're stirring your coffee or tea and you hit the inside of the mug, that's a sign that you'll have good luck that day.

265
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,260
If you don't hit the inside of the mug, that's a sign you'll make clever choices that day.

266
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Invent your superstitions such that you can't lose either way.

267
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,840
They're just as real as any other superstition.

268
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,860
If you're telling yourself stories, tell yourself stories.

269
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,520
Stories that don't cause you to continue to feel miserable.

270
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,360
Here's one.

271
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,780
A little saying.

272
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,760
From the same author of Dobbs Dot Town Mirror.

273
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,180
Rat in your path?

274
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Good at math.

275
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,460
You can do it too, friends.

276
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,120
Our music in the background is Bernard Herrmann's classic score for the...

277
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,540
Mysterious Island.

278
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,500
The 1960's Ray Harryhausen classic.

279
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,800
Based on Jules Verne's.

280
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,080
Very different novel.

281
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,040
And...

282
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,020
Now this.

283
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:47,120


284
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,760
Jack could never read her tattoos without her arm outstretched to slap him.

285
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,620
Under the current healthcare plan, neither could afford glasses.

286
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:15,480
Jack first came to Jill's attention with the shine of the noonday sun off the gold crown on his left molar whilst standing on a hill.

287
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,360
Jill captured Jack's interest, showing cleavage whilst bending over to pick up her pride.

288
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,180
Jack inserted a dandelion into the chest crack, marveling at the yellow reflection.

289
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,820
Butter!

290
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,080
He said proudly with a beaming grin.

291
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,100
As the hand approached his face for a muddy slap, he said,

292
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,320
He glimpsed the tattoo.

293
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,860
Mother!

294
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,840
In a heart.

295
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,740
With an anchor.

296
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,620
Snake coiling and hissing around it.

297
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:12,580
Jack, on the ground, shakes his head and looks upon the sun-drenched silhouette of Jill, fists clenched, ready for battle.

298
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm thirsty!

299
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,080
Get me something to drink!

300
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,160
She demands.

301
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:32,740
Jack, being a lawyer and realizing the implications of a woman scorned, obediently travels down the hill to comply.

302
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:46,400
Jill hears the approaching sound from the idiot cat bells on his floppy, foppish hat and perks up in anticipation.

303
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,560
She finds out that she's being banned from the party.

304
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,900
Jack returns with a plastic one-gallon bottle of pure artisan spring water.

305
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,520
Guaranteed no preservatives, just water.

306
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,380
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,680
Just water.

308
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,000
You stupid simpleton!

309
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,260
Jill shrieks.

310
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,760
I said I wanted a drink.

311
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,040
Blurred vision is one thing, but your conversation is even worse without alcohol.

312
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,660
alcohol's precious numbing agents?"

313
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,900
It was a curiously strange sound as the plastic jug met the side of Jack's head.

314
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:39,380
Pressure popped the twist-off cap's seal, and water sprayed everywhere.

315
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:50,480
Jill breathed heavily, still pissed, and look at Jack's laying body, blood mingling

316
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,140
with water, grass turning black.

317
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:03,740
She wringed her wet tank top out over him and once again noticed the gleam from his

318
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,200
mouth, nearly blinding.

319
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,060
. . .

320
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,320
Jill pulled out her Popeil's Pocket Fisherman, only available for this short time, and if

321
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
you buy now, will include a whalebone chicken scratcher, free.

322
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,600
But that's not all.

323
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,180
Here's a prairie tooth pouch in all-occasion black-tie camouflage.

324
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:40,400
She extracted that shiny golden molar without a moan and wiped the blood off on her pre-distressed

325
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,920
and frayed short shorts.

326
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,880
Falling back on her fat, gelatinous ass in the grass, Jill again looked upon her former

327
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,380
friend.

328
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,160
Blue, mixing with red.

329
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,160


330
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,160


331
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,640
Red like a Lichtenstein painting.

332
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,800
Black outline and all.

333
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:08,500
Her ringed water dots representing the pseudo-silk screening process.

334
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:23,660
She put out her foot, wrapped in classic 1970s dingo boots with patented stitching and genuine

335
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,620
leather currently found under vintage.

336
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,140
And...

337
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,180
She was on eBay and kicked Jack down the hill.

338
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,600
He rolled, he tumbled, he bounced, and at one point she could swear the goddamn thing

339
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,040
jumped.

340
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,080
The climax wasn't all that exciting.

341
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,960
Just a quick puff of dust that settled quickly.

342
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,960
Jill.

343
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,140
Jill.

344
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,220
Jill.

345
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,740
Licked her dry lips and lit a cigarette.

346
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:11,940
Water makes me thirsty, she mumbled, and waved wearily at a circling, hovering man.

347
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,320
The extreme weirdo calling itself Sheridan did that.

348
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,900
Titled Jack and Jill from his double CD called Didn't See That Coming.

349
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,020
That Sheridan guy is very original.

350
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,860
Now we're going to temporarily take a turn even further into scariness and horror with

351
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:53,260
a song by our pal Molg and his band Cult of Zier from the excellent new album Better Living

352
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,040
Through Confirmation Bias.

353
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm Jack and Jill.

354
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,440
See you next week.

355
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,960
Have a great weekend!

356
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,480
Bye for now.

357
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,060
Turn away

358
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,200
There's nothing here for you today

359
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,760
Turn black

360
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,440
Turn away

361
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,620
My heart yearns black

362
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Turn black

363
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,560
Turn away

364
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,760
My love burns black

365
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,660
Turn away

366
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,460
I've gone fishing

367
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,960
Off the deep end

368
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,400
Today

369
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,760
That kind of love is just a loathsome trap

370
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,660
I'll pay the tax and try to snatch it back

371
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,280
Burn away

372
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,000
Blame crying

373
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,660
Just wise to wish her free

374
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,340
Turn black

375
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:23,620
Turn black

376
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,280
Turn black

377
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,420
Turn black

378
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Turn black

379
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,200


380
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,440
Turn, oh turn uh

381
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
Turn back

382
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,120


383
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,340
Hey-hat

384
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,840
I know a taste of ist

385
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,840


386
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,840


387
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,840


388
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,940
It got you

389
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:54,940


390
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:54,940


391
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,300
For you

392
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,300


393
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,500
We need a long-term turnaround

394
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,180
We need a long-term turnaround

395
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,300
We need a long-term turnaround

396
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:24,840
We need a long-term turnaround

397
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:55,300
We need a long-term turnaround

398
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,660
We need a long-term turnaround

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:55,300
We need a long-term turnaround

400
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:19,100
We need a long-term turnaround

401
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:48,500
We need a long-term turnaround

402
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:24,660
We need a long-term turnaround

403
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:55,300
We need a long-term turnaround

404
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:20,740
We need a long-term turnaround

405
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:50,860
We need a long-term turnaround

406
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:25,220
We need a long-term turnaround

407
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:55,040
We need a long-term turnaround

408
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:23,000
We need a long-term turnaround

409
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:55,300
We need a long-term turnaround

410
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:25,300
We need a long-term turnaround

411
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:52,100
We need a long-term turnaround

412
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:25,140
We need a long-term turnaround

413
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:42,080
We will be so still

414
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:52,720
We will be moving forward

415
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,400
To the time when

416
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,200
The sun should come into the stars

417
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


418
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


419
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


420
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


421
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


422
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


423
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,300
Still Di tu

424
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,300


425
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,300


426
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:01,540
This time we'll be so happy And we'll be, maybe we'll be

427
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,440
This time we'll be so happy

428
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,020
Bleeding hearts with busted brains

429
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,740
Necompeddling drug convictions

430
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,360
We can leave those busted brains behind

431
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,460
We can leave those larynthroglodytes

432
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,240
You can leave your television

433
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,220
You can leave your news subscription

434
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,980
You can have new education

435
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,400
Maybe even good race relations

436
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,640
This time we'll be, maybe we'll be

437
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,760
So happy

438
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,660
And we'll be, maybe we'll be

439
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,640
This time we'll be so happy

440
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,700
We won't take their mind control

441
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,900
We won't take their fluoridation

442
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,500
We don't need the smart patrol

443
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,360
We can choose our medication

444
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,240
This time we'll be, maybe we'll be

445
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,880
This time we'll be so happy

446
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,480
And we'll be, maybe we'll be

447
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,660
This time we'll be so happy

448
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,700
Yeah, we'll be

449
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,580
Yes, I will be

450
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,620
Yes, I will be

451
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,400
so happy

452
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,500
And we'll be

453
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,320
Maybe we'll be

454
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,420
Yes, I will be

455
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,140
so happy

456
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,220
Yeah, we'll be

457
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,180
Yes, I will be

458
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,120
Yes, I will be

459
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,020
so happy

460
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:47,000
It will be, it will be, it will be

461
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,280
that I haven't seen before.

462
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,200
Brother, can you spare some slack?

463
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,460
Make America funny again.

464
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,560
Souls cleansed while you wait.

465
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,020
You may have already won.

466
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,000
This item inspected by number 13013.

467
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,660
Dear Reverend Stang,

468
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,920
I hope this letter finds you well.

469
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,560
I recently watched and thoroughly enjoyed

470
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,980
the documentary J.R. Bob-Bob's

471
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,400
and the Church of the Subgenius,

472
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,020
and wanted to reach out

473
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,840
while we're still on this planet together

474
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,160
to thank you and Philo for starting the church.

475
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,520
I think when people see how old we are,

476
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,420
they go, oh man, I need to, I need to,

477
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,100
I've been putting this off.

478
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,280
He could croak any minute.

479
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,640
I don't recall exactly the year I joined the subgenius,

480
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,720
but it was during that wonderful lost time

481
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,660
before the internet changed everything.

482
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,260
I miss those days of finding jack chick tracks

483
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
in bathrooms or reading,

484
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,460
in fact sheet five,

485
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
and of course high weirdness by mail,

486
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,840
to find the latest saucer cult

487
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,740
or alternate religion to seek mail from.

488
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,220
The fringe was so serious,

489
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,320
but in a funny way.

490
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,000
Now in the Trump side down,

491
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,480
it's serious in a terrifyingly fascist way

492
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,720
without a sense of humor.

493
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,460
What the hell happened?

494
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,220
I prefer conspiracies with a dash of humor.

495
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,700
And this is a familiar lament.

496
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,720
2020 has been a hell of a year.

497
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Multiple deaths in the family, one COVID related.

498
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,260
My spouse with MS and bypass surgery for myself

499
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,120
a few weeks back have made it hard to keep the funny.

500
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,340
Yet I have found funny,

501
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,400
having joined a subgenius group on Facebook of all things.

502
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,000
The genuine humor and oddity of my subgenius brothers

503
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,280
and sisters have helped weather the storm

504
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,580
with the panacea of laughter.

505
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,380
And in spite of any hardships,

506
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,740
I do find myself blessed with an abundance of slack.

507
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,300
I do as I please and am living comfortably,

508
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,080
though my community is about as pink as they get.

509
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,000
For those of us who identify with the trickster spirit,

510
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,320
who realize the tarot's fool is also its ascended master,

511
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,060
it's our offbeat humor that gives us our power.

512
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,640
For we who never fit in and honestly didn't want to,

513
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,740
who saw the popular kids as a nightmarish existence,

514
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,140
the church of the subgenius gave us common ground.

515
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,680
I love this congregation of the misfit,

516
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,060
the strange and the odd.

517
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,120
I do too, even after 35 years of it.

518
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,740
We fight the corrupting conspiracy of normalcy,

519
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,180
fully aware the inmates have been running the asylum.

520
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,620
We get the joke and by God, the joke is on them.

521
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,040
For all the evangelicals who quote, see the signs, unquote,

522
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,320
how many of them have noticed they've been

523
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,260
voting for a political party with a satanic elephant

524
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,840
for their national symbol.

525
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,140
Do we really need to put the sixes in those stars

526
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,660
for them to wake up?

527
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:03,520
It's the Republican logo with the stars across the elephant.

528
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,200
I don't think it would matter if they're not us,

529
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,080
the few, the odd, the subgenius.

530
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,480
Thank you again for starting the greatest joke of all time,

531
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,020
Praise Bob, from Reverend Tyrannosaurus Blasphemous.

532
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,700
Wow, and like I say, he sent five bucks.

533
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,820
Well, thank you, Reverend Blasphemous.

534
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,740
I should mention, though, that there are indeed

535
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,320
Republican subgeniuses, plenty of them.

536
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,100
I don't think there's many QAnon subgeniuses.

537
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,400
Hey, I've got a hint for y'all.

538
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,320
I'm Q. I'm the one who's been doing those.

539
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

540
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,580
Ha, ha, ha.

541
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,820
Ha, ha, ha.

542
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,440
Ha, ha, ha.

543
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:45,940
Ha, ha, ha.

544
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,000
Ha, ha, ha.

545
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,220
Ha, ha, ha.

546
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,240


547
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,240


548
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


549
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


550
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


551
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


552
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


553
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,380


554
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,920
Take that back, because somebody will believe me.

555
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,660
They've believed weirder crap, let me tell you.

556
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,820
There's been times when I couldn't believe

557
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,820
what people believed that I had said.

558
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,520
I mean, stuff I said, and they believed it.

559
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,680
Stuff that came from Church of the Subgenius.

560
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,220
They take it as gospel, as well they should,

561
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,820
but they forget the other way they should take it.

562
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,380
And if they can't,

563
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,240
they can't take it.

564
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,580
Well, I don't want to say it on the radio, but fuck them.

565
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:29,740
Anyway, friends, yes, this has been a long stretch,

566
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,340
and of course it's not over.

567
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,500
It's kind of like we're entering Act 3

568
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,880
of the National Twilight Zone nightmare.

569
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,180
And let's hope it's funnier

570
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,360
than the rest of the show.

571
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:46,360


572
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:46,360


573
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,020
It's kind of like the previous act.

574
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,420
You know what I'm saying?

575
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,780
And it doesn't end in car crashes and explosions

576
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,460
and, you know, bad monsters.

577
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,440
Cool monsters, that's different.

578
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,560
Oh, and friends, have I mentioned Ask Dr. Hal?

579
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,260
It's now on Zoom every month.

580
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,720
I think it's the second Sunday.

581
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,260
You'll have to look at, what is it,

582
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,620
gonzotronics.net slash A-D-H-S, Dr. Hal.

583
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,640
There'll be a link.

584
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,440
By the time you look at subgenius.com,

585
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,020
there'll be a link to it,

586
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,200
and possibly in the events section.

587
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,300
We haven't been doing many other events.

588
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,080
We did X-Day all on Zoom.

589
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,940
And by the way, incidentally,

590
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:42,260
I recorded days of X-Day ranting,

591
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,580
sometimes with, you know,

592
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,240
this kind of,

593
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,880
informal hour of Slack type things,

594
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,380
but also hours and hours of just people

595
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,240
standing in the road talking

596
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,280
using the Zoom thing.

597
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,360
And it was really fun.

598
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,280
It was great seeing the new people

599
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,680
and lots of our old friends.

600
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,300
But the audio from that is just,

601
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,240
I'm not going to inflict it on y'all.

602
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:08,020
I tried for a couple of shows,

603
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,380
but it sounds just,

604
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,320
I know the radio stations

605
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,140
really don't want that kind of audio.

606
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,220


607
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,620
I mean, I don't know if they're going to

608
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:16,620


609
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,440
coming over their airwaves.

610
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,360
It makes them look bad.

611
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,140
You know, it makes people fiddle with their dial

612
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,060
to see what's wrong with it.

613
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,360
And also, it's really hard to edit

614
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,800
because there's constant references to visual things,

615
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,700
which are just frustrating to the subgenius

616
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,380
listening on his car radio or her car radio,

617
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,080
or its, whatever.

618
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
I'm not even going to go there.

619
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,060
I wouldn't know how.

620
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,060
Anyway, praise Bob.

621
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,220
Everything's moving.

622
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Much, much better here on this end,

623
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,220
as long as I don't try to heave any more

624
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,760
riding mowers out of ditches by myself

625
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,760
or chase armadillos around the yard while filming them,

626
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,420
trying to get real good low angles.

627
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,280
God, I couldn't get out of bed for a week after that.

628
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,640
It was a pretty funny video, though.

629
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,780
My YouTube channel, friends,

630
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,520
it's got a lot of wildlife pictures on it now.

631
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,740
But I've got so many projects to do, friends.

632
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,240
Eyelash, the second book that we published after Neighbor World,

633
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,780
should be out in about a month or so.

634
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,760
It still needs a little more proofreading

635
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,360
and one more proof copy,

636
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,760
and I haven't been good about that.

637
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:43,420
And I have all these books I want to put together.

638
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,500
I'm not going to do them all.

639
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,560
I'm going to do all the other subgenius books,

640
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,580
old stuff that nobody's ever seen,

641
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,500
and reprints of old stuff that people have seen,

642
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,520
and new stuff.

643
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,180
But I'm 67.

644
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,760
I'm beginning to think maybe what I should do

645
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,720
rather than try to finish all these projects myself

646
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,600
in the next 10 years or so

647
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,440
is to get them ready for somebody else to finish.

648
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,820
It's going to take me 10 years just to get all these things.

649
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,400
Seriously, there must be at least

650
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,080
a dozen subgenius books

651
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,560
that are basically already done

652
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,280
on the creative end.

653
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,620
A lot of technical stuff has to be done.

654
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,340
And videos.

655
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,360
I want to do an addendum to Sandy's documentary about us.

656
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,400
I have 60 more hours of footage that nobody's seen,

657
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,080
and nobody's going to see most of it.

658
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,820
But I went out and interviewed people myself,

659
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,340
like Lonesome Cowboy Dave and G. Gordon Gordon,

660
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,740
who never ended up in the movie.

661
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,840
And there were about 25 people who got interviewed for that movie

662
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,060
and weren't in it at all.

663
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,620
I don't have that footage.

664
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,440
But I could probably get it.

665
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,860
I don't know.

666
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,660
Anyway, I'm just rattling and rattling

667
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,200
because I'm excited to be out of bed

668
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,180
and alive

669
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:11,320
and at least act one and two.

670
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,560
Act two are over.

671
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,640
We'll see how act three goes.

672
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,700
Meanwhile, thanks to the Empire Jazz Orchestra,

673
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,160
some of whom are subgeniuses

674
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,740
that we now see every week on the weekly Zoom chat.

675
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,100
That's another thing, friends.

676
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,420
You'll look at subgenius.com for the links to that.

677
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,660
I haven't been advertising it much,

678
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,780
but every Saturday,

679
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,300
subgeniuses get together and just hang out on Zoom.

680
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,780
They don't talk about Bob much,

681
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,120
or if at all.

682
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,120
You never know what they're going to be talking about.

683
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,680
Anyway...

684
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,540
Praise Bob.

685
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,400
The Empire Jazz Orchestra.

686
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,520
And now this.

687
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,220
In any event, we have more questions.

688
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,300
So, Dr. Howell, if you are ready.

689
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,560
I'm ready.

690
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,520
I'll try to answer them in a faster way

691
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,820
if there are a lot of them.

692
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,980
Actually, let me really quickly play

693
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,220
Reverend Stang's question for you.

694
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,040
I'm going to queue it up.

695
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,280
Let's have that one.

696
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,200
Yes, it's an honor.

697
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,760
Dr. Howell.

698
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,740
There he is.

699
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,380
I came up with the greatest question ever for you

700
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,140
the other night,

701
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,260
but I didn't write it down.

702
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,340
And now I've forgotten it.

703
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:38,620
No.

704
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,620
What was it?

705
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,340
Oh, wait.

706
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,800
I think I remember you getting this question before.

707
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,580
Yeah, I get a lot of them.

708
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,660
Forget that one.

709
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,620
Over again.

710
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,560
Dr. Howell, why, starting yesterday,

711
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,680
did the chronic pain in my back and neck

712
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,120
suddenly go away?

713
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Why this inexplicable desire to roll over on my back

714
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,480
and have sleepy Joe Biden rub my belly?

715
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,540
Why this strange compulsion to masturbate

716
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,200
to Jill Biden and Kamala Harris?

717
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,820
Are these somehow connected?

718
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,600
Thank you for your answer.

719
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,780
And I'll pay you Tuesday.

720
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,020
That must be the second Tuesday of the month.

721
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,980
I mean, of the week.

722
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,160
Well, dear Reverend Stang,

723
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,080
the question seems hauntingly familiar.

724
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,120
I have a feeling I even answered it earlier

725
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,960
on this program.

726
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,860
But I'll certainly answer it again.

727
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,200
It seems to have two parts.

728
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,120
Why did the pain suddenly depart?

729
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,420
And the other one,

730
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,300
why your desire to roll on your back like a puppy

731
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,540
and allow your ventral side to be massaged

732
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,760
or manipulated by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

733
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,800
Or perhaps why you desire to manipulate yourself

734
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,700
while thinking of the winners,

735
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,100
of the winners.

736
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,200
So, with that,

737
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,200


738
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,200


739
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,200


740
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,200


741
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,200


742
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,480
of the presidential election.

743
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,440
All these matters are intimately connected,

744
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,540
connected in your person

745
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,760
through the interaction of your own nervous system

746
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,100
and the careful choice made by your brain.

747
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,040
Once again,

748
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,040
not the conscious brain,

749
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:31,020
which may wish for things, but the unconscious mind, which is to say the rest of your brain,

750
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:40,580
which is able to delegate, able to create, and able to provide sensations in any order it pleases,

751
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:48,580
if it is left alone by the impulse to direct given by the conscious mind.

752
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:56,420
Your pain stopped because you, your somatic self, were tired of having the pain.

753
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,940
It is possible for the mind to take the pain away.

754
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:13,060
Yogis and other spiritual practitioners can control the pain they receive and decide when and where it happens.

755
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,560
One spiritual exercise, which has a long Indian name I can't pronounce correctly,

756
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:27,980
so I won't try, involves taking all the pain and compressing it into a rotating ball just outside your forehead.

757
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,680
And you're supposed to keep it there.

758
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,220
This works for some people.

759
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,320
But there has been a greater pain afflicting us all in the last four years.

760
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,760
A pain which the current election seems to have relieved.

761
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,540
And let us hope it has.

762
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,440
Because...

763
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,780
Because the bad actors who produced it, the irritants who produced the pain,

764
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,740
are still very much with us and on the scene.

765
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,940
Our pain is their pleasure, let us remember.

766
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:09,600
And as William Blake said, there is a class of men whose sole delight is in destroying.

767
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,920
Since they seem temporarily to be leveraged from the scene,

768
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,020
it is not surprising that puppy-like,

769
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:30,620
the most

770
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:41,800
capable of doing this, since there are many obstacles to the ultimate success which they,

771
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,200
and we, would prefer.

772
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,560
Oh, I forgot to mention that I am a doctor.

773
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


774
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


775
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


776
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


777
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


778
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,560


779
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,900
I know that.

780
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,640
Oh, I am a doctor.

781
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:51,640


782
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:51,640


783
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:51,640


784
00:57:51,640 --> 00:58:00,520
And we heard a little bit there from the November 8th 2020 Ask Dr. Howell show on zoom.

785
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:07,340
And that happens every month, second Sunday of every month, and you can find the information

You rotate it swiftly under the water, lathering away the conspiracy smudge and other schmata.

807
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:32,260
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end in the true perfect pipe placement position, you'll have good luck all day.

808
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,160
If it comes up the other way, 20 more years of winter.

It's almost every scent you can think of.
