1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
We have to warn you, what you're about to see is gross.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,980
First, Jodi sucks fat puffy eyes with accents of black and blue.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:08,700
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,180
Then the doctor whacks Jodi's mouth.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:11,860
Ready?

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,000
Jodi's fat eyes are injected into her mouth.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,060
Jodi's going to feel like whacking off.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,160
It feels weird.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,120
Making sure they're in the right positions, helping them to go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,720
And naturally, being served fat dog eyes fresh off the operating table with a shovel is gross.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,600
Calling all cars.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,260
Report to your stations for further instructions.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,500
That is all.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,440
I wonder if they found my little boy.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,880
No, we didn't, lady.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,840
Her little leapsion.

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
He's so genius.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,020
He's so smart.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
He's so smart.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,160
He's so smart.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,360
He's so smart.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,500
He's so genius.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,820
He's so smart.

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,700
He's so smart.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
As you can see on the large screen behind me,

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,660
we're keeping track of things on one of our many manned space stations now in orbit.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,220
While the small screens below show other activities being monitored by mission control.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,780
I'll have them repeated on the upper screens for you also.

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,780
SSL, this is instrumentation.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,680
Roger.

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,000
SVO, start port recorders and TV video tape recordings.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,520
Welcome.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,820
Now, new!

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,740
For limited time only in the western territories, get a free Mole Man wiener whistle with any purchase of a Moley Man brand mole meal,

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,340

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,580
Offer not valid in Retribution Zone.

37
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,480
Hello, Bob, this is Father Guido Saraducci, formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

38
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,600
and all of my fellow Popes from the People's Catholic Church.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,780
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius. Carry on.

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,260
Are we being controlled by secret forces?

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,660
Are alien space monsters bringing a startling new world?

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,740
Do people think you are strange?

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,380
Do you?

44
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,780
There is an answer.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,740
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,880
This is it.

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,580
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,260
Mob is a way of life to millions, yet half of them don't even know it.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:46,200
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,080
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

51
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,780
Shots!

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,700
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,200
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

54
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,040
Become physically attractive overnight.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,660
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:20,100
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior, to explore new ways of going over the edge.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,820
And coming right back.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,200
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

60
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,100
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,320
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,820
Welcome potential initiates.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,700
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want a girl, no judge.

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,600
Get along there now, don't you?

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,460
Give me none of your lip.

67
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,960
I never seen anybody's lady in shift in my whole life.

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,640
Don't grab me, woman.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,960
Now, I'm going to tell you again, can't go to church.

70
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,680
Let church be there next week.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
I ain't no heartache.

72
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,420
I've got you.

73
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,800
You've got you.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,560
Take your hand off me.

75
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm no right dog.

76
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm going to get the hand off you.

77
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm going to put on the shoes.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm going to walk all over God's heaven.

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,640
Heaven.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,840
Heaven.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000


82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,640
Everybody's talking about a heaven man going to heaven.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,960
Heaven.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,320
Heaven.

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm going to shop all over God's heaven.

86
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,380
Bobby is filling the blank.

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,960
The Bob that can be described as not the true Bob.

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,560
He's a trickster.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,000
Obviously, look at his face, and you could just see, you know, what's behind that smile?

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,840
What's in the pipe that he's smoking?

91
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,060
And what is it?

92
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,260
What is this game that Bob Dobbs represents?

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,060
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs

94
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,880
Bread of men and yet he walked with the gods

95
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,280
He wore a silly grin and he smoked a stupid pipe

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,580
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life

97
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,100
He whipped the stench of many a man

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,420
Fothered many children with his mighty glance

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,420
He founded the religion in which we all believe

100
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,760
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs

101
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,000
Born to humble parents somewhere in the Midwest

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,300
The child Bob experienced a traumatic

103
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,560
trauma

104
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,960
A close encounter with a UFO at the age of three

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,500
Soon thereafter he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,680
By age six he had made his first million

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Almost by accident

108
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,820
In college he met and married his first and still his primary wife

109
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,620
Connie

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,380
Who is now revered by female subgenie E

111
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,000
As the blessed anti-virgin

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,060
With Connie's encouragement

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,560
The young Dobbs was able to get a job at the university

114
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,420
And became a salesman of legendary

115
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,440
Almost frightening abilities

116
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Known to his peers as the man who could sell anything

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,260
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder

118
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,000
And might have stayed there

119
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,720
But late one night in 1953

120
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,940
While working on an amateur television of his own design

121
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,800
An event occurred which was to become a milestone

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,920
On man's mind path to slack

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,560
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit of the world

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,560


125
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,560


126
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
By the hand of Jehovah One itself

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,720
The cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament

128
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,420
The wrathful alien space god

129
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,660
From some corporate sin galaxy

130
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
In this timeless moment

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,760
Which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Dobbs received the first of countless brain curdling pronouncements

133
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,960
Which form the sacred pre-scriptures of the church

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,040
He was shown a vision

135
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,540
A world where all human beings are free from the world of the world

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,980
Where all humanity was equally wealthy

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Rich beyond imagining

138
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,500
But without working

139
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,820
This experience combined with his UFO given sales magic

140
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,760
Led him inevitably into the religion field

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,420
He quickly discovered the golden rule

142
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,360
Embodied in his classic saying

143
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
They'll pay to know what they really think

144
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,260
The true subgenius can learn to think for himself

145
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,420
But only Bob can show him how

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,140
And so Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense

147
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,720
Sense of humor and dollars and cents

148
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
A likely story you say

149
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,360
But it's simple really

150
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,840
Bob is lucky, not smart

151
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,020
In fact by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence

152
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,480
He is gifted with incredible stupidity

153
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,360
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,960
This enables him to act without thinking

155
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,880
To surf effortlessly on the luck plane

156
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,440
To float down the fabled path of least resistance

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,440
In fact to make a million dollars every time he screws up

158
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,600
Thus it is not his wisdom but his divine follies

159
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,300
His holy blunders which we emulate

160
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,080
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,720
But in what he allows you to do to yourself

162
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,960
He brings the student to the realization that

163
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,500
Everything you know is true

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,000
Under the conspiracy you're being ripped off every day

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
But you can learn to enjoy it

166
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,260
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Big man Bob

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Big man Bob

169
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,340
Big man Bob

170
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,580
Big man Bob

171
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,520
One, one dollar

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,840
Big man Bob

173
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,960
Big man Bob

174
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,720
He called his seminars instant instructions

175
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
For those who follow no master

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,180
He journeyed to Tibet

177
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,520
And under ancient holy men

178
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,180
He perfected the arts of glandscaping and acupeteing

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,320
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,060
Leaving early clues of his presence

181
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,900
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs

182
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,940
For he otherwise remains a total dumbass

183
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,140
elusive, shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.

184
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,960
In 1979, he recruited two randomly selected nobodies, Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang,

185
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,100
to begin a public outreach arm and begin spreading his seed word of slack.

186
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:41,700
Basically, the church is so omnipervasive and so full that we could not possibly get

187
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,920
into the dogma in any less than three or four hours.

188
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,260
This will outline everything, clear and concise detail, easy to read, keep it near you, and

189
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,480
we promise that any answers that you need will be found in this handy little pamphlet

190
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,980
right here.

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,320
One dollar for salvation.

192
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,020
One dollar.

193
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,740
Now you've turned your record over and you're all ready for some more Sing Time sing-along

194
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,060
songs.

195
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,520
I'll be a cowboy, a Christian cowboy.

196
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,780
I'll look for Jesus all my days.

197
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:25,660
And on the prairie or in the city, I'll help him round up all the strays.

198
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Aunt Bertha presented that song, friends, the original real life Aunt Bertha.

199
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,020
Cowboy for Jesus.

200
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
Little Timmy Tiny Talk did that.

201
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,680
Thanks to...

202
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,320
The Letter K, who brought that to us, friends.

203
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,220
Before that, we heard the soundtrack of Arise, the subgenius video, which is now on DVD.

204
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,340
That's Dr. Howell narrating and music by the Reverend D.K. Jones.

205
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:05,060
We also heard, I think, a clip of Father Guido Sarducci, some Weird Jackal commercials from

206
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,120
Lymph Node Institute, and titles and chop-ups there by Fernanda Nene Limer.

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,040
This is Hour of Slack number 935, a Bob and Jesus special.

208
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:26,960
We heard from that cute little cowboy for Jesus, and now let's join Dr. Sinister's

209
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,960
synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland and hear from another cute little cowboy.

210
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,560
You're on the air.

211
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:35,780
Hi.

212
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,080
Hello, Tim Cowboy Dave.

213
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,940
How you doing, Rob?

214
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you doing?

215
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,420
The prophecy holds true.

216
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,980
What prophecy is that?

217
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,420
I said not...

218
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,300
It's on tape.

219
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,860
I said the next caller will be Lone Cow Dave.

220
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,880
Well, why do they think...

221
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,740
Why do you think they call world leaders like you and Dr. Sinister and everybody like that

222
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,180
just a bunch of baboons in long pants?

223
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,060
Because the prophet is heaped with abuse in his own hometown or whatever.

224
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,960
Much like the baby Christ was when he was in nursery school.

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,640
The baby Christ was molested.

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,080
If we were Jesus...

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,780
I bet we'd do it again.

228
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,100
If we were Jesus...

229
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,620
We would.

230
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,260
When Jesus came back as an alien, they stoned him.

231
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,100
When he came back as a hippie, they tortured him.

232
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,880
Did you watch the Discovery Channel the other night?

233
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,220
And get a haircut?

234
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,520
Nope.

235
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Well, the problem with getting a haircut...

236
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,860
Did you hear that gibberish in the background?

237
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,300
It sounds like the digital is breaking up.

238
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,620
Sounds like the silly guy needs to...

239
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,000
Hello, hello.

240
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah, did you guys watch the Discovery Channel the other night who wrote the Bible?

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,400
Who did write the Bible?

242
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,600
The aliens did.

243
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,200
Everybody knows that.

244
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,100
Didn't God sign that?

245
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean, that's got...

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The original copy has...

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,040
It's God's signature on it.

248
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,680
Well, I went to the original signing.

249
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,640
That can't be faked.

250
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,100
Well, you know, as Mehmet Kurdar said,

251
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,300
God is the only one who is lucky and can kill whatever he wants.

252
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,700
Anytime.

253
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:03,220
But as I said, Bob is the only one who is luckier and can sell whatever he wants.

254
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,140
Whenever he wants to kill.

255
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,060
Yeah.

256
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,500
Well, he doesn't necessarily kill the people he sells to.

257
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,420
He just gives them a chance.

258
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,300
Oh, speaking of killing, back to that Jesus movie, The Passion of the Christ.

259
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,240
Well, what if Jesus is in a similar position?

260
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,260
Instead of taking those stations to the cross in his whoppings, what if he would have given

261
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,100
his $30?

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
And what if he would have been wearing a chocolate watch?

263
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,780
Well, as Paul Mavridis put it, the Romans didn't kill Jesus.

264
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,440
The Jews didn't kill Jesus.

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
The Hungarians did it.

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,560
The police killed Jesus.

267
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,780
Yes, it was the police.

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,500
It was the actual centurion guard guys there.

269
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,840
The ones that patrol traffic and club people to death for speeding with their donkey wagons.

270
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,960
Yes.

271
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,860
And it's been...

272
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,300
It wasn't the Jews or the Romans.

273
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,980
It was the cops.

274
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,360
It's always the cops that end up...

275
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,700
That execute.

276
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,820
Yes, but who gives the cops the order?

277
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,420
Who calls in the...

278
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,040
You know, who phones in the advice that says the envelope's going to be in the mail next...

279
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,200
The conspiracy.

280
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh.

281
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,980
It's just the...

282
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,940
Everybody you hate.

283
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,780
Everybody...

284
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:10,980
Everybody...

285
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:10,980


286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,540
Everybody who's against you.

287
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,520
They're all in on it?

288
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,640
I can hear your ears freezing against the window.

289
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,600
Stop breathing so heavily.

290
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,220
The guards will notice.

291
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,240
Yeah, they already know.

292
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,460
This is a star leg or a goo leg.

293
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,020
You know, I never...

294
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,060
What do you guys study in school?

295
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,340
I thought it was where Galapagos...

296
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,700
What do we guys study in school?

297
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,400
Yeah.

298
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,620
Not all of us are in school.

299
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,020
I've been out of school for 10 years.

300
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,520
Yeah?

301
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,540
What did you study in school?

302
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,160
Uh, history.

303
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,140
I went to John Carroll for 10 years.

304
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,080
10 years?

305
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,740
I got my master's and then my bachelor's.

306
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,260
Well, that sounds groovy.

307
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,380
My old man went there.

308
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,940
10 years of college and look where it got you.

309
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,020
I've got a...

310
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,620
I'm not Catholic.

311
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm not Catholic.

312
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
I've got a PhD in hard knocks.

313
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,300
You're a papist?

314
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Were you beaten by Jesuits?

315
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,740
Into a bloody pole.

316
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,680
A university of hard knocks was my alma mater.

317
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm a...

318
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,040
I've got a...

319
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,860
I've got a doctorate and a PhD in that.

320
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,120
And he can perform surgery, too.

321
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,420
But he still doesn't know the Jesuit question to the Jesuit answer.

322
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,000
Who made the world, boy?

323
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,220
Was it your teeth or was it your goo-goo?

324
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,840
You know?

325
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:32,160
Could God create a Jesuit student, a wise-ass enough to ask a question that God himself couldn't answer?

326
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,900
Did God create himself?

327
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,540
I mean, ask him that next time.

328
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,840
That would be kind of masturbatory.

329
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,840
I thought...

330
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
God was above sin.

331
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,100
Well, he self-ejaculated himself.

332
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,420
Yeah, well, that makes a lot of sense.

333
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,760
God went back in time, according to the...

334
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,140
The Big Bang.

335
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,140
The subgenius of the...

336
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,400
The Great Whiz-Bang, yeah.

337
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,860
God went back in time and copulated with his own grandmother.

338
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,900
We're going to start a whole new conversation here.

339
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,760
Are you ready for this one?

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,220
You are God's grandmother, the Stella Maris itself.

341
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,460
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,120
I'm my own grandpa.

343
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm my own gratitude.

344
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm my own gratitude.

345
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,860
I'm my own gratitude.

346
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,340
When God did that with his grandmother, he gave birth to the earth.

347
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,320
Dude, that could be said about every religion.

348
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,660
When you say that all religions are fairy tales.

349
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,380
Yeah, you could...

350
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,340
You could count...

351
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,000
Beanstalk was a fairy tale.

352
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,540
What?

353
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,140
No, not Jack of the Beanstalk.

354
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,420
No, but...

355
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,680
You didn't talk about the Bible.

356
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,500
You didn't talk about...

357
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,860
No, I...

358
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
You cannot stand there and blaspheme Jack.

359
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
But if you start talking about the Beanstalk being...

360
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,960
The Beanstalk.

361
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,300
Man.

362
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,300
You crossed the line.

363
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,840
This blasphemy.

364
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,600
This blasphemy.

365
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,060
This apostasy.

366
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
The Beanstalk is...

367
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,060
You dare to question the Holy Writ.

368
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,220
You know, I happen to be a...

369
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,340
I'm a Beanstalkian, and I get offended when someone...

370
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,600
Yeah, Michael Jack is...

371
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,940
Are you saying that I was stupid enough to trade my car in for a useless bean?

372
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,860
Next caller.

373
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,580
You're on the air.

374
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,780
There's no grounding.

375
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,940
There's no center point for the Beanstalk.

376
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,180
Oh, man.

377
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,300
Everything must spring upward.

378
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,500
What was that, man?

379
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,840
And there must be beans, and there must be giants, and there must be clouds.

380
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,500
You can't even believe what...

381
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,440
They need to be pushed into shape.

382
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,520
They need to be molded.

383
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
These children need to be...

384
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,560
These children need to be molded like Jesus' head.

385
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,580
Remember how they molded to Jesus' head?

386
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,260
And now they took each little frond of hair...

387
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,320
Speaking of Jesus' head...

388
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,040
So when they did the final...

389
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,180
Speaking of Jesus' head...

390
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,160
Has anybody seen that porno movie about...

391
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,940
Jesus that's going around that...

392
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,640
I mean, not to be disrespectful or anything, but...

393
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,800
Where they're slapping the Lord?

394
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,140
You know, there are some people who would want to go see a movie where they beat up Jesus

395
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,980
for different reasons than others might.

396
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,200
Some might want to identify with their Lord as he...

397
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
I just want to hear him go,

398
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,680
Ouch, ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, and stuff like that.

399
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Yeah, some people just want to see him get beat up.

400
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,260
It's the sound.

401
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,980
It's kind of like an audio thing for me.

402
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,700
I want to hear him go...

403
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm not into that.

405
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,760
What?

406
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,640
Hearing him being put back...

407
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,580
I'm not into anybody getting beaten up, okay?

408
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm not into anything.

409
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,700
I mean...

410
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm not into anything either.

411
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
Well, you look like you're trying.

412
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm like out of it, totally.

413
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,420
You are.

414
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,560
Okay?

415
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,700
But you look like you're trying extremely hard.

416
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,380
That is so nihilistic, man.

417
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,180
Well, nihilism.

418
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,860
This is where we're at now.

419
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,600
This is the lowering of the table and the connecting of the floor.

420
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
We're in the same place.

421
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,860
Everybody...

422
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,600
Nihilism rules the land now.

423
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,240
Well...

424
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,840
You're not going to find a lot of optimism.

425
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
You're not going to find a lot of...

426
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaking...

427
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,840
There's a lot of creative exuberance going on.

428
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,560
No, man.

429
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
Nihilism rules.

430
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,480
No, nihilism rules.

431
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,020
I don't know.

432
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,540
I mean, within the nihilism part, there's a lot of sick, sick, sick depraved enthusiasm.

433
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
Well, it is a form of enthusiasm.

434
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
Enthusiasm for torture.

435
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,600
The elongation of the tongue, disconnection of the maxillary glands, mispronunciation

436
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,320
in vowels.

437
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,780
Making fun of Jesus, such as these...

438
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,160
Of course, the subgeniuses, when that movie came out, had to go...

439
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,520
To come up with their best one-line review of Mel Gibson's passion.

440
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,160
And among the wonderful one-line reviews we got was...

441
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,820
Jesus Christ Reanimator.

442
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,420
I Spit on Your Empty Grave.

443
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,820
Who's Afraid of Judas Iscariot.

444
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,180
The Longest Day.

445
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,600
The Great Escape.

446
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,840
Merry Christmas, Mr. Christ.

447
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,900
Rosemary's Messiah.

448
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,240
Last Tango in Bethlehem.

449
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,520
Well, this is one of my favorites.

450
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,820
The Fool on the Hill.

451
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,620
The Fool on the Hill.

452
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Apocalypse Later.

453
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,240
And what else?

454
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh, Mr. Sister had the best ones.

455
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,180
No Weddings and a Funeral.

456
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,020
This is, of course, Mel Gibson's The Passion.

457
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,460
One-line reviews.

458
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,820
The Unforgiven.

459
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,460
Mr. Iscariot's Holiday.

460
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a bad, bad, bad, bad...

461
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,320
One of my favorites here.

462
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
Lost in Translation.

463
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,440
And The Ghost.

464
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,280
I like The Fool on the Hill because it reminds me of the old school joke where...

465
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,940
Oh, My Big Fat Roman Crucifixion.

466
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,800
Lord of the Nails.

467
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,340
The Silencing of the Lamb.

468
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,120
And The Ghost.

469
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,720
And Mrs. Magdalene.

470
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,140
Oh, that sounds like it required an awful lot of thought.

471
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,480
I absolutely do.

472
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,040
Someone is contemplating...

473
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,620
Is it a feature movie?

474
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,780
...on this subject in general.

475
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't know if it's too much.

476
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
Go on and sing her.

477
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,660
About Jamuna and Jajuna.

478
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,320
About a swinger.

479
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,780
Go on and sing her.

480
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,940
About a sky of blue or a T-42.

481
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,800
Anything with a swing of two.

482
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
And I love you.

483
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,380
I love her too.

484
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,760
I love her too.

485
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,320
Sing.

486
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,840
Well, I was just going to ask Rob as a personal, you know, just right inside of this what you're talking about.

487
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,240
Mm-hmm.

488
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,980
If anybody was in Mentor over the last few days when they saw the Flying Feather thing...

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,980
The M-Town?

490
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,480
...with lights on it.

491
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,440
The M-Town?

492
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,140
You weren't supposed to see that.

493
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,020
I mean, what about the...

494
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,660
What feather?

495
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,060
Flying...

496
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,800
Flying across the lake and then it just...

497
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,460
It was like men around 6'15".

498
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,600
6'8", 7'3", 5'5".

499
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,420
If any of your callers were from Concord, if they saw this weird...

500
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
Whatever the hell it...

501
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,920
Stop traffic.

502
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,860
Hello?

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,780
Stop traffic?

504
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,900
Yeah, I mean, people were bumping into each other.

505
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,420
What was it now?

506
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,420
Did they call it a feather because of its feather-like movement?

507
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,740
Yeah, and it looked like one wing.

508
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,180
But it had lights on it and it was, you know, made of stuff.

509
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,560
Non-feathery stuff.

510
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,180
And it would swoop like a feather back and forth, sort of?

511
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,340
It kind of, yeah.

512
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,320
It kind of flibbled in the wind like a feather would do.

513
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,660
That's a very common...

514
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,120
That's a commonly seen...

515
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,560
Well, let's call it a UFO for this broadcast conversation.

516
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,800
So you're saying the capital of Mars is now Mentor, Ohio?

517
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,520
No, those are just...

518
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,580
Dave, if you had read your book...

519
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,240
Look at the subgenius, you would know that those are what we might call juvenile delinquents.

520
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,140
Oh, yeah.

521
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,820
The kids.

522
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,540
The late greys who might as well just be, you know, errant earth men as for all the difference.

523
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,420
Yeah, well, so...

524
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,940
They aren't from us.

525
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,260
They're really not that different from us primates.

526
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,320
Yeah.

527
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,020
I'm thinking of playing some Mentors later.

528
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,800
Calling them aliens at this point.

529
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,740
They've been around for so long and they're so obnoxious that it's...

530
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,540
You might as well just call them our fellow monkeys.

531
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Because they're as helpless as we are.

532
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,100
Before the forces of nature.

533
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,500
Negi, yes, I dare say it.

534
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:40,920
And Bob.

535
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,920
And Jehovah One.

536
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,840
And the Exus.

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,220
And Gbrok Fran.

538
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
And the Yakutisma.

539
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,640
The Martians and the greys.

540
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,060
The Venusians.

541
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,680
The Aryan Brotherhood.

542
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,400
The Nazis.

543
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,500
The human conspiracy.

544
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,660
All of that pales in insignificance compared to Godzilla.

545
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,520
Jehovah.

546
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,820
Wotan.

547
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,400
Tetralingus.

548
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
And the others.

549
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,600
God.

550
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,020
Jesus.

551
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,300
Corpus Christi.

552
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,980
Well, not Jesus, maybe.

553
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,580
Rob, what do you think of this?

554
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,180
Do you...

555
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,660
What do you think of this?

556
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,340
What do you think of what he just said?

557
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,620
I mean...

558
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,440
The beanstalk itself pales in insignificance compared to the power of Nunu.

559
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,680
There's a key to its beanstalking.

560
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,640
Beanstalk.

561
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,600
Beanstalk.

562
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,480
That's it, man.

563
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,040
Where all the believers can gather.

564
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,640
These beans, man.

565
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,660
It's like...

566
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,560
The whole culture is based on...

567
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,540
Beans, you know?

568
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,320
It's like...

569
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,580
Magic beans.

570
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,740
If you look at a chair, that's really like a bean, dude.

571
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,840
And Lenny Reifenstahl and Eisenstein having a good old whack under the bridge by the...

572
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,580
What's the name of that nuclear power plant?

573
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,880
Perry or Davis Bessie.

574
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,680
They're gonna carry us up to this giant house in heaven, man.

575
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,560
Yeah, that's...

576
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,840
That's cinema, dude.

577
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,020
That's what my friend said that I did to him.

578
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,760
I sold the car for these magic beans.

579
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,360
The big giant forehead was a mat.

580
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,580
Man, my uncle painted it.

581
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,260
We're gonna be famous, dude.

582
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,700
People are gonna go for it.

583
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,280
This is gonna be the next big thing.

584
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,500
Beanstalks that are like five, ten miles high.

585
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,040
Well, why can't people look forward to good old-fashioned insignificance?

586
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,040
That's what I've always created in myself.

587
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,500
Why can't people say, like, tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna be a worse person than I was...

588
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,700
Right, leave a small footprint.

589
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,380
Huh?

590
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,400
As the old saying says, white men build big...

591
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,780
Big fire, sit far back.

592
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,460
Indian build small fire, sit up close.

593
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,800
No, you're gonna wanna live between the cracks, man.

594
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,520
You gotta...

595
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,040
You gotta leave a small footprint behind so they can't track you.

596
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,860
You have to have very low radar.

597
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,640
That's exactly what I say.

598
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,240
Under the fence.

599
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,900
That's what I say.

600
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,260
Put the door.

601
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,140
Crack in the butt.

602
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,820
All the way down the line, man.

603
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,380
You just gotta be secretive.

604
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,700
And we're all pieced together like broken glass, you know?

605
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,740
It's amazing what...

606
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,720
Whatever that guy...

607
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,220
You know...

608
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,800
What's his name?

609
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,820
The creator of...

610
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,860
Dobs.

611
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,320
No, no, the real creator.

612
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,480
Oh, uh, Tetragrammaton.

613
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,600
Tetralingus.

614
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,800
Five, the five...

615
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,640
The five-tongued vessel.

616
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,180
The one that sails early, you know what I'm saying?

617
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,820
I'm talking obliquely because, you know...

618
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,920
I get mixed up because there's so many of them.

619
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,360
There's the old personality hood of the goodness hood of Krishna, for instance.

620
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,060
Well, he loves goats and he has his gopis to confuse himself with.

621
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,140
Right.

622
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,660
His gopis and his, uh...

623
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,300
His, uh, conies.

624
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,500
His friendly cows.

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,480
Notwithstanding, his beauty outshines even Bob's.

626
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,300
His saffron beauties, his wonderful breath, his sweet flower-fragrant tears.

627
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,300
His beloved of all the gopis.

628
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,900
I've got some art...

629
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,780
I've got some art books about Krishna that would...

630
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,800
You know, they never really show anything, but they kind of...

631
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,900
You get kind of turned on after a while.

632
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,080
Have you seen, like, a three-shot of olive oil pie?

633
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,120


634
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,820
Popeye and Krishna?

635
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,380
Like, Krishna's got his, like, 50 arms around each one of them.

636
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,000
They're all smiling.

637
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,340
They look like they're at some kind of baptism party or something.

638
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,860
Okay, man, that's a good question for the audience.

639
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,760
How many people have been turned on by religious artwork?

640
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,040
How many people out there have seen a piece of artwork depicting a deity or a prophet, perhaps?

641
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,440
How many people have even...

642
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,780
How many people have even gone so far as to actually gratify themselves while beholding such an image?

643
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah.

644
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,940
Because I know girls who are turned on by...

645
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,360
Turned on by Jesus-type figures, you know?

646
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,980
And, you know, if some...

647
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,000
I know some guys who are so depraved that, you know, any statue of a naked body,

648
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,860
even if it's the, you know, statue of Venus or something, like, you know, they'll...

649
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Man, they don't care.

650
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,640
That's me.

651
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:58,160
Well, let's ask the listeners out there if St. Anne, the men, if St. Anne gives them a banana.

652
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh.

653
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,860
Or if...

654
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,540
Is that a St. Anne?

655
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,100
Is that a statue of the Virgin Mary in your pocket?

656
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,800
Yeah.

657
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,700
She's a Virgin Mary.

658
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,360
She's something...

659
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,400
It was never all that sexually attractive.

660
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,380
I was blind just a short while ago.

661
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
You know, to...

662
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,740
I don't think except to Catholics.

663
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,720
Chaplains?

664
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,420
Yeah.

665
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,800
Catholic church.

666
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,060
Papists.

667
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,800
Well, we'll have no potpourri here unless it's the kind that smells like me.

668
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
I don't even know.

669
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,860
Roman dictator.

670
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:34,180
I grew up originally in Baptist Fort Worth, and to us, Jews were some ancient race from a thousand years ago,

671
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,980
and Catholics...

672
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,960
I mean, Catholics were these weird cultists.

673
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
There were just a few of them in town.

674
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,220
Yeah, we have senior people, and many of them have large ears and very small foreheads.

675
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,760
Yes, but their kind are spreading, have you not noticed?

676
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,240
I have.

677
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,720
George Bush has declared his solidity in a fashion because he's kind of a vapid person,

678
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,360
but he's declared solidarity with the right in a way that actually would make most normal dogs vomit.

679
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,400
The walkery-eyed waterheads.

680
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,600
They themselves seem to be a successful genotype in this day and age.

681
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

682
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,380
Well, look who's here, so you come at last.

683
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,120
One look at my book will reveal your past.

684
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

685
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,180
Hmm, let's see now.

686
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,100
Shooting craps, stealing chickens, missing church, rain the dickens.

687
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

688
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,340
That's bad.

689
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:42,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

690
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

691
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

692
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

693
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

694
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

695
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

696
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

697
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

698
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

699
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:05,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

700
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,840
What if they're right?

701
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,940
And Jesus has held the door open for us to get true slack, and we're mockers.

702
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,060
We've laughed it off.

703
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,680
There is a hell, and we're destined for it.

704
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,220
What if?

705
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
Well, it's all the same, I would say.

706
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,100
No, not at all.

707
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,540
Well, I lay so far.

708
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:45,960
You're turning down eternal life and slackdomness for, what, just joy here during this brief span of your life?

709
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,000
The spasm.

710
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,360
The sad little 80, perhaps if you're lucky, 80 years of toil.

711
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,240
What's it all worth?

712
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,960
Sand in the hourglass dropping.

713
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you just going to laugh it off while the Son of God looks down at you and weeps for your soul,

714
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,620
thinking, if only.

715
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,220
If only.

716
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,220
He could truly understand what Bob is telling you.

717
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,620
If he had half a brain, he'd know what we're going through.

718
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,620
If only.

719
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,820
If only.

720
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,420
If Jesus only had a heart, he'd come down here and he'd solve this mess.

721
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,200
No, no, that was the idea.

722
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,940
If he only had a brain, he'd think us out of it.

723
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,760
No, but see, Dave.

724
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,000
If he had big, big feet without those holes in them, he'd walk us around town and show us the better sights,

725
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,460
and we'd have a hell of a good time.

726
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,540
Dave, Jesus did those things, and you weren't paying attention.

727
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,700
I wasn't even born, Stan.

728
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,680
You were too busy.

729
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,680
I was not even born.

730
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:34,820
Just sticking to the Bible.

731
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


732
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


733
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


734
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,140
Corpus Moneyhock takes and denies them.

735
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,100
Screaming and making funny jokes.

736
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,960
He was playing in a band called the Clocks.

737
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,940
Come through in memory of me.

738
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,920
In remembrance.

739
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,400
He offered you these things, and Bob held out his hand, likewise.

740
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,960
He offered me some weird, what do I call them, blues and punch.

741
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,200
Now it's your time to die.

742
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,980
When the music ends, someone dies.

743
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,760
Oh, you got to give the devil his due.

744
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,320
Yeah.

745
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,420
You got to give the devil his due.

746
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, for a nurse, you always had your way.

747
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,220
Yeah.

748
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,320
Rank your gym and slept your life away.

749
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,800
Oh, yeah.

750
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Now, since for that, you're going to have to pay, because you got to give the devil his due.

751
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,580
Yeah.

752
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
You got to give the devil his due.

753
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,680
Yeah.

754
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah.

755
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,100
Yeah.

756
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,220
Yeah.

757
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


758
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


759
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


760
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


761
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


762
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


763
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


764
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


765
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


766
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220


767
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,860
You got to, you got to, you got to, you got to, you got to give the devil his due.

768
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,040
All right, boys.

769
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Give him the works.

770
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,300
Yeah.

771
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:43,860
Yeah.

772
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,900
Yeah.

773
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,140
Yeah.

774
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Yeah.

775
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,300
Yeah.

776
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:50,780
Yeah.

777
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,840
Yeah.

778
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,120
Yeah.

779
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,160
Yeah.

780
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:52,840


781
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,880
Oh, yeah.

782
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,260
Yeah, that's right.

783
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,540
Now, here's a better song other than the one we just listened to.

784
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:20,820
Whattype.

785
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:21,600
Whattype.

786
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,500
Do more Ratinar.

787
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,500


788
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,760
Thank you, everyone.

789
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:22,820


790
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,860
Heaven, heaven, heaven

791
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,620
Everybody talking about heaven ain't going there

792
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,120
Heaven, heaven, heaven

793
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,160
Gonna shout all over God's heaven

794
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,700
Heaven, fiction and truth run a very close parallel.

795
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,020
I'll be back in just a moment.

796
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,360
Welcome back.

797
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,800
We're with our not-so-secret society here, our audience.

798
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,080
And we're going to take a question.

799
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,040
What is your name?

800
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,800
My name is Deborah.

801
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,700
Okay, not too close to the mic there.

802
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,640
Is that your hat you're wearing there?

803
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,680
Oh, no, it isn't.

804
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,340
You're in a secret society?

805
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,500
No, I don't.

806
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,420
Did you do that?

807
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,780
No, but I will make a secret society in this world, if you let me try.

808
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,320
Okay.

809
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,740
But what I want to know is about the churches.

810
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,920
You say it's a secret society about churches?

811
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,060
Oh, the church of the subgenius is secretly famous.

812
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, it is.

813
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,780
Well, I like that.

814
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,720
I'm going to ask you to try this church I have out.

815
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,200
It's a very good secret, okay?

816
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,060
What's the name of your church?

817
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,680
It's called the Garden of Eden, okay?

818
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,980
Well, it sounds...

819
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,960
I've heard of that.

820
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,620
I've heard of that.

821
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,660
That was in that book.

822
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,400
It's already a movie.

823
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah.

824
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,240
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine.

825
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,600
And I didn't know who he was.

826
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,020
Exactly.

827
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,960
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the church of the subgenius.

828
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,960
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

829
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,460
Disciples.

830
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,480
Disciples.

831
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,260
Disciples.

832
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,160
Yeah.

833
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,920
All right.

834
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,600
You know, it's funny.

835
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,340
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

836
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,600
Poor Bob.

837
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,720
Oh, how are we to know that?

838
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,180
The fact is, friends, Jesus had many disciples named Dopey.

839
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,600
Yeah, actually, Jesus did have a disciple named Dopey.

840
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,800
Cheesy, deluxe.

841
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,120
He had seven dwarves as well as 12 disciples, didn't he, Reverend Ivory Stinks?

842
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
He had a number of other...

843
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,780
Cadarets.

844
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Well, it was a vaudeville show they were trying to do.

845
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,960
They were preaching the word...

846
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,340
Wonder One picker on the way.

847
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,860
They were preaching the word of slack across the Midwest in a traveling wagon show that would stop at hotels, bars, and stuff.

848
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,820
These vaudeville, kind of risque vaudeville acts that were designed to get the rubes in.

849
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
Then they would start preaching to them.

850
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,560
You know, once they got them, they used the soft alabaster bouncing round things to get the...

851
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,300
The beanbag.

852
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,280
The townsfolk in, the men anyway.

853
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,740
Then they'd start preaching.

854
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,740
Connie would come out and start preaching about slack.

855
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,400
Bob would go around kind of picking the pockets, literally.

856
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,660
Alabaster poontang, right.

857
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,840
And spiritually of these businessmen.

858
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
Sucking their souls right out while they were talking.

859
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,160
And these souls can be seen lifting up to heaven.

860
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,740
In vivified liquid form.

861
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,000
In non-earth.

862
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,280
Viewer number three.

863
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,880
I've never seen any.

864
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,300
They're shimmering like lights.

865
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,460
I'm...

866
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,620
Gating and undulating of skyward.

867
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,660
And it looks like they're so...

868
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,200
Singing the praises of their...

869
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Millions and millions of...

870
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,340
J.R. Bob Dogs.

871
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Drama.

872
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,140
Brave Bob.

873
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,700
One day when I was home, I heard a mighty roar.

874
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,740
There were a thousand people.

875
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,760
Right outside the door.

876
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,780
Help us, Jesus, help us!

877
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,100
Came the cheering from the mob.

878
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,960
Then they got a look at me.

879
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,100
Oh, not just only Bob.

880
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,320
Jesus, Brother Bob.

881
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,900
Jesus, Brother Bob.

882
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,660
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

883
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

884
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,520
I'd be more than the brother of God, Junior.

885
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,280
He died upon the cross.

886
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,280
I thought that I was free.

887
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,760
Finally, I was free.

888
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


889
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


890
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


891
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


892
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


893
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


894
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


895
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


896
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


897
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


898
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


899
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


900
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


901
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:20,760


902
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,540
Would God apart.

903
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:29,160
My soul would understand.

904
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,960
I hope people would have the strength to jump out of this pandemic to heal me.

905
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,820
I must go and get some help.

906
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,960
Go up to G encryption.

907
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:46,100
Or, I'll be are kind of your csak in another job.

908
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,720
Let's go

909
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:46,720


910
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:46,720


911
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:47,980
Yes sir.

912
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,480
Dear?

913
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,160


914
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
Jesus Brother Bob, a nobody relative of the Son of God.

915
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,380
If only I'd been born just a little sooner,

916
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,360
I'd be more than the brother of God, Junior.

917
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,780
Bob.

918
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,640
Oh, Wally, don't you look sweet.

919
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,060
Doesn't he, Ward?

920
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Yeah, reminds me of the time my brother and I had our prize hog on the 4-H Club show.

921
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,640
Uh-huh.

922
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,620
Well, uh, what was, uh...

923
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,640
What do you think, Beeve?

924
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,660
Yeah, sure, Dad. Sure, Dad. Yes, Dad.

925
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,480
Okay, Dad.

926
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,440
Oh.

927
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,340
Here.

928
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,380
Do you think Wally's old enough to have prize hogs?

929
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,920
Well, dear, a boy's life can't be all one-sided.

930
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,120
He can find his own girlfriends like I used to.

931
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,820
Well, when Mrs. Hanson called, she said there was a dance at the country club in two weeks.

932
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,360
What for?

933
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,020
Mrs. Hanson said it was for prize hogs.

934
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,820
I'd hardly approve of his going steady with one prize hog,

935
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,760
but I certainly don't.

936
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,320
If you don't approve of his going steady with her mother.

937
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,320
What do you think, Beeve?

938
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,260
She'll be coming when she comes.

939
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,920
She'll be coming when she comes.

940
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,120
Oh.

941
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,140
Yes, Dad.

942
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,700
Okay, Dad. Sure, Dad.

943
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,880
Well, Wally, uh, your mother tells me you may need a white prize hog for a dance soon.

944
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,920
Yeah, well, I, uh, I think I might try that.

945
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,800
Okay.

946
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,580
You know, Wally, when I was in college, there was a prize hog who, uh,

947
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,140
well, who rather took a fancy to me.

948
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,640
Gee, Dan.

949
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,320
Uh, anyway, I wouldn't let this thing get off.

950
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,060
Yeah.

951
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,060
Lee Murr did that.

952
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,600
Beeve it to Lee Murr.

953
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,160
And before that, Jesus is Brother Bob by the Arrogant Worms.

954
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,280
Uh, thanks to Norrell Pref for that.

955
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,060
And now let's go back in time to the distorted days of February 2004

956
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,120
to radio station KPFA in Brooklyn.

957
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,500
Berkeley, where puzzling evidence mixes the tapes.

958
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,600
And Dr. Howell, uh, vies with Dr. Philodrummon for mastery of the air and brain waves.

959
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,960
Because, let's face it, friends, the conspiracy is making you

960
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,900
totalized.

961
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,300
Let's say your desire happens to be

962
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,400
And act straight.

963
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,420
more money.

964
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
And wear that smile.

965
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,500
And make that sale.

966
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,000
And watch that show.

967
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,260
And eventually think that thought.

968
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,120
Let's say your desire happens to be

969
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,620
And so on.

970
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,420
And so on.

971
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,580
More money.

972
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,340
And so on.

973
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,940
Oh, yes, I, well, it, it is, but, uh, there are other things I desire even more in my

974
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,640
lopsided vision.

975
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,020
Let's say your desire happens to be more money.

976
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
Well, it isn't.

977
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,820
A bell is to ring.

978
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,920
A horn is to blow.

979
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,520
Just in case there were people in charge who really didn't care what money they left on

980
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,240
the planet after they got through.

981
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,700
And money?

982
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,840
Money is to burn.

983
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,700
But I didn't.

984
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,740
I kept reaching into the envelope.

985
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,160
Help, stop.

986
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,080
Somebody stop him.

987
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,140
He's burning that money.

988
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,580
Stop.

989
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,260
It was like seeing myself on a screen or in a dream.

990
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,920
Like, like a bombing of a prison.

991
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Not the things like that or anything.

992
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,720
Like a bombing of a prison.

993
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:53,720


994
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,020
No one ever burns money.

995
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,180
Just in case.

996
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,460
And this pamphlet that you're reading.

997
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,060
Or, do you, lady?

998
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,380
I sometimes wonder what happens to mine.

999
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,820
This pamphlet.

1000
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,240
I understand.

1001
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,340
If you're anything like me.

1002
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,140
I couldn't exactly tell you where to go for secret meetings.

1003
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,180
Your typical financial transaction goes something like this.

1004
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,900
Because those secret characters were too slacked out.

1005
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Or just too frapped out.

1006
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,260
That'll be $29.95.

1007
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,300
I don't have that dream.

1008
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,720
I don't have that dream.

1009
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,880
I don't have that conspiracy to be even that organized.

1010
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,720
I have too less damage.

1011
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,940
You won't lend me the money?

1012
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,480
But for what?

1013
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,560
It simply lets you know that you were there.

1014
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,580
Then just let me have 50.

1015
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,480
I'll pay you back.

1016
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,560
And there were weirdos like you that you couldn't even trust.

1017
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,840
But Bob illuminates all.

1018
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,440
Because if the awful crap does come down.

1019
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,360
Awful.

1020
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,140
The assholes will gang up to ferret out the abnormals.

1021
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:43,920
And elbows.

1022
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Who tend to want to just fend for themselves.

1023
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,060
We still have major witch hunts in this country every 20 years or so.

1024
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,360
He's evil.

1025
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,960
Burn him.

1026
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,040
Burn him.

1027
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,320
But what?

1028
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,880
But what if this little society...

1029
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,860
This...

1030
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,420
There was a secret.

1031
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,320
Goody Hoggins, because of the stain of your immortal soul from your exhortation with Satan

1032
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,060
and his innumerable...

1033
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,160
...because it didn't want to become a society.

1034
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,160


1035
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,580
Even if most of the time it only existed as a secret to maintain it.

1036
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1037
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1038
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1039
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1040
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1041
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1042
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1043
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1044
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1045
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,580


1046
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,180
as an indiscutable propaganda and odd public behavior

1047
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,620
that always popped up in the strangest places.

1048
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,520
And then...

1049
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,520
Wouldn't it have to disguise itself as a joke to even exist?

1050
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,420
Their hands and their hair!

1051
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,600
You cast a spell on the lot of you!

1052
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,340
Why would you want to join anything if you don't join things?

1053
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,440
If you're not a joiner, if you can't join things,

1054
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,580
it's impossible for you to follow.

1055
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Well, if all you can do is lead and yet you don't want followers,

1056
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,460
what do you do?

1057
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,600
Well, followers don't come because you want them.

1058
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
They just sort of come and then you have to give them useful work to do.

1059
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,480
And yet sometimes you ignore your leadership skills

1060
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,480
for fear of mindless followers

1061
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,180
slowing you down, robbing you of your slack,

1062
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,980
and then you have to study the epismetries of the public.

1063
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,280
Many hours of fruitless labor because of the frozen ground

1064
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,560
many hours of fruitless labor have taken place

1065
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,880
which could have been spent on profitable endeavors

1066
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,400
and effects that would advance mankind's aspirations

1067
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,240
in his eternal journey to the stars.

1068
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,320
...person and others of that ill?

1069
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,440
Well, if you did have a thing like that, it'd have to be pretty ambiguous.

1070
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,080
That's for sure.

1071
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,240
The left hand knoweth not what the right hand doth.

1072
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,360
I never quite let you get a grip on whether they were a sick joke

1073
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,500
or if they were serious or what.

1074
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,880
You have the answer.

1075
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,560
The very...

1076
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


1077
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


1078
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


1079
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


1080
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,740
The very fact that they raised the question first

1081
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,220
could itself be interpreted as part of the act.

1082
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,440
Or...

1083
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,920
If you wonder about all the...

1084
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,120
You wouldn't be able to tell.

1085
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,900
I can tell some...

1086
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,360
But...

1087
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,680
I am just a conspiracy.

1088
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,300
...in a movie theater in my old age.

1089
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,360
I can't really...

1090
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,000
It's not as black and white as it used to be.

1091
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,460
There's a large...

1092
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,680
You get to thinking, can this thing be for real, maybe?

1093
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,100
Is this for real?

1094
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,600
Is this really something that's for real?

1095
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,220
Hey, hey, is this your little...

1096
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,340
All of which is demoralizing our youth.

1097
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,920
Hey, hey, hey, are you Trekkies?

1098
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,740
Is there really something that's going on that I just don't know about?

1099
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,480
What's that guy with the pipe there?

1100
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,760
Is he for real?

1101
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,160
Is this supposed to be your little church?

1102
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Or maybe I've heard about this Bob crap somewhere

1103
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,400
and it sounded like just a takeoff on cults

1104
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,240
and totalitarian societies and sales gurus

1105
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,460
and mysterious powers of luck.

1106
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,420
That had something to do with the slack stuff?

1107
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,260
Thou fools, thou art indeed whited than several bears.

1108
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,100
Gosh, how could we be getting enough slack?

1109
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,640
Having all appearance of rectitudes outwardly,

1110
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,600
but inside being cleaning vessels of corruption.

1111
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Because of the conspiracy I didn't know about?

1112
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,020
That's just so.

1113
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,220
You will not examine Bob and his doctrines.

1114
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,880
You didn't even know?

1115
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,960
Then you must suffer after X-Day

1116
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,180
while the subgeniuses are seized up in the rupture,

1117
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,860
drawn up into the air with a shout and a blow of the trumpet

1118
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,740
to achieve sexual congress.

1119
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,540
The conspiracy that's a self-perpetuating role...

1120
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1121
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1122
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1123
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1124
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1125
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,580
...in the pleasures spewed by the sex goddesses.

1126
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,000
...while the peaks of the nebula...

1127
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,960
Is that the one you're talking about?

1128
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,500
...on the thieving, buckling surface of the Earth...

1129
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,160
...holds Fry in hell...

1130
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,120
The conspiracy that, much like the song that refuses to die...

1131
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,360
...the song of Bob...

1132
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
...just keeps going and going and going...

1133
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,900
...of our mass communications mediums...

1134
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
...there's a dark and shadow side of Bob and his brother...

1135
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,360
...and the subgeniuses know well...

1136
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,760
...he keeps pounding along like a relentless juggernaut...

1137
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,820
...this is a dark and heavy work of a treason...

1138
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,300
...flattening everything in its path...

1139
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,300
...and you and all your slackful days...

1140
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,260
...because you know why?

1141
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,540
...you'll find...

1142
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,420
...it's normal...

1143
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,460
...in this recording...

1144
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,800
...and it's that normality that we must fight...

1145
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,000
...in the new bulletin number 125...

1146
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,060
...always on the green inside...

1147
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,740
...the conspiracy itself is that way of a formality...

1148
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,000
...some people see it as normality...

1149
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,780
...as a metaphor...

1150
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,140
...published and brought about by the Cinema Educational Guild...

1151
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,260
...now they say Bob Dobbs is just a man...

1152
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,860
...and nothing good...

1153
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
...and still are...

1154
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,500
...used to brainwash the people...

1155
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,160
...he has friends up in the sky...

1156
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,480
...he's immortal and can fly...

1157
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,000
...otherwise he's just a guy like me and you...

1158
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,160
...so keep on the green inside...

1159
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
...always on the green inside...

1160
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,540
...keep on the green inside of Bob...

1161
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,860
...he looks playful like your dad...

1162
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,980
...but don't you ever make him mad...

1163
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,160
...just keep on the green inside of Bob...

1164
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,240
...there's a dead armadillo on the road...

1165
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,780
...and Bob's bumper...

1166
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,960
...it hit it fair and square...

1167
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,300
...there's a twinkle in his eye...

1168
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,340
...not a tear as he drives by...

1169
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,160
...a ghostly old Bob Dobbs...

1170
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,140
...he just don't care...

1171
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,160
...so keep on the green inside...

1172
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,440
...always on the green inside of Bob...

1173
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,760
...keep on the green inside of Bob...

1174
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,540
...there is nothing left to fear...

1175
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,640
...you'll preserve all you hold dear...

1176
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,340
...when you keep on the green inside of Bob...

1177
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,700
...and if you just stop and pass a fan...

1178
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,840
...whoop whoop whoop whoop...

1179
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,080
...whoop whoop whoop whoop...

1180
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,340
it's Bob Dobbs Rick!

1181
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:13,960
Carawelluter!

1182
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,620
...and without André in response there is...

1183
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,740
...Thereslink!

1184
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,440
...and there's a story for you...

1185
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:22,580
...that's not really strong as it seems...

1186
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:22,760
...but vititiously an income not to have...

1187
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,540
...that's just what it is...

1188
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,680
... Destroy like the tμ and bring it along...

1189
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:25,680


1190
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,340
... ceramic and dilute and all the stuff...

1191
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,460
...that's what we need inật's power.

1192
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,100
Right, it's gonna be better soon.

1193
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,100


1194
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,280
...I'll upset Without lobotic privilege...

1195
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,900
...but pay some attention if you want...

1196
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,300
...for solution or I'm not sure delicious...

1197
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,560
...you can mushrooms!

1198
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,180
...other wrapped up in 있잖아요 verified.

1199
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,060
...we did it at the first draft instead of t-

1200
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,060


1201
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,260
Bob Dobbs could be back at any minute.

1202
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Have a good one.

1203
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:51,380
On the day of reckoning, you don't want to find out you drifted over to the wrong side of the battle line without even knowing it.

1204
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
24-7.

1205
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,440
365.

1206
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,060
I can't picture anything now.

1207
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,360
Oh, look, I've wet myself.

1208
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,680
Oh, help me away from here.

1209
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,500
Long cow, Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1210
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,800
Yes.

1211
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,500
It's all been done.

1212
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,700
It's all been done before.

1213
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,720
It's all been done.

1214
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Oh, back in the days of the great, you know, the Middle Ages.

1215
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,640
It's all been done before.

1216
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,560
Nothing new under the sun.

1217
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,940
Nothing new under the sun.

1218
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,920
No, you can't find.

1219
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,880
You know, look, the word is magical.

1220
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,880
One word, slack.

1221
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:28,360
Huh?

1222
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,700
You think that's going to give you something?

1223
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:30,940
Slack.

1224
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,220
It even feels good to say it.

1225
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:34,760
Is it an adjective?

1226
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,480
Slack.

1227
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,240
It's a noun.

1228
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,380
To slack.

1229
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,060
No, that's a verb.

1230
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:39,860
To slack.

1231
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,480
On slack.

1232
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:40,940
On slack.

1233
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,540
And a quicken.

1234
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,280
A quicken and slack.

1235
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,000
And a quicken and slack.

1236
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,680
Hey, slack, hey.

1237
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,700
That's an adjective.

1238
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,160
I need more slack.

1239
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,460
That's a noun, yes.

1240
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,560
So far, we're pushing three.

1241
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
How about this one?

1242
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,840
I want to, uh, subjunctive noun.

1243
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,500
I want to slack you, baby.

1244
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,080
I don't know.

1245
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,620
How do you like your slack?

1246
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,240
Over easy?

1247
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,700
Over easy?

1248
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,260
Too easy?

1249
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,220
That's just a...

1250
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,740
Just a...

1251
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,420
What's a giant going to do to you at the top of the beanstalk?

1252
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, he's going to make...

1253
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,320
He's going to...

1254
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,640
The giant is going to deliver us.

1255
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,960
Get some dipping sauce going.

1256
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,200
We're all food.

1257
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,180
Be-fi-fo-fub-me-nius.

1258
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,280
I smell the brains of a stupid subgenius.

1259
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,140
Mmm.

1260
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,520
Mmm.

1261
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,280
Hi.

1262
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,940
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.

1263
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,700
There we go.

1264
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,360
Jack and the beanstalk again.

1265
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,960
There's no way...

1266
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,180
It...

1267
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,500
See...

1268
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,540
I was at beanstalk.

1269
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,200
Listen, we're into mythological...

1270
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,460
You know, you read like Campbell.

1271
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,320
I saw a giant's kidney at beanstalk.

1272
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,420
I'm quoting scripture.

1273
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,060
I saw Pinto Hendricks and the black beans.

1274
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,500
I was at beanstalk, man.

1275
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,720
I was only 17.

1276
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,060
I went around topless.

1277
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,900
I saw Abbot Willis Rochado and Tito Fuentes playing the flim-flam man.

1278
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,940
You can see me in the beanstalk movie in that one shot of the crowd.

1279
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,100
I'm like this nine-point down from the left on the fourth row.

1280
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,860
Remember, he had to get that magic goose.

1281
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,720
And the golden eggs out, too.

1282
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,920
I think Sylvester Stallone was in a porno called The Beanstalk.

1283
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,360
We are just three soybeans in a pod here.

1284
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,020
It's not as silly as you think, French.

1285
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,000
There are some dark, sinister forces out there,

1286
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,140
and they're paying attention to your brainwaves right now,

1287
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,820
and you're still going,

1288
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,160
ha-ha, this is funny on the radio and stuff.

1289
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,900
Yeah, I know.

1290
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,420
You know what?

1291
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,820
Actually, you know what?

1292
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,000
They're getting even harder because, you know what?

1293
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,980
They're coming through the radio.

1294
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,820
And the phone.

1295
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,460
That's right.

1296
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,220
We've come through your radio already.

1297
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,060
Yeah, you have.

1298
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,520
And I hope you do this in time before the wave hits you,

1299
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,100
but you gotta...

1300
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm gonna tell you this because I think you deserve to be saved.

1301
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,780
You need to put on some protection for your head right now

1302
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,500
or the orbital mind control lasers will take over.

1303
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,460
I'm gonna start a radio show.

1304
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,840
I'm just looking for some clowns.

1305
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,280
You didn't hear what he said, did you?

1306
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,100
That's okay.

1307
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,080
Oh, you're just so glib about it.

1308
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,220
Just so perfunctory.

1309
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,140
It's just like, yeah, you know, I'm gonna start a radio show.

1310
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,500
You know...

1311
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,680
Didn't you hear what they said?

1312
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,880
That your household...

1313
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,000
Your household items, your chemicals, your dishwashing soap,

1314
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,800
they're listening to your brain vibrations right now

1315
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,980
and they're taking things down.

1316
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,100
They're reporting it, man.

1317
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,980
And your refrigerator is actually giving you commands.

1318
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,140
You better stop them before they tell everything.

1319
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,560
The bleach has a mind of its own.

1320
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,760
We have to tell them something.

1321
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,120
You know what?

1322
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,700
You're making me want to commit suicide on my side window.

1323
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,260
No, no, no.

1324
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:31,900
This is...

1325
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,480
This is...

1326
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
Well, you have come to the right place, my friend.

1327
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,320
You have come to the right place, my friend.

1328
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:36,760
Oh, no.

1329
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,320
See, there he goes.

1330
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,740
He was weak.

1331
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,760
He was weak.

1332
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,020
Hey, yes.

1333
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,600
Coming at you.

1334
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,000
Bob saves.

1335
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,820
Bob saves those who help themselves.

1336
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,780
He saves those who help themselves to the inventory and sell it.

1337
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,820
Oh, my Lord.

1338
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,920
Bob saves the best salesman of his flock.

1339
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,200
Dispensations and indulgences, papal ships and doctorates.

1340
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,920
They grant forgiveness and blessings to space.

1341
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,780
Demoralize our youth.

1342
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,960
Bishop Riggs and Haywagons.

1343
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,400
Haywagons and the...

1344
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,540
We're going to have fun out there at this ingenious film fest.

1345
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,440
And they have been and still are.

1346
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,620
Drive in, camp out, flip, order...

1347
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,400
You said the films were terrible, but I don't know why we should adapt these pink critical

1348
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,500
standards.

1349
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,760
The rioting Negro ship.

1350
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,300
Well, they're not...

1351
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,160
Did I say terrible?

1352
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,100
Great examples of bulldata and quite entertaining.

1353
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,380
Well, I don't think terrible is a bad term.

1354
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,760
Did you enjoy the films last time?

1355
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Absolutely.

1356
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,980
Did you have the blood and guts science fiction monster movie?

1357
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,700
Cannibal Holocaust.

1358
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,080
I didn't like that much.

1359
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,120
But how about Abbott and Costello being chased by the monsters and the...

1360
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,480
The Cannibal Holocaust was a little unnerving when they took that turtle apart.

1361
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,180
Well, you know, when you turn turtle, it automatically causes a certain...

1362
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,080
But Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.

1363
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,280
I love that one.

1364
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,140
That's a good one because in it, it shows that the monsters are all in cahoots.

1365
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,580
I think we should stick to it.

1366
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,340
There is a cabal or conspiracy of the monsters against the humans.

1367
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,580
And, of course, this makes you want to root for the monsters.

1368
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,100
Well, yeah.

1369
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,700
It makes me want to not...

1370
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,080
Outnumbered by the humans and normals.

1371
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:18,360
I think I'm going to have a moratorium on animal torture movies at our film festival.

1372
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,380
Yes, even though we'll be consuming edible animal products, we will not view more animal stuff films or tobacco films.

1373
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:30,140
But those animal products will be processed, pre-processed in a way that makes them much more palatable to the modern Americans.

1374
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,500
They're highly palatable, particularly when fried and fricasseed.

1375
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,140
Let's not beat around the bush.

1376
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,260
All I know is if you fry it, put a lot of butter and sugar on it, it's going to taste good.

1377
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,420
No sugar for me, boss.

1378
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,200
I got epizootis.

1379
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,480
We'll have the...

1380
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,240
If you got epizootis up to maxis, then you're going to have to have the crassiest day shack and frack.

1381
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,760
And we've got some of that.

1382
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,780
We're going to take the...

1383
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,360
I got my lumbago.

1384
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,920
We shot...

1385
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,380
We took the big syringe and we extracted the viscous fluid out of the middle of your lumbago.

1386
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1387
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,540
I don't like needles.

1388
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,460
You can just put that thing back in its case, Sonny.

1389
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,260
I don't need that.

1390
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,580
And that's one case where the cure is worse than the disease.

1391
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,020
Well, that's what some people say.

1392
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,240
Let me be serious.

1393
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,240


1394
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,240


1395
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,240


1396
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,320
I'd be sick if that needle has to come anywhere near me.

1397
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,580
But wait.

1398
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,240
I'd rather not...

1399
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,260
Will you be the last mob?

1400
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,920
Someone has to, my friend.

1401
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,440
Hi!

1402
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:26,320
And when the last subgenius but myself has ascended on those pleasure saucers, I will be in the lead of the end.

1403
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:35,440
Yes, I'll be there in the lead myself when those packs of untamed subgeni run amok in this sick gut blowout party ritual society.

1404
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,360
It's a frightening thought that so many rogue subgeniuses could...

1405
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,040
That's the only...

1406
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,120
That's only the...

1407
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,860
...hierarchies of the subgenius foundation.

1408
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,140
The subgenius foundation's garment.

1409
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,460
That's the tip of the rogue iceberg of real-world activity.

1410
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,520
Many cults require you to wear special underclothing or...

1411
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,340
But not us.

1412
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,500
We desire you wear no clothing, if possible.

1413
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,180
Depending on who you are, I mean, when I initiate certain subgeniuses...

1414
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:04,980
If you've got strange appendages and gelatinous, corpulent flesh, we may ask you to leave your clothes on.

1415
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,540
Exactly.

1416
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,300
Now, at subgenius clenches and other...

1417
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,320
...meetings so far...

1418
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,960
We'll be clenching freely in the woods before long.

1419
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,860
Well, uh...

1420
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,560
Clenching and wrenching our butt cheeks together.

1421
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,500
The ones who ought to keep their clothing on, remove it, and the ones who everyone would like to see...

1422
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,760
Turning water into gasoline.

1423
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,140
...sky-clad, as it were, resolutely keep their clothing on.

1424
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,040
Why stop at wine?

1425
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,460
We need to shake up these meetings...

1426
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:33,000
We turn some of the water into wine, and once we're drunk, we turn the rest of it into gasoline and drive away.

1427
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,280
...to achieve a more satisfactory result.

1428
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:34,520
Yee-haw!

1429
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,900
So that certain...

1430
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,220
You can get a copy of this news bulletin.

1431
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,960
...by important executive positions...

1432
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,260
...to be able to view a parade of young and comely postulants...

1433
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:51,880
...who would naturally be applying for the full procedure of initiation and qualification...

1434
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,340
...in which the day was tied.

1435
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,500
The Nazi hell creatures and other dwellers in the woods...

1436
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,880
...are not only capable of performing, but...

1437
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,220
Think of those special underwear that you don't have to wear...

1438
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,000
...to be a member of this church.

1439
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,340
...ordination as a deacon in the Church of the Subterranean.

1440
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,940
Those special phylacteries that aren't required.

1441
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,160
No prophylaxis will be necessary, since the...

1442
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,980
You can be fully awake and yet half asleep.

1443
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,940
Did I say awake?

1444
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,240
Fully awake?

1445
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,560
...to the postulant.

1446
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,200
In an eighth millisecond of slack, I said fully awake.

1447
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,000
It was the electroshock that caused me to say the awake word wrong.

1448
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,260
Something for nothing.

1449
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,340
That's what true slack is.

1450
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,180
One-nighted plan.

1451
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,900
This is a normal byproduct of the interchange, and should be enjoyed...

1452
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,300
...and accepted...

1453
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:46,900
...sometimes.

1454
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
So what's this guy here want?

1455
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,280
What do you want, man?

1456
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:50,720
What happened to that chick?

1457
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,280
She blew her head off, dude.

1458
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,980
Did you know the old European thing?

1459
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,120
If you step in WCSB, it's good luck, even though it inconveniences you.

1460
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,260
I heard it breaks your mother's back.

1461
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,020
Everybody's doing it.

1462
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,540
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

1463
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,220
Yeah.

1464
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,780
Don't you want to be cool?

1465
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,380
Yeah.

1466
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,960
Are you afraid your mom's going to find out?

1467
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,320
Yeah.

1468
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,020
Come on.

1469
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,800
Blow your head off.

1470
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,880
Take the gun, man.

1471
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,400
Take it.

1472
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,140
Get with the times, man.

1473
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,020
Come on, man.

1474
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,940
Just look at it.

1475
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,120
That's pretty cool.

1476
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:13,660
That is suicidal.

1477
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,580
It's cool, man.

1478
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,760
Everybody's doing it.

1479
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,840
Kurt Cobain did it.

1480
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,180
That's it?

1481
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,840
It is a true thing that everybody is doing it.

1482
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,080
We're all waiting in line.

1483
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,640
What does Kurt Cobain have to live for?

1484
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,020
Only endless supplies of money, heroin, and nookie?

1485
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,260
Why?

1486
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,840
Never done heroin.

1487
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,000
I've never done heroin.

1488
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,400
You know, heroin, nookie, and riches aren't everything.

1489
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:37,860
Obviously.

1490
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,620
It wasn't enough for him.

1491
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,120
But he did not have slack because he did not know Bob.

1492
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,560
That's right.

1493
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:51,680
However, his beautiful wife, Courtney Love, although talentless, did send her money to Bob.

1494
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:58,140
And in return, she was starred in many movies and gained some modicum of respect as an actress.

1495
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,980
That was my life.

1496
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,220
I blew my head off, too.

1497
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,180
Public statement.

1498
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,660
Praise Bob.

1499
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,000
You see, even the lowliest idiot can be brought up.

1500
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,720
On high.

1501
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,600
By the magic of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1502
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,580
And the talented, such as the great Kurt Cobain, can be brought low.

1503
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,400
Simply by their ignorance of www.subgenius.com.

1504
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,320
Well, that doesn't mean a lot when you've blown off the side of your head.

1505
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:26,740
Nope.

1506
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,280
That's right.

1507
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,360
When the push comes to shove, the bottom line is a hot pastrami sandwich.

1508
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,800
That's good.

1509
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,820
And the bottom line is Bob.

1510
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,980
More on that.

1511
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:37,980


1512
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:37,980


1513
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,240
More on Bob.

1514
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,280
J.R. Bob Dobbs, that is.

1515
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,620
From Subgenius Foundation.

1516
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,860
Post Office Box 204206.

1517
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,840
Austin, Texas.

1518
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,340
78720.

1519
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,440
Or, The Book of the Subgenius.

1520
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,020
And Revelation X.

1521
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,340
Or, www.subgenius.com.

1522
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,540
Where this show can be downloaded, if you can spell subgenius.

1523
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,720
And it has the cuss words you see in the downloaded version.

1524
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,380
Friends.

1525
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:07,520
Friends.

1526
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,940
The background music is by Automatic Robot Fish.

1527
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,180
That's a reverent angry Larry of the amino acids.

1528
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,940
Who will, I should mention, be playing at the next Subgenius Devival.

1529
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,940
The next big one.

1530
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,500
Which is in Cleveland.

1531
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,720
It's easy.

1532
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,800
Convenient to me.

1533
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,300
At the Beachland Ballroom on May 22nd.

1534
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,700
With also Man.

1535
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,260
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1536
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,980
And whatever other preachers.

1537
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,480
We can get.

1538
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,320
I'm hoping to hear from.

1539
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,700
You.

1540
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,900
Son of a gun.

1541
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,160
You thought I was going to say son of a bitch, didn't you?
