00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,400

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,400


14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
Bye!

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,240
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:28,220
But you'll be glad to know that we're not going to just do the same old three Christmas Hour of Slack show reruns in a row.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,580
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,320
Except that actually it's not the whole first half will be largely peppered.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:53,720
A new Christmas sickness for the holidays and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

20
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,120
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,540
Selling, yes! Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,360
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,840
Thank you.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,340
Ah, yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,800
It's cool, man, cool!

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,440
And praise Bob and...

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,020
Ho, ho, ho!

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,060
Ho, ho, ho!

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:47,400
Ho, ho, ho!

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,600
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,660
And stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree

33
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,380
Ho, ho, ho!

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,400
Ho, ho, ho!

35
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,000
Ho, ho, ho!

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000


37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,140
Ho, ho, ho!

38
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,940
Ho, ho, ho!

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,260
Ho, ho!

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,500
Ho, ho, ho!

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,580
Boo!

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,620
Who pooped the stump in my romp-a-pomp-a-pomp?

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,240
Who tuck and jammed it in my ramb-a-lam-a ding-dong?

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,140
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,920
Who pooped the stick up my hip-day-dip-de-dip?

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
Who was that man?

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,380
He shoved it up my can

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree?

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:32,980
Mr. Spock, ou!

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:32,980


51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:32,980


52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:32,980


53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:32,980


54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:32,980


55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
Will you stop it?

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,220
Chop-a-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-chop

58
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,040
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

60
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,400
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,480
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

65
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,160
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,880
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,020
I might squeeze him too tight

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,720
It's that psychedelic time of the year

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,660
The year of the beast

71
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,460
You know where your brain cells are

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,600
It's already 9 p.m.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,680
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

76
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
I mean, in the apartment store

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,700
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

78
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,240
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw

79
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

80
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,480
Till I get the damn chainsaw fixed

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,800
And back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,600
And I'm gonna give my boss a him

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Now you boys be good and I'll give you something to see

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,440
Apple mango pie

85
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,540
It ain't no good of a child

86
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,520
The dog's runin' off with him brain cells

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm gonna have to

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm gonna have to

91
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,640


92
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,640


93
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,640


94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,420
I'm gonna have to

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm gonna have to

96
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,300
Could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

97
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,140
What?

98
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,060
Eric Crespo!

99
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,680
What wing is manufactured with Sally is fun.

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,780
The fate of a child.

101
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

102
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,940
Spend all the money you've got.

103
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,460
The Christmas truck.

104
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,740
I've lost my freaking mind.

105
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,560
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

106
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
He's like a cowboy.

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,100
Santa.

108
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,500
How jolly.

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
Boy, I really need one of those.

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit though?

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

113
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,940
That's enough of that.

116
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,360
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,620
It's been increased in size to...

119
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Oh, your pancreas?

120
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,460
This looks lovely, Dave.

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,260
Look at swelling!

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,940
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain power.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

124
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,060
Yum.

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, those pills.

126
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,700
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

127
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,960
Ah, more pills.

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,880
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm shocked by...

130
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

132
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,640
I like to take the red one and the blue one.

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:30,640


134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,220
The red one and the blue one.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,600
At the same time.

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
The warp mix is easy.

138
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,200
Angels we have heard on high

140
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Singing about mountains new

141
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,560
And those mountains in reply

142
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,520
Saying we wish we had some too

143
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, warriors

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,900
In excelsis Deo

145
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, warriors

146
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,580
In excelsis Deo

147
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,460
Barbie dolls.

148
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

149
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,220
Barbie dolls.

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:53,100
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

151
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,040
It will empower us to resist us.

152
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,780
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

153
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,460
It will be a bomb for kids.

154
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:21,820
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes?

155
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,740
Kids, humans.

156
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,200
Good as love and muscle.

157
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,580
Good.

158
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,420
Good!

159
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,400
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

160
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires, latent in

161
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,980
children brought out through the vehicle of this.

162
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,740
So-called farmer told these boys at church,

163
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,880
Better is not good.

164
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,460
She's new, from Kenner.

165
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

166
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
We must buy our toys!

167
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

168
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,020
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme,

169
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,960
recorded there at Dockstock 1984,

170
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,880
and me and Palmer Freedies.

171
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,540
Angels We Have Heard on High,

172
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,780
it was by the Philistines.

173
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,940
The collage called All the Money You've Got

174
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,220
is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

175
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
which you can get for free.

176
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,700
Check out this website,

177
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,260
obtuse.iuma.com

178
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,560
That's Obtuse...

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,500
Excuse me!

180
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
Ah yes, and next up,

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,200
The Real Story of Christmas,

182
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,860
by...

183
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,380
Michael Shelley.

184
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,720
Michael Shelley.

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Once upon a time,

186
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
there was the baby Jesus,

187
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,960
and he had two eyes made out of coal,

188
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,160
and he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree,

189
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,760
and he wanted his two front teeth,

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,940
and he got McDonald's gift certificates,

191
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,240
and he had a dog named Santa's little help,

192
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,820
and he took all the presents from Whoville,

193
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,640
and his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys,

194
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,340
and he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy,

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,500
but he couldn't.

196
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,140
He wanted 10s and 20s, 10s and 20s,

197
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
and he got McDonald's gift certificates,

198
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,300
and he got Zuzu's pedals,

199
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,860
and that's the real story of Christmas.

200
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:20,360
The Real Story of Christmas

201
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,320
The Real Story of Christmas

202
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,920
The Real Story of Christmas

203
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
The Real Story of Christmas

204
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,900
The Real Story of Christmas

205
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,240
The Real Story of Christmas

206
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

207
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,060
No way, I'll never sell out for the conspiracy.

208
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,100
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool.

209
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,200
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe,

210
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,220
head launcher, janger device,

211
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,520
fighting Jesus and other action figures sold separately,

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,220
some assembly required,

213
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,120
Our battery's not included.

214
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,300
This toy falls apart every day.

215
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,280
He-Bob!

216
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,980
And the bastards of the universe.

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,320
Too much is always better than not enough.

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,120
The creatures in Queen Barbara,

219
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,620
when I can't douse all separately.

220
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,560
Gorgeous.

221
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,540
Seagulls can blow from head to toe.

222
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Drama.

223
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Everything you see here,

224
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
can't douse all separately.

225
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,740
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe

226
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,180
will be back after this message.

227
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,920
Santa Claus.

228
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

229
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,160
He wanted an electric train.

230
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,240
He had the whole thing in his mind,

231
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,300
even to the table where it was going to set it up.

232
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,460
He had a picture of the whole thing,

233
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,900
and he would dream so hard

234
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,480
that the whole thing would come to life

235
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,540
right before his eyes.

236
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

237
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
And what he started wishing for

238
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,660
was a pretty fancy-looking train set

239
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,320
with locomotives and freight cars,

240
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,420
and a station and a gateman,

241
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,960
the water tower,

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,580
and all the kinds of wonderful equipment

243
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,320
and accessories.

244
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
So grand that you might think

245
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,180
Tommy was waiting for something

246
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,260
that just didn't exist.

247
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

248
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,680
It is turnover.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

250
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

251
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh, yeah.

252
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,460
So come and get it, everyone,

253
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,380
and just buy our products.

254
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,320
Now, are we...

255
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

256
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,680
Are we...

257
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
or his death when they nailed him?

259
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

260
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,160
But the present subgenie

261
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
tried to make sure that

262
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,700
we have our inventories cleared by now

263
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,560
and sell everything to the pigs.

264
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, yes.

265
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
Once a pagan holiday,

266
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,580
and now a shopping season.

267
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,720
Before it was...

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,500
After it was a pagan holiday

270
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,220
and before it was a shopping season,

271
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,660
it was something else.

272
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,480
But I think they started a war over it.

273
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah.

274
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,040


275
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,840
Like the soap opera,

276
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,760
but now Santa won't really do it.

277
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,120
And we probably won't need to follow theaged angels

278
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,120


279
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,120


280
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,120


281
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,120


282
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,420
and I she went too far.

283
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,640
So,

284
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,760
I still don't understand

285
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,700
why Santa's left letter perchÃ©

286
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:41,580
he wants to pay this money.

287
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:41,580


288
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,020
Friends, try to imagine

289
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,460
somewhere in the snowy north,

290
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
the Santibob trudging mindlessly

291
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,480
through the Himalayan snows,

292
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,940
driven by strange forces

293
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,940
to complete his nameless errand,

294
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,920
and he may show up at your house,

295
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,920
my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius

296
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
or a halfway subgenius,

297
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,000
or if we keep getting tangled up

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
in these other shows

299
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,580
and having strange microphones.

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,640
How did that paternity suit ever turn out

301
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,220
between Dobbs and Santa?

302
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,340
And who?

303
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,460
His dad.

304
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,540
Santa dog.

305
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know.

306
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,120
I don't think it was...

307
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,140
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

308
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,420
St. Nicholas punched another bishop

309
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,760
in the nose and bloodied his,

310
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,160
in the 4th century over us,

311
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,660
over a dispute over the trinity of God.

312
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,820
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

313
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
I swear upon Bob and the house of God.

314
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,340
The heart of the country is the more part of the country.

315
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,840
I can tell you shit, God.

316
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,460
Who the hell is God?

317
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,140
Who the hell is God?

318
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Ask Dobbs one day.

319
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,860
That's the question we should be asking.

320
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,900
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere.

321
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,700
On that bright, sunny day,

322
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,700
Bob did a backflip,

323
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,080
and from that day on,

324
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,480
he too was a believer.

325
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,260
And from the snow,

326
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,600
a little child bearing flowers emerged.

327
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,080
Chip, what else is on the table?

328
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,040
Each one a dirty flower.

329
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,920
This is St. Nicholas.

330
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
Sip, sicken.

331
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,860
The historical Santa Claus

332
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,720
is originally lived,

333
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
as the caller knows,

334
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
as a bishop in,

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,220
was it Constantinople?

336
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,780
Yeah, like...

337
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Or it was an ancient Byzantium.

338
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,020
Or it was an ancient Byzantium.

339
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

340
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,060
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

341
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,260
Yes, he was, and he was, uh,

342
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
he was known for

343
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,760
sneaking into the rooms of young women

344
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,260
and leaving,

345
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,680
ahem, ahem, gifts.

346
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,500
Life-sized lumps of coal,

347
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,880
complete with a fake beard

348
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,000
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

349
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,820
complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

350
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,200
A saint he was, the girl said.

351
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,140
Well, that's to say that he had St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

352
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,900
Well, that's to say that he had St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

353
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,820
You got it, brother.

354
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,600
You got it, brother.

355
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,720
He moved all those houses through the chimney.

356
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother.

357
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,320
He knew they were sleeping.

358
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,300
They knew when, he knew when they were awake.

359
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,020
You got it, brother.

360
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,080
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.

361
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,040
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.

362
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,680
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creepin', stinkin' spy.

363
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:23,720


364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,200
What?

365
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,340
What?

366
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,720
He knows when you've been sleeping.

367
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
He knows what you've been eating.

368
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,180
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

369
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:30,700
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

370
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,680
And who keeps that belief alive in their

371
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,200
fevered, sick little brain?

372
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Madison Avenue, of course.

373
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,280
No, the surveillance community.

374
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,860
And Disney.

375
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,980
Under your direction.

376
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,740
Reynolds Tobacco Company.

377
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Miller Bear.

378
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,580
If you're bad, he punishes you.

379
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,340
If you're good, he rewards you.

380
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,860
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

381
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,760
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

382
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,460
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

383
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,260
I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know.

384
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:09,920
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior J.R. Bob Dobbs?

385
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,380
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

386
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,180
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

387
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,000
You better watch out.

388
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,420
You better not.

389
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,280
You better not.

390
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm telling you why.

391
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,180
Santa Claus is coming to town.

392
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,500
I'm telling you why.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:04,280
Santa Claus is coming to town.

394
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm telling you why.

395
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,900
Santa Claus is coming to town.

396
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:09,900


397
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,180
He knows when you're away

398
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,040
He knows when you're in bad or good

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,800
So be good in this goodness sake

400
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,620
Oh, you better watch out

401
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,580
You better watch out

402
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,220
You better watch out

403
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
I'm telling you why

404
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,300
Santa Claus is coming today

405
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
You think I'm psycho, Mama?

406
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,600
I seen my ex last night

407
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,520
We all saw X-Mas last night.

409
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,000
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.

410
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,900
It would not leave for the little shickle plums and berries dropping toxic tears.

411
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Oh, this little shickle plums are the reason that plums are the poison in the plums.

412
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,100
Material plums?

413
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,260
Biological agents?

414
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,800
Who only take...

415
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,540
15%?

416
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,560
It came with our fantastic boxes of bags.

417
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,740
And now...

418
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,860
Oh, my God.

419
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,360
Oh, my God.

420
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,440
Oh, my God.

421
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,060
Oh, my God.

422
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,980
And now...

423
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,940
Oh, my God.

424
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,340
Oh, my God.

425
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,160
Oh, my God.

426
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,860
Now check this.

427
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:41,900
Oh, my God.

428
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,100
Oh, my God.

429
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,140
Oh, my God.

430
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,160
Oh, my God...

431
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,520
A big news.

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,120
COM Drax!

433
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:51,540


434
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:51,540


435
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:51,680
I'm not the best mechanic I've ever been.

436
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:51,760
I cleanup many figures and Earthlings arefallen.

437
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,840
A beautiful church...

438
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,180
First I could possible anybody prayerancy...

439
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,520
And going to the ICBM...

440
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,860
And over millions are paying for my Ã©gal holy witnessing toeting activity.

441
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,180
Because you left me, too!

442
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,180


443
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,180


444
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,180


445
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,180


446
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,220
accommodate and...

447
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,780
You will not

448
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:09,780


449
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,140
That's two days old Christmas, a million things to do

450
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,760
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due

451
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,460
Where are my relatives, why haven't they showed up?

452
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,480
I met her at the airport, I forgot to pick them up

453
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,400
Christmas, almost here

454
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:55,380
Christmas, almost here

455
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,520
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull

456
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,340
Santa Claus is real

457
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,660
Santa Claus is real

458
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,000
Santa Claus is real

459
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,340
Santa Claus is real

460
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,640
Santa Claus is real

461
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,620
Santa Claus is real

462
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,900
Who's the hitman?

463
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,560
Santa Claus

464
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,440
Santa Claus

465
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,040
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man

466
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,020
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

467
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,920
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

468
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,780
On July 4th

469
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,620
And now you can have it all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID

470
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,640
The birth of our baby Satan

471
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,380
As told by various authors and acquaintances

472
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,740
And eclectic scholars from around the globular unit

473
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer

474
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,000
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement

475
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,240
But an announcement of the blessed anointment and birthday of our Lord

476
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,740
Zin

477
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,000
Zin

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,460
Crazy

479
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,100
Zin

480
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,880
For

481
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,340
One

482
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,960
Bright Christmas morning

483
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,860
Zin

484
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,440
Was born in a cradle

485
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,000
Zin

486
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,380
Zin

487
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


488
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


489
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


490
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


491
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


492
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


493
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


494
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


495
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


496
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


497
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


498
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


499
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


500
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


501
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


502
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


503
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


504
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,380


505
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,020
Was born in a cradle

506
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,580
To a rich man's family

507
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,080
The Rave Jesus

508
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh, I know the Rave Jesus

509
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,760
I'm partying with the Rave Jesus

510
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,820
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

511
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,800
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

512
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,420
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

513
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Let your side be light

514
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,380
From the all-out fire of the sky

515
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,380


516
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,820
Let your troubles with the outer sky

517
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,020
And have yourself a merry little Christmas

518
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:44,600
From now on a few miles away

519
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,680
From now on a few miles away

520
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,780
Once again

521
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,360
As in old times, I'll be back in time

522
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,280
Once again

523
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,320
And the world will see me

524
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,220
Happy golden

525
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:13,040
I'll have a sight

526
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,920
The Jackholms following

527
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,080
Happy golden

528
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,560
Happy golden

529
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,560


530
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,560


531
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,560


532
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,420
Merry Christmas

533
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,560
And a go surprising gift

534
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,740
From Mutated Christmas, friends,

535
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,180
have yourself a merry little Christmas by No-L.

536
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,880
No-L.

537
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,320
Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

538
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,040
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

539
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm playing a lot from that.

540
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,160
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

541
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,480
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

542
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,940
And now, the Jethro's.

543
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,660
The Tarkin Records.

544
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,080
The Tarkin Records.

545
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,200
Oh, yeah.

546
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,860
Wow.

547
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,960
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

548
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,840
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

549
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,120
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless hitchhikers.

550
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,120
Hideous errands.

551
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,520
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

552
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,740
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

553
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,220
Oh, friends, it's tough.

554
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,120
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

555
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,600
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

556
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,060
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that,

557
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,800
that,

558
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,760
Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

559
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,700
Can you believe that?

560
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:30,540
They asked, the kids were asking if their parents, if, if, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

561
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,240
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

562
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,240
We can't afford that.

563
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,200
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

564
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

565
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,220
.

566
00:31:49,140 --> 00:32:19,140


567
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,780
I have no kids.

568
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,320
.

569
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,340
That's fair to give our kids a rub-a-bum-bum.

570
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Rub-a-bum-bum.

571
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,580
Rub-a-bum-bum.

572
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,280
.

573
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,680
And, uh, amazing.

574
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,860
More from Corporal Blossom.

575
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,540
I am really impressed by their editing work.

576
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,500
And that's on Corporal Blossom and the mutated,

577
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,100
uh,

578
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,460
Christmas is, uh, on the illegal art label.

00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,280

You're blaming our Lord.

600
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,780
I sort of understand because I understood the way any old fool would understand.

601
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,140
There was no Jesus, no flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

602
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,720
It's not that you don't want to, it's that they won't let you.

603
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,840
No, they're ashamed.

604
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,600
Just a cry in the wilderness.

605
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,540
They're ashamed.

606
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,020
In the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the background.

607
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm ashamed of them.

608
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,780
It's cold.

609
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm leaving that city life behind and radio people are crazy.

610
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,060
I can't get my noodle back in the pan, Jan.

611
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,180
Come on, cowboy.

612
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
No, man.

613
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:40,840
I was.

614
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm trying to hear a can against this here tree and it started whispering to me, man.

615
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh, you've been drinking.

616
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,260
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

617
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,740
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

618
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,800
I swear to God, look at it.

619
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,860
Isn't it?

620
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,160
What?

621
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,040
It's her Christmas.

622
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,280
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

623
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Wow.

624
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,900
A Christmas witch?

625
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,600
I'll be whole and snuggled.

626
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,440
She's beautiful.

627
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,300
Oh my God, yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more witchy than angelic.

628
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,320
I know she must be a true witch.

629
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,420
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing down for real.

630
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,360
She's running by hovering Christmas.

631
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,840
Christmas ornaments.

632
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,060
It looks like a radar device.

633
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,560
What?

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,720
Yo.

635
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,840
Yo?

636
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,260
It's her.

637
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,140
What up?

638
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,040
Nothing.

639
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,420
Shut up.

640
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,020
What's up?

641
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,740
What house?

642
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,860
What a deep voice.

643
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,380
What's up?

644
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,500
First Christmas witch.

645
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,280
Today is definitely a Christmas since Rider Rider.

646
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh, see her face?

647
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,320


648
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,320


649
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,320


650
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,120
Aetzel ho.

651
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,220
officers.

652
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,160
Any student B dictionary will just drop in.

653
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


654
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


655
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,660
Wait, is this Timothy Mi'kmaq?

656
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:03,920
No, no.

657
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,440
We should ask Timothy.

658
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,760
Let's see who made this, expect our advertising device?

659
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,920
Say hello to Texteria Sport.

660
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,520
Thank you.

661
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,140
Thank you.

662
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,680
Thank you.

663
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,220
Thank you.

664
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,220
Thank you.

665
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,500
Thank you.

666
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,940
Thank you.

667
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
Thank you.

668
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you.

669
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Thank you.

670
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,580
Thank you.

671
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,440
When your little brother

672
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
fell through a hole

673
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,120
and you went and saved

674
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,140
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

675
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,340
It was a wonderful life back then.

676
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,980
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.

677
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,180
Scott, you made your choice.

678
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,640
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

679
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:48,580
And to your eternal soul, you have found that I only could you afford to give to God that which was his.

680
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,580
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

681
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,860
The Senate still stands.

682
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,240
In the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

683
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,540
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

684
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,780
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

685
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,020
Sir, no.

686
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,140
I don't want to go to hell.

687
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,000
I don't want to go to hell!

688
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,020


689
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:18,900
No!

690
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,280
No!

691
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,320
No!

692
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,520
No!

693
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,080
And the children say you could laugh and play just the same.

694
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,440
You and me.

695
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,700
The tail bearer will be at the judgment.

696
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,400
Thank you.

697
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,280
Thank you.

698
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,280
The tube marks certainty in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

699
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.

700
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,460
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage.

701
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,260
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

702
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,600
He got dancer and prancer with an old German luger.

703
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,540
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

704
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,180
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer.

705
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,240
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

706
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,820
The Nonsense.

707
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,540
Santa went crazy.

708
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,180
The nitrous crinkle went nuts.

709
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,920
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping in reindeer guts.

710
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,380
There's a National Guard and the FBI.

711
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,060
There's a van from the Iowa News.

712
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,440
And helicopters circling around in the sky.

713
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,100
And the bullets are flying.

714
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,580
The bodyguards rising.

715
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,140
And everyone's dying to know.

716
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,000
Santa, why?

717
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,180
My, my, my, my, my, my.

718
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,140
You used to be such a jolly guy.

719
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,620
He knows when you're sleeping.

720
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,800
He knows when you're awake.

721
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,320
He knows when you're down.

722
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,680
You're good.

723
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,860
So be good, for goodness sake.

724
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out.

725
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,040
You better not cry.

726
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,500
You better not pout.

727
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm telling you why.

728
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,020
Santa Claus is coming to town.

729
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,520
Santa Claus is coming to town.

730
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:22,380
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.

731
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,900
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that.

732
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,540
But now...

733
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,180
Who gave the Lord the Claptrap?

734
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,660
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

735
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,600
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

736
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,660
My one good little...

737
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,380
Well, officially in the Jesus season.

738
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,680
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...

739
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

740
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:47,960
Jesuses?

741
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,960
Yeah, how many can you bag?

742
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,860
How many messiahs can you bag?

743
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,680
If you're doing it in season...

744
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,700
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

745
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, you never do that.

746
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
And you can only take one.

747
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,600
You never bag the Lord in C. You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

748
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,120
But when they're in season, it's every god for himself.

749
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,260
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

750
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,440
Obviously.

751
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,240
We are between a rock and a hard place.

752
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,180
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?

753
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elphantiasis of the rectum.

754
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,720
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

755
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,580
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

756
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,360
Well, I like the story...

757
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,880
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know...

758
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,920
Tames the West.

759
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,320
I like when he moves into a trailer park and cowboys walk with his dog.

760
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,500
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army!

761
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,700
The Ranger. I like the...

762
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,000
The Texas Ranger. Jesus, Texas Ranger.

763
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,300
Johnny Rebel was a Jesus!

764
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,580
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

765
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,960
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

766
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,600
Man.

767
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,560
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

768
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,900
Well, what about old Peacemaker?

769
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,340
The...

770
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,260
Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually a Huron.

771
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,940
A Huron.

772
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,380
You didn't know that, did you?

773
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you!

774
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,360
Thin Ron.

775
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:12,860
Jesus!

776
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:13,980
El Ron.

777
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,120
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

778
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh, it tastes like butter.

779
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,040
A new Jesus. A different Jesus.

780
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,340
It tastes like crappy pie, children.

781
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,300
A pot smoking Jesus!

782
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,420
Hey, Dave, you know where it is. Go kick that window open.

783
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,480
I already kicked it. I'll kick it again, though.

784
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,980
Kick it good this time.

785
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

786
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,000
We hope that...

787
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,180
Slappy.

788
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,000
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

789
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,400
Clapping.

790
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,020
We appreciate all that.

791
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,920
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

792
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,460
That's all.

793
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

794
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,660
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

795
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,120
Right.

796
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,380
I could hear him say that.

797
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,320
Praise God and Bob and Jesus and...

798
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,460
And Bob.

799
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
And Jesus and Tony and...

800
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,160
Next topic.

801
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,800
And the devil and...

802
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,580
Next topic.

803
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:07,580


804
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,360
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

805
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,820
And science and...

806
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,500
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it? That was...

807
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,540
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

808
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell.

809
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,100
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

810
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,220
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

811
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,360
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

812
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,160
We're gonna break our necks.

813
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,780
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

814
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,340
Sleigh ride to heck.

815
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,100
Sleigh ride to heck.

816
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,880
Sleigh ride to heck.

817
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,300


818
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,180
The elves are full of cheer.

819
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,340
The kids are in hibernation.

820
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


821
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


822
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


823
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


824
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


825
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


826
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


827
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


828
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


829
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


830
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,340


831
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,760
are tucked in bed

832
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,720
Santa ain't

833
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,440
coming we're on a

834
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,280
sleigh ride to

835
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,560
heck

836
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,080
their dreams are filled with toys

837
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,040
but they're

838
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,700
out of luck

839
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,180
cause Satan's taking

840
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,400
Santa on a

841
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,100
sleigh ride to

842
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,960
sleigh ride

843
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,880
to heck

844
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,440
sleigh ride

845
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,540
to heck

846
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,100
sleigh ride

847
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:35,940
to

848
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,560
heck

849
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,660
the greatest

850
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,600
scary Christmas song

851
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,480
ever friends from his new album

852
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,920
Don't Trust Whitey

853
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,960
James Kochalka

854
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,260
Superstar

855
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,200
you know see a subgenius

856
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,460
has so much faith

857
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,240
that he

858
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,640
he not only can accept

859
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,580
somebody making fun of Bob

860
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,180
stomping on a picture of Bob

861
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,220
he'll do it himself

862
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,720
he has so much

863
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,620
trust and faith in Bob

864
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,840
Bob is such a good friend

865
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,320
that he can insult Bob

866
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,840
now we subgeni

867
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,400
I hate to get on my soapbox

868
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,980
in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes

869
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,420
but we subgeni may be bad

870
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,740
but our way of bad is holy

871
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,720
is holy compared to the evil

872
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,860
of so not all

873
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,960
at all by any means

874
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,940
but so many American fundamentalist,

875
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,460
charismatic evangelicals,

876
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,180
et cetera in general

877
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,920
of course

878
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,220
they and their corresponding types

879
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,800
in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, et cetera

880
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,040
if you ask me

881
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,900
are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve

882
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,320
wolves in sheep's clothing friends

883
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,980
just like Jesus warned about

884
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,460
I'm

885
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,360
we're

886
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,740
Jesus and Bob

887
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,520
like we say

888
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,640
our old drinking buddies

889
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,940
got nothing against Jesus

890
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,860
it's just his fan club

891
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,920
and now we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve

892
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,700
he's more like the smear on God's handkerchief

893
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,580
just like you or me

894
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,900
but the uptight rival cults

895
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,620
they don't think God has a handkerchief

896
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,240
uh-uh no

897
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,780
because God's perfect

898
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,540
he doesn't even sneeze

899
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,640
we're made in his image

900
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,540
except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us

901
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,760
we have to go in the secret room

902
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,180
the bathroom

903
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,100
to do awful things

904
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,340
but God, oh he's clean and pure

905
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,660
according to them

906
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,480
oh and he's male

907
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,180
but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do

908
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,960
because we sin

909
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,360
oh yeah we all sin

910
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,300
we're bad

911
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,180
we're worthless

912
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,960
we're no good to God

913
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,060
unless we sign a contract with his agent

914
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,180
we interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement

915
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,880
we turn

916
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,860
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message

917
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,920
Santa Claus is coming

918
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,660
Santa Claus is coming

919
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,340
Santa Claus is coming

920
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,140
Santa Claus is coming

921
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,940
Santa Claus is coming

922
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,440
Santa Claus is coming

923
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,460
Santa Claus is coming

924

00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:29,460


938
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:29,460


939
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,440
Oh

940
00:51:59,460 --> 00:51:59,580
Oh

941
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,060
Oh

942
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,960
Hey

943
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,600
Oh

944
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,040
Why

945
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,280
Hey

946
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,640
Hey

947
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,020
Oh

948
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,240
Oh

949
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,900
Oh

950
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,360
Oh

951
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,460
Oh

952
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,340
Oh

953
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,460
Oh

954
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,460
Oh

955
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,600
Oh

956
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,840
the angel voices

957
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,060
Oh night

958
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,460
divine

959
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh night

960
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,220
when Christ was born

961
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,400
Oh night

962
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,120
Oh night

963
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,280
divine

964
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,700
Oh night

965
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:21,700


966
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:21,700


967
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,120
O

968
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,340
O

969
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,440
Mithras won his fight.

970
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,260
Ho, ho, ho.

971
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,820
Ho, ho, ho.

972
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,320
Come on, come on.

973
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,500
It's He-Bomb.

974
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,540
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty Satinus Rice overthrow the evil normals

975
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,860
with new Bob-Dob's action figure with Rockin' Pie.

976
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,260
What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dob.

977
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,680
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you, no?

978
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,360
I'm a chocolate spice cadet.

979
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,640
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

980
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,100
Feeling face-free.

981
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,300
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

982
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,900
Now so trumpety.

983
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,860
Mmm, smells cocoa.

984
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,920
This cocoa.

985
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,700
Blow.

986
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,920
Well, friends, what do you think?

987
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,200
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

988
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,600
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

989
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,620
as he's been referred to in some early films?

990
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,240
Pre-scriptures?

991
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,280
We're getting so separate.

992
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,340
We're getting so separate.

993
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,600
Pre-scriptures?

994
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:01,600


995
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:01,600


996
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,100
We're getting so separate.

997
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,780
The Jethro's, friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

998
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,300
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

999
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:19,740
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

1000
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,040
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

1001
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,860
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

1002
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,620
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

1003
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:27,620


1004
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:27,620


1005
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:32,620
H-O-3-8-O-1.

1006
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,320
Santa Claus is Coming to Town was by Corporal Blossom.

1007
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:46,280
Information on that mutant Christmas is available from www.triagemusic.com

1008
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:54,180
or www.detritus.net slash illegalart.

1009
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, friends.

1010
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:08,220
You can reach me, send me tapes or whatnot at Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1011
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,600
And friends, as always, the Hour of Slack is brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

1012
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,480
www.subgenius.com

1013
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,640
It's all Christmassy right now.

1014
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,660
There's a bright green bob in the window.

1015
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:23,860
There's a little bell in the window.

1016
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,040
And a...

1017
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,160
And a...

1018
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Is there a light out there?

1019
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:25,540
And Christmassy lights.

1020
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,740
Is there a DJA?

1021
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,960
Is DJA out there?

1022
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,600
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1023
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,820
No, that's something just left for DJA.

1024
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,860
It's all Christmassy.

1025
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:41,320
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present.

1026
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,800
Under the tree.

1027
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,820
Smell that cinnamon.

1028
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,500
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1029
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,420
And those sugar plums.

1030
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,720
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's, isn't it?

1031
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,440
Yeah.

1032
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,840
Of Santa, I mean.

1033
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,380
Otherwise.

1034
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,240
Gosh.

1035
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,340
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1036
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, beloved Santa.

1037
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,100
I have wanted to...

1038
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,380
Put your bag down for a minute.

1039
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,820
It's always so ready to let him be.

1040
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,480
What?

1041
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,420
For so long.

1042
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,120
Hi, Bob and Mary X-mas!

1043
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:23,360
Hi, Bob and Mary X-mas!

1044
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,700
Bye, Bob and Mary X-mas!

1045
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,080
extra

1046
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,060
pro

1047
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:45,920
It's another day on Peter Pan, Tampa, specifically,

1048
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:45,920


1049
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,180
Just said to him on the top left.

1050
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,160
Why?

1051
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,700
To tell him that Antoine really is trying to sell,

1052
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:49,700


1053
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:49,700


1054
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:49,900
More decir-

1055
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:49,900


1056
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,100
Emergency police emergency.

1057
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,480
Yes.

1058
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,340
zem cicle, there's a noise.

1059
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,340


1060
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,380
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1061
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,980
Don't despair just because it's Christmas

1062
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,240
Children there are so gay at Christmas

1063
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,320
All the children on the street

1064
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,140
Hope they get something good to eat

1065
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,260
But for me it's not so great

1066
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,180
Fuck Christmas!

1067
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,400
Fuck Christmas!

1068
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,680
Fuck Christmas!

1069
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,000
Fuck Christmas!

1070
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,240
Fuck Christmas!

1071
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,460
Fuck Christmas!

1072
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,580
Fuck Christmas!

1073
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,740
Fuck Christmas!

1074
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,080
What a night!

1075
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,760
Right before Christmas and all through the house

1076
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,900
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

1077
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,060
The stockings were hung by the tree

1078
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,520
Merry fucking Christmas

1079
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,200
Merry fucking Christmas

1080
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,060
Merry fucking Christmas

1081
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,600
Merry fucking Christmas

1082
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,160
To you!

1083
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,960
Merry fucking Christmas

1084
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,860
Merry fucking Christmas

1085
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,820
Merry fucking Christmas

1086
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,840
Merry fucking Christmas

1087
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,520
Merry fucking Christmas

1088
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,220
Merry fucking Christmas

1089
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,840
Thank you.

1090
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:29,740
Thank you.

1091
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,500
Thank you.
