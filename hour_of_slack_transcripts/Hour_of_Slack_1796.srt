1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm drinking alcohol, including whiskey.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,000
PR's report reports that I'm not dangerous.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,120
They can drink up without fear.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:17,080
A rescue ship carrying inappropriate government officials and alcohol industry executives say they were PR News, Washington.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,400
What's it going to be, eh?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,640
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,680
Or are you going to attend to the divine word?

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,280
The So Genius.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
The Power of...

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,140
What?

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,620
This is some new form of torture.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,100
Say it, brother, sir.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,120
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,040
What the hell do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,500
Dragging your butt through the day.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,800
Selling your body and your soul to a bunch of bland normals.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,420
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm tired of getting up.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm tired of all the guilt.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,160
But none of the sex.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,900
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,940
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,720
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master at his church of the So Genius.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,520
Praise Bob.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,980
Bob brings a new destiny to the abnormal.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,860
Bob comes to Just a Bob.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
He's the one who's gonna destroy our sins.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,360
To unmask the conspiracy.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,220
And to get us back the slack they stole away.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,440
It's us, sir, says them.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,300
Are you going to fry in hell alongside the pink boys?

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,140
Or are you going to pull the wheel over your own eyes?

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
And accept Bob into your mind?

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
And repent?

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,620
And go in your nab?

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,760
Slack off and...

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,980
Praise Bob.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
The church of the So Genius.

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,900
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh yes, dear friends.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,060
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1796.

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,860
Thank you, Leemur, for the opening credits.

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,920
And the piece we started off with was by Santiago Trejo.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,660
Probably Reverend Santiago Trejo.

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,620
I'm not sure I got that off of one of the Facebook...

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,980
One of the subgenius Facebook pages.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,540
The number of which is too damn high.

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,960
Our music in the background right now is the Swingin' Love Corpses from the Bay Mixes tape.

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,740
And on and off during this show we're gonna be reading from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,760
That's a kind of a newspaper that you get if you...

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,960
If you get anything in the mail from Subgenius.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
All the membership packs have them.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
And basically if you...

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,600
Anybody who gets a face mask or book or anything at all from us gets the Dobbs Town Mirror.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,040
And some cool stickers.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,740
All of which are courtesy of Mayor Uncle...

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,220
Uncle Onan Canobite and Dr. Philodrumon.

58
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,900
But Mayor Canobite is the mayor of Dobbs.Town.

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,560
Which is a forum on the internet for Subgenius members only.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,960
But the Dobbs Town Mirror is in a printed thing.

61
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,420
This one's from August of 2020.

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,720
And what you find in the Dobbs.Town Mirror...

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,460
Are things to see, say, do and buy.

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,460
Oh no. Things to see, say, do, think, know and buy.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm sorry. I looked away for a minute to check my volumes.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,200
Things to see, say, do, think, know and buy.

67
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,280
From the Dobbs Town Mirror. Greatest offer yet.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Friends, the church of the Subgenius is happening now.

69
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,920
You probably missed Dada, Surrealism and Fluxus.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,400
You probably missed Hippie, Punk and Rave.

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,520
You probably missed Jonestown, Waco and Heaven's Gate.

72
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,480
But the church of the Subgenius is happening now and you haven't missed it!

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:51,940
The best mail order mind control cult at this price range is yours to join and mutate to your own ends today.

74
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,700
If you will.

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,360
We'll but decide you're not going to put your slack off any further.

76
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,040
X Day approaches.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,980
The church of the Subgenius, friends.

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,940
Taking the bore out of being born.

79
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:13,100
What other mind control cults put you in the driver's seat with two steering wheels?

80
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,680
Don't forget the

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,680


82
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,680


83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Ol

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Fear keeps us safe from the light

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,620
Why would anyone open their eyes?

86
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Till the night

87
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,080
All hours are lost

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,220
All hours are lost

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,860
All hours are lost

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,140
Money and war

91
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,240
Humanity fucked from the start

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,660
Till the night

93
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,640
All hours are lost

94
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,100
Till the night

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,360
All hours are lost

96
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,240
Till the night

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,880
All hours are lost

98
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,920
All hours are lost

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,220
All hours are lost

100
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,340
All hours are lost

101
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:49,700
All hours are lost

102
00:08:49,700 --> 00:09:18,540
All hours are lost

103
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:43,740
All hours are lost

104
00:09:43,740 --> 00:10:13,720
All hours are lost

105
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:43,700
All hours are lost

106
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,420
All hours are lost

107
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,560
All hours are lost

108
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:11,920
All hours are lost

109
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,780
All hours are lost

110
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,740
This is not a joke

111
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,480
My dear, we're gonna drown

112
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,520
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down

113
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,520
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down

114
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,180
Yeah, we're gonna drown

115
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,220
Drown, drown, drown, drown

116
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,060
Slash and burn and scorch the earth

117
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,800
Every time, can't we get it right?

118
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,460
We breed it fine and eschatize

119
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,260
Make up your mind, can't we get it right?

120
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,980
Stranger in that frowning ancient mind

121
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,960
Be kind, rewind, don't go to the light

122
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,180
Any hope, it's a violent call

123
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,760
The blurt is and the fool

124
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,340
Grifters and shoggies crash the game

125
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,600
The best ultra-glon-noo-oo

126
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,780
All good and fun, but this is not

127
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,200
A pretty white world

128
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,560
And this is not

129
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,880
A coke and a smile

130
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,320
And this is not

131
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,520
A dope flaky light

132
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,660
Dude, we're gonna drown

133
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,520
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

134
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

135
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,440
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?

136
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah, we're gonna drown

137
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,460
Drown, drown, drown

138
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,800
Drown, drown, drown

139
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:47,800


140
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,020
Thank you.

141
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
Thank you.

142
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,340
Bob and the Exists have access to the Book of Life, listing all paid members.

143
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:22,020
The likes of you and I, however, may never know if a kindness or cruelty was unknowingly wasted on a fellow subgenius.

144
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,500
The unusual Swingin' Love Corps version of Purple Haze.

145
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:14,820
And I ain't trying to be braggin', but I'm flying on a sub-dragon.

146
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,900
And all I wanna do is set the world on fire.

147
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,660
To watch the light bounce off your eyes is my desire.

148
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,660
Lost love through a space rift.

149
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,860
And now I'm just negative.

150
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,440
And now I'm just negative.

151
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,140
Another flaming and burning song.

152
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,940
I want to set the world on fire by Reverend Negative.

153
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,780
So very strange that in September of 2020 in the USA,

154
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,160
there would be this outbreak of songs about the world burning up with fire and sickness.

155
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,740
Jeepers. I wonder what that's about.

156
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,920
From the Dobbs Dock Town Mirror.

157
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,540
Psychic Research.

158
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:12,300
The so-called problem of evil asks why a benevolent God would allow suffering.

159
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,780
This is only a problem for mainstream religions.

160
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,740
The Church of the Subgenius knows that suffering feeds the Elder Gods.

161
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,900
And it's as simple as that.

162
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:32,500
What is frustrating to the subgenius is not that suffering happens, but that it happens to the wrong people.

163
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,520
Namely, anyone who is suffering.

164
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,220
And anyone who ever bothered us to any degree at any time.

165
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,020
Including other members of the Church of the Subgenius.

166
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,020
We welcome suffering when it happens to them.

167
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,580
Time for a story now from the mysterious Sheridan of Cleveland.

168
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,700
He has a double CD of these stories.

169
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,660
All of which had to adhere to three strict rules.

170
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,500
One, the two main characters must be opposing near and far.

171
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,500


172
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:13,180
Two, there must be at least one crass commercial and unpaid for reference to some product.

173
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,500
And three, there must be a gnat in every story.

174
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,940
This one is Adam and Eve.

175
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,320
It was a gleefully, unabashedly, unashamed morning.

176
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:47,120
And the sun shone like an overexposed tanned yellow butt in the sky with a crack in it.

177
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,300
Nets.

178
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,620
Circled Adam's yucky umbrella drink.

179
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,620
And took turns diving down the suction straw.

180
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:06,640
Like poor travelers on a Price's Wraith vacation in their first and last tube ride.

181
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:19,440
Reaching for his alcoholic pleasure, he promptly plunged the straw into his eye yet again and again.

182
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,960
And he was in the water.

183
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,280
Eve curled her straight hair around her fuck you finger and didn't bother to look.

184
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,760
She's been here more times than she's used the finger.

185
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,740
Her, always the thinking, responsible one.

186
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,220
Him, always the drunken drinker.

187
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,280
She, always the drunk.

188
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,280


189
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,580
Always looks to the potential ahead of them.

190
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,400
And he, no further than the drink before him.

191
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,900
What's the blend today, dear?

192
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,540
She casually asks.

193
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,860
Yerk pus and pomegranate pulpy, he burps.

194
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,120
And scratches his neck mole.

195
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Want some?

196
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,260
She nods and holds out her hand to accept the foul smelling mixture.

197
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,880
She grimaces and stomps the ground once.

198
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,400
From her generic dollar store lounger which kits up dust covering her tan bare foot.

199
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,820
Including the custom salon toenail paintings of butterflies and birds.

200
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,700
With a specially mixed magenta background.

201
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,220
Ground blend.

202
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,340
Not bad!

203
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,820
She shrieked at the top of her now destroyed vocal cords.

204
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,880
Not bad!

205
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,260
But needs more bumblebee anus.

206
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:11,320
Not nearly as good as your used chew tobacco jar, swamp puddle juice mixture.

207
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,680
Well, it's not like I'm a good drinker.

208
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,680


209
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,680


210
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,680


211
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,620
It's not like I'm trying.

212
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,960
It's not like I'm not trying.

213
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,560
But I'll kill you yet.

214
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,740
And no I did not just say that out loud.

215
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,080
What's that dear?

216
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:44,080
Adam, who is near sighted, lethargically reaches for his drink three times before tumbling it off.

217
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,660
The 100% solid water.

218
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,820
The only left drink of the day.

219
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,900
The most

220
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,580
And the only.

221
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,800
The only.

222
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,560
The only.

223
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:12,760
The only.

224
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,000
The only.

225
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,040
The only.

226
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,020
The only.

227
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,620
The only.

228
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,940
fact that corrective lenses had not yet been invented.

229
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:31,420
EVE disappeared with a rustling of tree branches and an inviting sideways glance into the thick

230
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,200
forest not yet protected by goddamn clueless tree-hogging bleeding-hard environmentalist

231
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,380
fucks that are way over their goddamn save-the-earth bloated heads.

232
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:56,240
Too lazy, bored, and drunk, Adam sat there and pissed himself, staining the Canadian-made

233
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,320
wicker all-weather lounger with a lifetime warranty even against, yes, even against drunken

234
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,200
pissing after a dissing.

235
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,160
Barefoot Eve leaves the trail of

236
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,360
all-weather loungers with a lifetime warranty even against, yes, even against drunken pissing after a dissing.

237
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,100
Barefoot Eve leaves the trail of all-weather loungers with a lifetime warranty even against,

238
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,180
yes, even against drunken pissing after a dissing.

239
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:19,520
As she makes her way through the woods . . . leaving a path that would later become the Cleveland Metropolitan

240
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,180
Park's memorial trey…

241
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:31,860
As she walks, tree roots stinging the soft pulp

242
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,100
of her feet, she mulls over her relationship with Adam.

243
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,500
. . .

244
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,340
. . . In her first intimate account of the series,你看 is pretty much an example of Adam's

245
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,340


246
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,780
she remembers laughing at the tiny blurry thing between his legs.

247
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,320
What's this thing do? she snickered.

248
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,560
In the first display of modesty ever,

249
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,320
Adam covered his privates with a mighty oak leaf.

250
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,720
Unfortunately, it was a mighty poisonous leaf,

251
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,220
and he applied whatever and fuck he found until it healed.

252
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,780
He then approached Eve and flicked her left nipple

253
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,200
with his mighty male dominant middle fuck you finger.

254
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,320
Eve refused.

255
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,300


256
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Eve refused to give in to modesty until she scored her victorious secret links.

257
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,040
And besides, if she had it, she was going to show it before age would surely blow it.

258
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,700
Adam turned, disheartened, and made his way back through the woods,

259
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,340
leaving Eve behind because, well, because he's stupid.

260
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,080
Eve was hungry and thirsty from her travels.

261
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,740
Eve tries to train her vision on the objects hanging from the trees closest to her.

262
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:27,320
She reaches out for food, but grasped a slimy, coiled snake instead.

263
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,880
I shall be a tattoo on your lower back.

264
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,300
I shall be a tattoo on your lower back.

265
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,800
Coiling around your round buttocks,

266
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,700
reaching down your left leg and ending at the soft tendon in your ankle,

267
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,660
the snake said.

268
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,400
The hell you say, yells Eve.

269
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,300
I have allergies.

270
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,280
It squeezed the snake's head until its eyes popped open.

271
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,760
It popped out like BBs and put the eyes out of the nearest budding potato.

272
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:21,420
Gonna need to readjust your vision plan now, bitch, she said,

273
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:28,300
as she fashioned the snake skin into a new pair of walking boots.

274
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,540
And that was Sheridan.

275
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,040
Sheridan from old Cleveland.

276
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,260
Oh, Sheridan tells some funny, funny stories.

277
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,700
And now this.

278
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,800
From the Dobbs Dot Town Mirror.

279
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,380
Rational living.

280
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,720
If nature doesn't make a great deal of something,

281
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,260
then that something is usually neither cost-effective,

282
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,260
nor quite bothersome enough to breed out entirely.

283
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,800
Like some rare diseases.

284
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,200
Like being left-handed.

285
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,240
Like high intelligence.

286
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,620
The Church of the Subgenius offers the first ray of hope

287
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,020
that there is a cure for the IQ problem.

288
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,780
Beyond alcohol.

289
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,220
Beyond traumatic brain injury.

290
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:34,520
Humans are the missing link between earlier primates and A.I.

291
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,920
The Church of the Subgenius is the missing link between earlier primates and humans.

292
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,620
And between humans and A.I.

293
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,900
Meet enough subgenii, and you'll see what I mean.

294
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,380
Many are both.

295
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,580
And so can you.

296
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,080
Stop stalking. Stop stalking. Stop stalking. Stop stalking.

297
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,920
Are there any weirdos here tonight?

298
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
What, I'll be damned.

299
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,060
Aren't there, fuck, any chance any fucking weirdos here tonight?

300
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,740
I'm so surprised.

301
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,320
Would there by any chance be any fucked-up weirdos on drugs and alcohol here tonight, my friend?

302
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,960
Well, in that case, I wanna hear a PRAISE BOB!

303
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,040
Now, there are some few of you here who may not know a damn thing about the Church of the Subgenius.

304
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,340
And I will make it short and sweet.

305
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,060
Friends, there's only three things you need to know about the Church of the Subgenius.

306
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,040
That's Bob, Slack.

307
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,840
I think some, I can tell that some of you here know about Slack.

308
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,180
But the other thing you need to know about is...

309
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,040
THE CONSPIENCY!

310
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:14,740
You know, every church has got some kind of rules and laws.

311
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,860
We only have one.

312
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,740
And I think some of you know what it is.

313
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,960
It is, fuck them if they can't take a joke!

314
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,400
And believe it or not, as cynical as that may sound, that is indeed a philosophy that you can live by.

315
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,300
The Church of the Subgenius is down here.

316
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,180
And it's a philosophy that was founded in 1953 by this salesman, this incredibly magically talented salesman, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

317
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,420
When he was seized up in the spirit by an alien space monster called Jehovah One.

318
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,340
Which has disguised itself as God for numerous religions over the centuries.

319
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:59,480
And he told Bob that throughout history there has been a conspiracy of normal people stealing away the Slack.

320
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,980
Of the weirdos, the abnormals, the misfits, the disbelievers, and most important of all, those who will believe anything.

321
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,960
Can I get a praise Bob?

322
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,520
Yes!

323
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,900
So, he founded his church not on a rock, but on a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy.

324
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,320
Because where is any religion without its hypocrisy, I ask you?

325
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,940
It's not that we love Bob that much, it's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell!

326
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,720
Yes!

327
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,280
We're crickets like any other religion.

328
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,460
Yes!

329
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,500
You know, that's what it's all about.

330
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,840
But, it is a doing yourself religion.

331
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,540
It is a disorganized religion, a non-organization for non-joiners.

332
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,880
Which makes it hard to make a buck off this thing.

333
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,880
All subgeniuses by definition are different.

334
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,060
If any two are alike, one must die!

335
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,620
So check your neighbor out, make that decision quick.

336
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,280
The only thing that we as subgeniuses have in common,

337
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,300
is that we have nothing in common with the normal!

338
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
Look at the word subgenius.

339
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,040
We didn't call it church of the genes, okay?

340
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,780
Almost anybody can qualify.

341
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,200
What we're saying is that conspiracy has been misdefining intelligence all this time.

342
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,780
It's not intelligence that we're talking about.

343
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,720
That's not what counts.

344
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:23,140
What counts is sense, common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

345
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,920
And, uh, after the show, sense of media, I guess.

346
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,440
But the thing is, Bob is not smart.

347
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,440
Wouldn't being smart ever get you a date?

348
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,340
Well, actually, in this crowd, maybe it did.

349
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,240
But what he has is luck!

350
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,800
He has luckyism.

351
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,420
The reason that Bob can do magic and you can't, is he doesn't know any better.

352
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,220
He walks the path of least resistance, friends.

353
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,780
That is his path to slack.

354
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,580
And it can be yours, too.

355
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,260
But here's the thing about slack.

356
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,880
We're not gonna tell you what it is because we can't.

357
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,580
Only you know what slack is for you!

358
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,380
Now, for some reason,

359
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,920
for some people, slack is sitting in front of the TV set and smoking a beer or whatever.

360
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Uh, for other people, like me, slack is working your ass off at what you wanted to be working your ass off at.

361
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,520
Uh, we're not here to forgive your sins.

362
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,540
Bob Gobs is not the kind of, uh, messiah that...

363
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,160
He's not that well connected.

364
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,900
And on top of that, he does not actually give one flip of a shit about your sins!

365
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,440
He doesn't care about your sins!

366
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,660
He comes not to forgive your sins.

367
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,680
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse!

368
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,180
That's all you really needed was an excuse.

369
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,100
And that is what he is for.

370
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,860
Now, he is here to bring, to bring a reminder of slack.

371
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,240
Now, slack is, as I said, it's indefinable.

372
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
You might call it something for nothing.

373
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,580
Now, a lot of people think, oh, this church is ugly and this is just all about money.

374
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,500
Well, that, too.

375
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,420
Slack is connected to money.

376
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,320
Slack is connected to sex.

377
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,460
But Bob is slack!

378
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,900
Bob is money!

379
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,120
Bob is sex!

380
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,220
And Bob is coming!

381
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,560
For boys, girls, and everybody in between.

382
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Ask not what Bob is smoking in his pipe, for he is smoking you!

383
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,000
You throw yourself into that damn pipe!

384
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,620
Bob is a short-duration personal savior.

385
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,780
After a while, you get tired of Bob and move on to the next personal savior.

386
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,060
It might be some porno star or Star Trek, God forbid.

387
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,560
The only thing, friends, that we have standing in between us and slack is that conspiracy I mentioned.

388
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Now, a lot of you folks know about the Cougar.

389
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,380
There's a lot of conspiracies.

390
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,300
There's going to be one for everybody.

391
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:54,960
There's the JFK conspiracy, the UFOs crashing at Roswell, the 9-11 truther conspiracy, worst of all, the fashion conspiracy.

392
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,740
Friends, don't worry about a one-world government or a one-world religion.

393
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,480
You should be worried about a one-world advertising.

394
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,940
That shit's going to bend you over and not even have the common decency to give you a reach around.

395
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,120
We're not asking for love, because this is a war.

396
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,620
It's really us versus them, and this time we're us!

397
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,420
For once, friends, we're trying to lead a return to decadence.

398
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,380
Not trendiness, but decadence.

399
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,940
Luckily, I won't be following that.

400
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,580
I'm going to be followed by two hot chicks and one other of the old name.

401
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,300
Who?

402
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,060
And then by an architect who will return.

403
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,200
In the meantime, friends, yeah, this is a free country, all right?

404
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,000
You're free to work your ass off, right?

405
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,200
They even have a machine now that can tell when you're thinking.

406
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,280
It's called a television.

407
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,740
And if it's off, you're guilty.

408
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,940
Friends, all we're trying to do is tempt you.

409
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,380
We're sinners away from the devil.

410
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,100
We don't give a head fuck where you go after that.

411
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,140
We believe in the God that doesn't want us to believe in it.

412
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
That's how ornery we are.

413
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,820
We are unbuckling the Bible Belt so that its pants will drop to its ankles,

414
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,680
and it will be forced to gaze unflinching upon its own private desires.

415
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,240
Ah, yes.

416
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,320
Bob said, don't just eat that hamburger.

417
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,540
Eat the hell out of it.

418
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,940
And that goes for everything you do.

419
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,700
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to, as Bob said.

420
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:43,340
And I could go on and tell you about the sex cult and the deviation and the special X-Day drills and so forth,

421
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,440
mind control that we tend to do on you.

422
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,440
But I have to confess something to y'all.

423
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,300
There have been times when I used to look out on what's normally a free country,

424
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,860
and I'd see a pretty small audience of subgeniuses, and I'd think,

425
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,640
God damn, some of these people are real nerds.

426
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:08,080
I would get frustrated at the sheer nerdliness of half of the subgeniuses.

427
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,060
But then one day, I suddenly went,

428
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,580
D'oh! That's what this is all about!

429
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,560
It finally sunk in.

430
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:23,180
Yes, they are fucked up because there really is a conspiracy of normals stealing away their slack.

431
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,720
They are fucked up, and that's why J.R. Bob Dobbs is their god.

432
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:37,460
And that is why you, you my friend, you must repent, quit your job, and slack off while you still know how.

433
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,200
Question authority.

434
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,500
I see a few people out there have been reading their prescriptions.

435
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,360
Bob is not, now believe it or not,

436
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,860
Some of you Bobbies are going to be surprised by this,

437
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,120
Bob is not the answer,

438
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,020
But neither Christ Bob is anything else.

439
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,580
But there's one thing I want to leave you with,

440
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,400
And that is that one rule of Bob,

441
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
The one rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

442
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,940
Fuck them if they can't take a chump.

443
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,760
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!

444
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,600
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!

445
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,240
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!

446
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,120
Man, we did some serious ranting back in those days.

447
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,980
That was a mix by Slander Bob from a DeVival recording of me preaching.

448
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,900
He calls it Rantomania from 2010.

449
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,300
Boy, I guess I was working harder back then.

450
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,240
Of course, I was probably 20 years younger.

451
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,100
Hmm, crazy.

452
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,480
And now this.

453
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,880
From the Dobbs.town Mirror.

454
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,620
New way to health.

455
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:15,960
Slap.

456
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,240
Slack is the force that causes people to ask, what is slack?

457
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,780
Blessed necessity.

458
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,680
Immoral?

459
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,300
Read this twice.

460
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,500
There are many moral systems and they often contradict each other.

461
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:40,260
Even if you pick one and only one and adhere to it faithfully, it is you who decided that

462
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,680
one was the correct one.

463
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,980
That makes you the arbitrator of morals.

464
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,120
You can't be the arbitrator of morals.

465
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,420
You can't be the arbitrator of ethics, morals, morals, and immorality.

466
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,560
Diversify your ethical portfolio with the Church of the Subgenius.

467
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,680
Keep your existing beliefs.

468
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,520
Add and subtract beliefs as you already do.

469
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:06,240
Except now, openly, with Slack and with JR Bob Dobbs at your side.

470
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,260
This music is the Swingin' Love Corpses.

471
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,940
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses.

472
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:14,940


473
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:14,940


474
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
Bye!

475
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,480
Howdy everybody!

476
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,540
Say Hello!

477
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,440
Hi!

478
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,280
Hi!

479
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:44,960
Hello!

480
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,880
Never as good as me

481
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,780
Personal weakness, become free

482
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,220
It's time to forge your history

483
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,780
Someone has a dark chain with a last chance

484
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,120
Inventing evolution is our feat

485
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,020
With empathetic attempts to preserve your romance

486
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,820
Without the destruction you're locked in a trap

487
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,820
Coming home is a doom there is no escape

488
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,600
Shivering monkeys obsessed with murder might

489
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,420
We unseal the strength right from magnetic tape

490
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,520
One last chance for your future for us to reshape

491
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,720
I have faith, I have faith

492
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,740
Never as good as me

493
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,640
Personal weakness, become free

494
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,100
It's time to forge your history

495
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,040
It's time to forge your history

496
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,040


497
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,040


498
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,960

508
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,400


509
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,960
Never as good as me

510
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,940
Personal weakness, become free

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:43,380


514
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,180
It's time to forge your destiny

515
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,700
Apathetic

516
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,500
Apathetic

517
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,300
Apathetic

518
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,000
Apathetic

519
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,260
Apathetic

520
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,780
Apathetic

521
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,400
Apathetic biopsy

522
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Never as good as me

523
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,040
Personal weakness, become free

It's time to forge your destiny

525
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:22,780
TNN did that. TNN is one of the projects that Dr. Argus Fox is involved with.

526
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,940
And their new album is called Standarization.

527
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,160
The swinging love corpses have been helping us in the background music.

528
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,680
And from Dobbs.Town Mirror, A Cure for Magic.

529
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Years ago, I was entering a building with someone I worked with.

530
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
She pulled some change out of her pocket and threw it on the steps.

531
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,800
I asked why. She said to her it was some change, but if a child found it, they'd feel lucky.

532
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,900
Think about how good it feels to feel lucky.

533
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,140
You know, it's like a little child.

534
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,420
You don't even have to have a lucky experience to have that feeling.

535
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,680
Seek it out. Pretend if that gets you started.

536
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Think, I'm lucky and today is a lucky day.

537
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,280
Try it for three days running and see what happens.

538
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Now, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

539
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,160
A song called Bunkum, Doubly Damned from Delicious.

540
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,480
Delicious Ass Frenzy.

541
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,480
I'm editing a nature video to go with that music.

542
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,140
But this one truth or dare, I'm client Lord cambiar.

543
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,480

545
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,720

546
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:37,180
