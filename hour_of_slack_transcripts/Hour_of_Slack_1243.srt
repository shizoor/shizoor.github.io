1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
It's been a busy month, so this hour of Slack number 1,243 is a rerun of excellent hour of Slack number 506 from August 1995.

2
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,420
Yeah, it was a great show, wasn't it?

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,720
Is that it?

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,600
You're like a crazy person.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Sound effects.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,140
There we go, with sound effects.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,080
They've been injected.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:50,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius hour of Slack.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,060
Well, Paul, keep listening.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,860
Yes, sir, and thank you, brother, and you keep preaching.

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,960
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,240
God bless.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,520
Bye.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,400
Melba.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh, hello, Steve.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,840
Hi, Melba.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
God bless you.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,940
Well, thank you.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,760
You were at the meeting tonight.

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,580
I was.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,280
I just got home about three minutes ago from North Church.

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,900
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,380
And I received such a blessing.

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,600
I was just telling the producer.

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
It was wonderful.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,540
Really?

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,720
Yes.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,560
I just have been so heavy, heavy laden with cares and worries.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,640
Really?

32
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,620
And you just, the Lord used you tonight to just lift a burden.

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,240
I just, I've never laughed.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,780
Like that.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,460
Just laughed my cares away.

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
The ghost.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,480
Oh, it was wonderful.

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,680
It was wonderful.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,540
And I enjoyed your singing, praising.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Frank and I haven't had a time like that since we saw Tony Bennett back in the late 60s.

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,080
We were swinging.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,760
Oh, I don't know.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,680
Oh.

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,700
We just, our only, you know, the only problem, we were sitting kind of close to that, that,

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,900
you know, crazy coon that kept laughing all night.

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,380
Driving us nuts.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
Well, Tony Bennett, huh?

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,340
My friend, Lucius Tate, was there.

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,000
I think she was laughing because she'd seen him outside in the lobby and he shook his

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,100
dick or something.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,560
What?

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,120
What is she, what is this?

54
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,060
One, two, three.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,100
I don't know what, what is that?

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,460
I don't know.

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,220
Tony Bennett.

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,880
That's crazy.

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,740
Hi, who is it?

60
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,880
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,500
This guy's calling.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,500
You calling from Tulsa?

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,420
No, no, no, no.

64
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,200
You're here in Dallas?

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,480
I live in Tulsa.

66
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,320
This is Rowdy Redding.

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,740
How you doing?

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, good, good.

69
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,940
I'm getting blessed tonight.

70
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,620
I really am.

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,200
Great.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,780
Here, near Boston.

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,540
I'm in a little area called Chelmsford.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,060
And we picked you up out here.

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,020
And, uh, you know, I'm a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you know, a little

76
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,140
thing.

77
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


78
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


79
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,340
And I, it's great.

80
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,500
I wanted to tell you about a fellowship we started just for Christian truckers.

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,980
Uh-huh.

82
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm a long-haul trucker.

83
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,740
Right.

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,660
And, uh, man, it's tough.

85
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,200
It's tough.

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Uh-huh.

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,820
The lifestyle a lot of these guys lead.

88
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,140
And we started a Christian ministry and outreach for, for truckers.

89
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,720
And I've, I'll tell you what, listening to your show on the radio, I mean, an area's

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,400
where I can get it.

91
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,340
It's been a real blessing to me because I'm, I'm learning how to deal with people, you

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,540
know.

93
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,220
Wow.

94
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,140
And telling, you know, telling some of these.

95
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
There's a lot of guys that, uh, you know, that are, that are, that are, uh, you know,

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
They were Christians at one time, you know, but...

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Backslidden.

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
Yeah, and they slid into this thing of feeling sorry for themselves.

99
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,580
Hey, you know, listen, you know...

100
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,860
Yep.

101
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,620
The brother Steve.

102
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,280
On the road again.

103
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,860
Cross.

104
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,540
Right.

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,440
Hallelujah.

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,440
And it's, you know, it's what they need to hear a lot of times.

107
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,120
Thank you, Jesus.

108
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,440
You know, and...

109
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,540
Because these guys, you wouldn't believe it.

110
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,780
These are guys that don't make a great deal of money.

111
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,560
They make okay money, but all these guys buy more...

112
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,520
More cocaine in a week than Robert Tilton Ministries.

113
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,000
I mean...

114
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
I don't know about that.

115
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,460
I've never heard about that, but it's okay.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah, I...

117
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,080
Well, you know, it's incredible what these guys do.

118
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
We don't...

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,660
When we talk to them, we've learned a lot from listening to Praise in the Nights.

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,020
You know, we don't let them tell these stories, you know, these hard luck stories.

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
It's like, get to the point.

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
Tell them what your problem is.

123
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,160
Shit, let's talk about salvation, you know?

124
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,460
And quit moping and meandering around the cross.

125
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,820
You sorry ass, you know, feeling sorry for yourself, Chris.

126
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,280
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

127
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,280
You need to watch your language.

128
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,340
What did you just say?

129
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,020
What?

130
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,280
What did you sorry what?

131
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,960
Oh, I said taking the sorry path of feeling...

132
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,580
Oh, sorry path.

133
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,660
Yeah.

134
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,300
Oh, good, okay.

135
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,380
Because, you know, they're moping and meandering around the cross.

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,720
Right.

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
And, you know, feeling sorry for themselves.

138
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,580
Amen.

139
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,000
I say, you know, wake up, Christians.

140
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,200
The time is short.

141
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,520
Amen.

142
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,200
Preach it.

143
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
Get your thumbs out of your ass.

144
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,860
Get...

145
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,240
Get...

146
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,500
Is that what he said?

147
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,120
Get that guy off.

148
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
There it was.

149
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,200
Man, I'll tell you.

150
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Hey, it's radio.

151
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,300
You know, good spirit, huh?

152
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,560
What is it tonight?

153
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,580
Is it a full moon or something?

154
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,960
Come on, man.

155
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,640
If you're going to be on radio, use your head.

156
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,580
You can't be full of the Holy Ghost and talk like that.

157
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,860
On radio or off radio.

158
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,700
Give me a break.

159
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Use some common sense.

160
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,140
That's right, friends.

161
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,420
Use some common sense.

162
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,900
Sorry about those awkward cuts there.

163
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,000
But, you know, that guy let a bunch of real bad language slip by.

164
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,520
And didn't even notice until the guy got to the stuff that everybody else doesn't worry about playing anymore.

165
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,400
God, what a world.

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,740
Well, that tape was given to us from Brother Russell Ministries.

167
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,420
And, you know, to tell the truth, I probably shouldn't give their address.

168
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,980
Um...

169
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,540
Um...

170
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,680
He told me to feel free to write for more info or goodies.

171
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,980
It's in that tape trading world.

172
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,780
It's a limbo nightmare world, friends, where a lot of this stuff comes from.

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,800
It's the traders of, shall we say, tape recordings of sociological experiments,

174
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:38,480
often using the telephone as a medium of experimentation upon the minds of those who listen in.

175
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,180
Well, those who are out there would be preaching, and they ain't preaching good enough, friends.

176
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,080
You're going to hear some good preaching tonight.

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,020
I don't know which, but there's always some kind of good preaching on this thing.

178
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,280
In the meantime, let's follow what that fellow suggested.

179
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,240
And, you know, if you're going to be on the radio, make some sense, okay?

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,460
Susie, Susie, Susie, I want you to croak a last few words to the listeners.

181
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,980
The listeners generally are used to hearing your sparkling laughter and clear, clear, soothing voice.

182
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,320
And instead they get this.

183
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,820
Ah!

184
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,760
Beauty is only skin deep, but slack goes all the way to the bone.

185
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,700
You...

186
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,840
I second that.

187
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,480
Me and my comic books, my comic books will testify to that fact.

188
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,460
And now, back to the...

189
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,580
The Betty Boop Scandals.

190
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,680
Professor Nuts and Bolts is one of the foremost scientists in this country, you screwball.

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,640
Oh!

192
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,080
What you hit me for, Moe?

193
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
Just trying to knock some sense into your head.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh!

195
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,420
What a soup of noise!

196
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes.

197
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
There, praise Bob, dear friends.

198
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,000
This...

199
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,620
I don't know what to call it in the background.

200
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,280
This is by the good Reverend Toe Fropphauser.

201
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,320
I love to say his name.

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,460
That's Toe Fropphauser.

203
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,460


204
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,960
Frauhauser.

205
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,340
To, Reverend

206
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,200
To Frauhauser.

207
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,940
He sent us this tape

208
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,660
full of noise.

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,100
But it's kind of cool noise.

210
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,760
It's so over-modulated

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,520
artistically. Listen to that.

212
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,680
Well, actually, let's,

213
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,180
it does kind of hurt.

214
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,220
Um,

215
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,960
enclosed, you will find

216
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,380
a copy of my stupid tape,

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Frutenfiener.

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,860
I have sent it to you in the hopes that you will find

219
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,840
it entertaining and or useful. Please feel

220
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,820
free to give copies of this tape to anyone you

221
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,760
think would enjoy it. Although I prefer

222
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,200
you send email to

223
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,620

224
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,260
or on FrappeeLand

225
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,100
BBS

226

493

228
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,020
3203 and blah blah blah blah blah.

229
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,900
Well, see? Now, Franta, if you

230
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,860
were on the internet, you'd already have memorized

231
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,300
those ridiculous numbers.

232
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
And, well,

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,580
friends, let's get religious now. Let's go

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,960
to a

235
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,340
live subgenius

236
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,780
devival as it happens

237
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,600
months ago in Cleveland

238
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,180
with live

239
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,600
on stage in the tent

240
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,420
at a big tent show that

241
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,500
Brother Steve Bevilacqua

242
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
produced, the most recent one.

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,060
Oh, this is really distracting

244
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,880
sound effect music in the background.

245
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,620
This particular sermon was broadcast

246
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,680
about four shows ago, but this

247
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,260
is different. This is the live,

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,300
live version. We broadcast a

249
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,380
studio version, I believe,

250
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,340
back about show 502.

251
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,100
This one here is 505.

252
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,580
I mistakenly called 502,

253
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,680
503. See? Now, you just

254
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,620
gotta remember to do

255
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,940
http://sunsight.unc.edu

256
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,300
slash subgenius

257
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,020
and everything will be fine.

258
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,800
It's got the western saliva in it.

259
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes, it's got your own rich, moist

260
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
Texas saliva in it. Friends, I have

261
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
a confession to make.

262
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,400
I

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,020
well there aren't many sins

264
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,660
in the church of the subgenius

265
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,820
but I committed one

266
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,180
the stupidest sin of all

267
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,100
a couple of months ago

268
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,640
I worked too hard

269
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,980
on slack

270
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
oh I thought Bob

271
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
was going to be so proud of me

272
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,940
let me tell you

273
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,460
what happened

274
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,240
it was in 1875

275
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,380
I'd been preaching in a saloon

276
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,340
in Kansas City

277
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,400
Kansas City wasn't a very big town then

278
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,760
I was

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
crawled out of the saloon

280
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
crawled underneath the saloon

281
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,360
I'd been preaching in the saloon

282
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,200
and I'd had a bit too much to drink

283
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,380
and I was crawling

284
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,000
through the muddy streets of Kansas City

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,580
it was a thunderstorm

286
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,680
going on

287
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,740
there were literally rivers

288
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,220
of shit washing through the streets

289
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,740
they weren't paved

290
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,420
back then

291
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,540
I crawled out of that saloon

292
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,080
and who should I see

293
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,180
riding by on a great big white horse

294
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,280
but J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

295
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,240
wearing a great big old cowboy hat

296
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,660
and thick cowboy boots

297
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,420
and I'm a subgenius preacher

298
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,320
and I saw my personal savior

299
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,980
ride by

300
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,180
so of course

301
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,220
I had to lick

302
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,820
his boots

303
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,780
yes I saw Bob

304
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
and I had to lick his boots

305
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,940
I'm a preacher

306
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
in fact I had to kiss him on the cheek

307
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,860
I had to kiss his boots

308
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,000
I just ran alongside the horse

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,780
licking away on Bob's boots

310
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,060
I didn't care if he'd been walking

311
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,160
through the prairie

312
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,840
stepping on buffalo chips

313
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
and pasture pastries

314
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,580
and meadow muffins

315
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,600
I didn't care if he'd been walking

316
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,160
through the horse awful

317
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,680
filled streets

318
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,460
I didn't care what was on Bob's boot

319
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,360
but I licked it

320
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,940
oh I worked hard licking Bob's boots

321
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,400
I didn't care what was on Bob's boot

322
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,940
I licked and kissed and licked and kissed

323
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,920
it was disgusting

324
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,520
didn't taste real good

325
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,960
but you know

326
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,520
when you see Bob's boot cheeks

327
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,980
you gotta kiss them

328
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,800
and I was thinking

329
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,920
oh won't Bob be proud of me

330
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,300
oh Bob's gonna be so damn proud

331
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,620
cause I worked so hard

332
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,560
for slack

333
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,500
and friends my lips

334
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,720
got chapped

335
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,060
from licking Bob's boots

336
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,520
they got more chapped

337
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,620
than my chaps

338
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,700
they were like

339
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,860
creaking leather beaks

340
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,240
I couldn't preach

341
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,940
I couldn't even smile

342
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,320
to eat a hamburger

343
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,700
I had to flatten it down

344
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,660
and feed it in through the slit

345
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,360
I had to take saddle soap

346
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,080
and rub it all over my mouth

347
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,260
in order to loosen up those leathery

348
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,380
saddle like lips

349
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,360
from kissing Bob's damn boots

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,260
for too long

351
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,040
my lips were cold and I was like

352
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
crackin' and bleedin'

353
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,980
and gettin' that lemon oil

354
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,260
and saddle soap out

355
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,820
I was sick friends

356
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,740
I made myself sick

357
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,960
working too hard

358
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,900
for Bob

359
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,860
and you know what Bob did

360
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,320
he said thanks for cleaning my boots

361
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,020
dumbass

362
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,320
and he left me with the virus

363
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
and the yeast

364
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
but friends

365
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
I then

366
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,260
learned my lesson

367
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,440
I knew what to do

368
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,020
I knew it was time to do it

369
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,020


370
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,520
I knew it was time finally

371
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,140
to truly slack off

372
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,460
I pulled out my six gun

373
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,560
and I shot Bob Dobbs in the back

374
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,640
must have been the right Bob

375
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,040
cause you know he just kept riding on

376
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,760
but I slacked off

377
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,660
and that crust on my lips

378
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,800
sloughed off

379
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
and that's why I'm here to preach to you tonight

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
and this is where

381
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,100
here I started talking about the bats

382
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,840
and it got a little bit too

383
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,660
well just a bit too raunchy but

384
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,460
I had truly learned my lesson

385
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,840
no more would I work too hard for slack

386
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,240
in fact I'm tired of doing this right now

387
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,980
maybe I ought to just quit

388
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,560
I think I'm done

389
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,260
no more wrapped up

390
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,060
in white linen

391
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,160
wrapped in white linen

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,480
as cold as the grave

393
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,880
so beat the drums slowly

394
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,500
and play the fight

395
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,000
with the bat

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,080
And thefood marches

397
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,900
you'll hear me yell

398
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
Take me

399
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,500
And even though

400
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,060
I've音ed out many a song

401
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,360
Be sure to wait

402
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,900
before I

403
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,640
break down

404
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,240
Calhoun's pee

405
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,260
and get a good roll

406
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,900
It's just about time

407
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,240
to get back

408
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,280
and show you

409
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,580
that I'm not alone

410
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,100
I got to do this

411
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,880
and of course Eddie Arnold did it better

412
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,180
but

413
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:31,980
can't get away

414
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,960
It still makes me cry, my dear.

415
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
It's so sad.

416
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,060
We've only got half an hour left.

417
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,280
We've got to have Circus Apocalypse.

418
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,720
We've got to have the head launch.

419
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,360
The head launch.

420
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,280
The head launch.

421
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,300
And we've got to have...

422
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
I've got to get this news around my neck.

423
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,160
And the testimonials.

424
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,340
And the loading shop.

425
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,400
String him up!

426
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,360
String him up!

427
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,060
God damn it, idiot.

428
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,160
Can't even tie a hangman's knot.

429
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,940
Take another pill.

430
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,300
Take another pill.

431
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,940
Well, they're going to do this song about pills.

432
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,040
This has got to be the most pill-savvy...

433
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,040
...the Bible ever.

434
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,480
It's like people are going to leave this revival going,

435
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,300
well, I thought they were going to be preaching about how evil the conspiracy is,

436
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,500
but all they did was talk about pills.

437
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,740
Take another pill.

438
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,800
Take another pill.

439
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,740
How many words can you think of that rhyme with pill?

440
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,060
Take another pill.

441
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,120
It'll cure every ill.

442
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,060
Take another pill.

443
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,680
Your brain will become nil.

444
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,380
Take another pill.

445
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,480
It will make you want to kill.

446
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,640
Take another pill.

447
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,900
Leave it on the windowsill.

448
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,880
Take another pill.

449
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,240
Put your mind through rototill.

450
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,280
Take another pill.

451
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,940
Just throw it on the grill.

452
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,400
Take another pill.

453
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,820
Fall down like Jack and Jill.

454
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,060
Take another pill.

455
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,960
The vomit will start to spill.

456
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,880
Take another pill.

457
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,700
Hey, bungalow bill.

458
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,100
Just take another pill.

459
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,820
Brew it up in your still.

460
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,040
Just take another pill.

461
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,440
Take another pill.

462
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,420
This is not a drill.

463
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,660
Take another pill.

464
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,620
It will make you feel evil.

465
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,880
Take another pill.

466
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,200
You won't be happy until.

467
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,100
Take another pill.

468
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,200
And come back for a refill.

469
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,420
Take another pill.

470
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
To do otherwise is unacceptable.

471
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,060
Take another pill.

472
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,460
To do otherwise would be impossible.

473
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
Take another pill.

474
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,080
Pickled like a dill.

475
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,020
Pickled like a dill.

476
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,160
Take another pill.

477
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,280
You'll feel like roadkill.

478
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,540
Take another pill.

479
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,420
Yo, yo, chill.

480
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,680
Take another pill.

481
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,940
Walk through the daffodils.

482
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,000
Take another pill.

483
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,300
You'll be sprouting gills.

484
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,200
Take another pill.

485
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,120
It's such a thrill.

486
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,400
Take another pill.

487
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,920
If you've been through the mill.

488
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,060
Take another pill.

489
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,460
You'll end up on boot hill.

490
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,040
Take another pill.

491
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,960
Take another pill.

492
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
Whales take them with their krill.

493
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,300
Take another pill.

494
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,480
And I can't think of any more.

495
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,420
Take another pill.

496
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,540
That's the end of it. I'm on D.

497
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,480
Take another pill.

498
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,260
I took so many pills.

499
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Take another pill.

500
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,060
This nun suit is tight.

501
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,040
It's creeping me.

502
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,440
Take another pill.

503
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,780
All these panties don't fit.

504
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,140
Wait a minute. I shouldn't even wear.

505
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
Slack can only be sold.

506
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
It cannot be bought.

507
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,500
Take another pill.

508
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,600
Take another pill.

509
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:07,760
Take another pill.

510
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,660
Hey, can you guys do golfing music?

511
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,260
Yes.

512
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,320
Cause we got us a head to launch.

513
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Take another pill.

514
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,780
Take another pill.

515
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,680
Are you ready?

516
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,940
There's many golfer heads out there.

517
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,540
There's many golfer heads out there.

518
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,760
There's people that like to launch

519
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,840
the lips of Lee Trevino.

520
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,040
The lips of Lee Trevino.

521
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh yeah.

522
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,460
There's those out there who would put

523
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,760
a rocket up and launch into outer space.

524
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,700
The feet of Sam Snead.

525
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,540
Oh yeah.

526
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,240
Jack Nicklaus tongues

527
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,380
have been launched in our public school system.

528
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,900
Damn it.

529
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Thanks to the Trevinas.

530
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,860
But when was the last time

531
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,260
you gazed, bare eyeballed upon

532
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,060
the bleeding head

533
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,920
of Arnold Pond?

534
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,040
The bleeding head

535
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,540
of Arnold Pond.

536
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,560
Oh no.

537
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,780
Ahhhh.

538
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,960
Oh no.

539
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh no.

540
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,040
The head.

541
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
The head.

542
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,020
Why?

543
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
The head asked why.

544
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,940
Notice.

545
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,060
Notice this neck stub.

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Notice this wound on the forehead.

547
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,160
They didn't just cut his head off, man.

548
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,020
They didn't just cut his head off, man.

549
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,440
They didn't just cut his head off.

550
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
Where is the sacred

551
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,960
key? Where is the holy nine

552
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,420
iron?

553
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,620
There is no sacred key.

554
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,600
There is no holy nine iron.

555
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,860
God damn it. We're just gonna

556
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,020
have to launch it without.

557
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,260
We're gonna have to boot the damn head.

558
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,980
Yep,

559
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,800
we're gonna have to launch the head by foot.

560
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,280
Alright.

561
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,700
It's a beautiful ceremony,

562
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,160
friend.

563
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,360
Alright.

564
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,400
In the name

565
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,900
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

566
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,480
In the name

567
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

568
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,360


569
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,140
of Arnold Palmer himself,

570
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,720
the true bleeding head.

571
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,420
In the name

572
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,240
of Floatats.

573
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,640
In the name of Brandon Stimpy.

574
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
In the name of

575
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,140
Jimmy Hendrix.

576
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,960
I can't do

577
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,180
it.

578
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,700
Watch that head, friend.

579
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,880
Watch that head, friend.

580
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:38,880


581
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:38,880


582
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,320
launch it back this way.

583
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,080
Launch that head back this way,

584
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,460
friend.

585
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,100
That's a five hundred dollar head.

586
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,660
Oh, it bounced.

587
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,780
And his eyes

588
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,080
are still intact.

589
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,860
are still intact.

590
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:56,920
Oh,

591
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,960
oh, oh, oh, oh.

592
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

593
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

594
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,120


595
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,820
Excuse me, friends.

596
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,880
I've seen so many

597
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,260
head launchings. That was a

598
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,240
nice head launching and

599
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
we did get the, you know, of course,

600
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,340
when you hear me doing a head launching,

601
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,740
friends, we're probably

602
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,260
using the replica

603
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,880
head. It's pretty realistic

604
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,800
and a lot of people probably don't know the difference.

605
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,620
And, you know, it's like faith healing.

606
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,540
It still works.

607
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,000
Now, on the other hand,

608
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,740
when you see Pope Sternodoc's

609
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
keycaver or Saint Jane or

610
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,680
hyperclites launching that head,

611
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,720
you better not let any of that blood

612
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,280
drip on you, my man,

613
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,040
my sir ma'am, my woman.

614
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,780
The universe would have

615
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,500
ended instantly

616
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,700
because it's just not, the time is

617
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,680
not yet nigh for their

618
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,500
arisal. But I'm gonna preach.

619
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,100
What we're really doing here, friends,

620
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,600
is fighting a war.

621
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,820
This is

622
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,760
a war. Believe it or not,

623
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,780
not very good soldiers, but

624
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,420
you know, the conspiracy

625
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,320
has something like

626
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,820
50,000 nuclear weapons.

627
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
The Church of the

628
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,260
Subgenius only has three.

629
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,700
And yet we dare to fight them

630
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:14,960
anyway!

631
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,860
Because it's always been,

632
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,500
it's always been the

633
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,920
crazy people, the maniacs

634
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
who are the only ones dumb enough

635
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,120
to fight City Hall.

636
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,920
And one of these days we're gonna win.

637
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
But it is a war,

638
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,760
friends, it's a war of

639
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,240
the humans versus the subgeniuses.

640
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,720
It's us versus

641
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,860
them. Don't you just hate

642
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,080
them?

643
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,480
And the great thing about this church is

644
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
them is anybody

645
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,620
you don't like! Praise Bob!

646
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
The subgeniuses versus the humans.

647
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,760
And you know the ironic thing

648
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,640
is, we're the ones who

649
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,100
designed the humans

650
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,000
80,000 years ago in Mutantis.

651
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,200
Our worst mistake,

652
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,960
dear friends,

653
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,600
a dreadful mistake.

654
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,440
Because

655
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,100
you gaze out,

656
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,600
go outside, go to your job,

657
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
go look around this room, you'll see

658
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,780
the humans,

659
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,980
the normals, the mediocritons,

660
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,300
the pink boys,

661
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,260
the Barbies and Kens,

662
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,640
the cage dwellers. We've got more

663
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,680
nasty words for them than they even have

664
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,340
for us.

665
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,260
Because the problem is, pinkness

666
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,840
equals boredom. The pink

667
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,700
is afraid of that

668
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,780
which is different. They are what

669
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,820
you might call xenophobes.

670
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,400
The subgenius

671
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,460
is what you would call a xenophile.

672
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,680
We get off on things

673
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,420
that are different. We don't necessarily

674
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,860
like them, but when we first

675
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,640
see them, we go,

676
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,320
weird as hell, that's disgusting.

677
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
Tell me more!

678
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,640
The pink will say,

679
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,660
string them up.

680
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,480
We wait and then say,

681
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,340
string them up.

682
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,200
But friends, it's a,

683
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,620
it is a religion.

684
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,260
Among other things, sure,

685
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,060
it's a big stupid

686
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,500
art project,

687
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,560
an excuse for

688
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,740
disgusting no good, good for nothings

689
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,880
like these guys to get up and jam.

690
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,960
But it is a religion.

691
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,100
Friends, it's a living,

692
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,260
bleeding religion for today.

693
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,460
It's not one of these old fashioned religions

694
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,680
for some guy who's been dead for

695
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
and hasn't answered his message machine

696
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,960
in 2000 years.

697
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,760
And when we talk about the

698
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,820
conspiracy, oh yeah, that's a

699
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,240
big joke, they're thinking, yeah,

700
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,300
they're making fun of those conspiracy

701
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,780
coops. We're talking about the conspiracy

702
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,340
that is so

703
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,720
dumb that it doesn't

704
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
even know that it is a conspiracy.

705
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,760
They do not even

706
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,380
know how bad they

707
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,000
are.

708
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,180


709
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,560
over themselves and much worse us.

710
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,260
Pinks, friends.

711
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,080
The conspiracy is a lot bigger

712
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,700
than Republicans versus Democrats

713
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,300
or Communists versus

714
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,140
Capitalists.

715
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,800
The conspiracy is nothing but an attitude

716
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,460
of distrust.

717
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,320
They distrust anything they don't

718
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,280
understand. And they don't

719
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,660
understand much at all.

720
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,480
Yeah, the conspiracy, it's a real big

721
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,820
joke. About as funny as the

722
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,860
headlines in today's paper, don't

723
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,220
you think?

724
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,780
Yep, it's not a clever conspiracy.

725
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,680
It doesn't even know it's a damn

726
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,120
conspiracy. It's a confederacy

727
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,880
of dunces.

728
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,000
The pinks are

729
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,560
literally stereotypes of

730
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,300
themselves. Mindless

731
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,780
bovine stereotypes like a herd

732
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,400
of cows and yet

733
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,800
they could destroy the world.

734
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,760
In fact, they may already have.

735
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,620
We're gonna destroy

736
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,520
the world too, but we want to make sure

737
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,380
the end of the world happens properly.

738
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,260
False

739
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,120
prophets, dear friends.

740
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,920
False prophets

741
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,360
surround us.

742
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,200
And the worst thing about them is

743
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,060
they call us wolves in sheep's

744
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,800
clothing. I'd sure rather

745
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,480
be a wolf in sheep's clothing

746
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,880
than sheep in wolves clothing.

747
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,680
Which is what we're dealing

748
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,040
with.

749
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,160
Now you may notice

750
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,580
that things seem to be getting a little worse

751
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,620
these days. Everybody's got

752
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,720
cancer. You get a new disease

753
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,520
every time you screw somebody.

754
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,720
There's poisons in the air.

755
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,800
The weather's kind of funny

756
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,720
lately. And the

757
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,860
world is horribly overpopulated

758
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,360
and so forth and so on.

759
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,940
You think about how bad it is

760
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,760
now. Think about what they're

761
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,160
not telling you about.

762
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,000
Well they've got all kinds

763
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
of tricks up their sleeves.

764
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
And they call the church of the subgenius

765
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,380
some kind of a cult.

766
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,080
Oh yeah, a cult.

767
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,280
I don't know, it seems like

768
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,840
if the United

769
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,760
States can get millions

770
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,740
of people to bury toxic waste

771
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,820
in their own backyards, how

772
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,600
is that any different from Jim Jones

773
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,940
getting 900 people to commit suicide?

774
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,800
America

775
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,360
is a cult these days.

776
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,160
Praise Rush Limbaugh.

777
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,880
The ATF is a cult

778
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,740
for that matter.

779
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,100
They barbecued all those nuts

780
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,240
just because they thought

781
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,180
some idiot

782
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,860
that thought he was Jesus had a bunch

783
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,360
of guns.

784
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,760
But you know the worst thing, the worst

785
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,140
thing about the conspiracy is

786
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,480
they make you think it's natural that

787
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,600
they make you want to work

788
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,080
for a living, dear friends.

789
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,100
They talk on and on and on about

790
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,680
family values, but they've got it

791
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,900
set up to where mom has to work,

792
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,280
dad has to work,

793
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,560
and the kids come home to an empty house.

794
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,440
Bob never said,

795
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,360
Bob's no communist.

796
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,900
He doesn't want everybody equally poor.

797
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,000
Bob Dobbs wants everybody

798
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,860
equally rich,

799
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,060
but without working.

800
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,440
Without working, dear friend.

801
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,520
Oh, but you say,

802
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,980
oh I don't work, but that's all,

803
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,180
I don't work for the conspiracy.

804
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm a freelancer, I sell art,

805
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
I'm in a band,

806
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,120
the conspiracy can't get me.

807
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,360
Oh no, I don't work for the conspiracy.

808
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,060
You are, everybody works for the conspiracy.

809
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,320
They've got you by the balls

810
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,220
or the ovaries.

811
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,820
All the time, and all the, right now

812
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,400
they're probably just kind of tickling.

813
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,400
They've got you on a leash,

814
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,120
and they'll let you run pretty far

815
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,840
on that leash.

816
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,500
But when they decide you've run far enough,

817
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,380
when you've got a real good head of steam up,

818
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,600
and you're taunting along going,

819
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,620
man, I guess I'm free of the conspiracy.

820
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,760
Wow! They yank that leash back,

821
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,280
and you never forget.

822
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,680
Never forget again.

823
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,700
Dear friend, you may forget

824
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,040
the conspiracy for a minute,

825
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,020
but they'll never forget you.

826
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,900
They hate you worse than

827
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,840
you hate them, and they don't even know you.

828
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,480
As Bob Dobbs said,

829
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,920
Act like a dumb sh**.

830
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,360
Act like a dumb sh**.

831
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,860
Act like a dumb sh**.

832
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,300
And they will treat you

833
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,440
as an equal.

834
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,560
Truer and sadder words

835
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,140
were never spoken, dear friend.

836
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,080
Wow.

837
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,440
Man.

838
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,220
What a devival.

839
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,760
Well, that left me feeling

840
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,600
pretty devived, I'll tell you, friends.

841
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,900
But actually,

842
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,740
it is such a joy to work

843
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,820
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

844
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,760
I don't know what it is.

845
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,320
I just love

846
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
doing stuff with those guys.

847
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,000
They're in Cleveland.

848
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,920
And they're on

849
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,560
WCSB there in Cleveland

850
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
every Thursday, what is it,

851
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,980
Thursday nights until like 10 o'clock

852
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,780
or 11. I never can remember

853
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,200
I know we go from about

854
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,840
11.30 to 1, and it

855
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
always supplies me with

856
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,700
an hour of slack

857
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,300
material that I just

858
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,460
it's just such a joy

859
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,400
to not have to do it

860
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,380
by myself

861
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,660
sometimes, you know.

862
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,740
Uh,

863
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,760
and now

864
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,720
as we come down near the end

865
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,620
of side one of this hideous

866
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,640
radio show,

867
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
we wonder what will be next.

868
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,700
Well, I'm wondering what's going to be next.

869
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,080
As I've said before, by the time

870
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,760
actually, by the time you hear this, I may be

871
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,140
back from the GWAR tour.

872
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
Let's flip this show over and

873
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,680
see what I'm going to have to listen to

874
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,460
nine nights in a row.

875
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,380
Uh,

876
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,800
starting next week for me, but in

877
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,940
the past for you because of time control,

878
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,760
don't you see? The cheap,

879
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,900
cheap, cheap form of time

880
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,540
control.

881
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,280
Who dies?

882
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,680
Her chance

883
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,880
to sin.

884
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,020
Ha ha ha ha!

885
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,100
There's the rub.

886
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,180
For in that

887
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,140
sleep of sin

888
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:10,920
what

889
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,020
kingdom may come?

890
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
What

891
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,000
of the limitless

892
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,120
sex and violence

893
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,320
in the wake

894
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,640
of Ragnarok?

895
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:26,900
What

896
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:26,900


897
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,320
of the

898
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,680
slaughter?

899
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,220
What are you going to do?

900
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,920
What will be your epitaph

901
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,680
when we get done

902
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,860
with you? Are you going to

903
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,840
cry for your mama?

904
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,260
Are you going to have a good time?

905
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,900
Are you going to be a bohama

906
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
when it's your turn to die?

907
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,700
The target's

908
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,040
crazy.

909
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,320
Ragnarok all around!

910
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,660
Karakia, Thea, Rura,

911
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,800
Street, Ragnarok, Party Town,

912
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,820
You're painting it to turn

913
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,140
in your brain. It isn't burning

914
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,120
in your sanitation. The white eyes.

915
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,500
The final hour's here. Now grab your

916
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,680
bubble litter. You're out of the gate for one time.

917
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,660
I don't only get to jump.

918
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm gonna have some fun.

919
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,340
Coming out of the blue. Cranking all the dirt.

920
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,100
The only beauty's winning that fight.

921
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,100
You're all sitting. Sitting feels so fine.

922
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,780
You're running from the tide!

923
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,900
Ashes to ashes.

924
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,520
Stop it. Stop.

925
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,140
It's always one hell of a party when Ragnarok rolls around

926
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,100
Ragnarok and roll, Ragnarok and roll

927
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,700
It's time to trash the planet, Ragnarok and man the crowd

928
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,580
Ragnarok and roll, Ragnarok and roll

929
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,720
Welcome to Valhalla, do not be afraid

930
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,020
Now you are a zombie, and all your friends are dead

931
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,480
It all gets rather nasty when you get backstage

932
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,120
Everybody takes a closer, I hope you're undirected

933
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,320
And they're joking, joking and they're joking

934
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,860
Laughing and they're loaning, loaning a lot of bombs

935
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,780
And we know you're running out of time

936
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,020
Dust to dust

937
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,740
It's always one hell of a party when Ragnarok rolls around

938
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,500
Ragnarok and roll, Ragnarok and roll

939
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,060
It's time to trash the planet, Ragnarok and man the crowd

940
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,100
Ragnarok and roll, Ragnarok and roll

941
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,600
Dust to dust

942
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,700
It's always one hell of a party when Ragnarok rolls around

943
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,880
Go out and check your city, if Ragnarok battles brown

944
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,660
Ragnarok and roll, Ragnarok and roll

945
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,920
And she's buying diamonds

946
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
stairway to

947
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,320
heaven.

948
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,140
Oh, man.

949
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,640
I'm going to be spending

950
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,120
nine or ten, no, something like

951
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,900
eleven days in a

952
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,260
bus with those guys.

953
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,260
And do you know

954
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,140
what those guys look like? Do you know what that group

955
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,640
GWAR looks like?

956
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,100
The lead singer, Odorous

957
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,500
Urungus, looks like he's got maggots

958
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,740
crawling out of his

959
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,300
face, which isn't even much

960
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,960
of a face at all. It's like a

961
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,600
destroyed skull.

962
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,000
Maggot.

963
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Demon.

964
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,880
Bottle of rum. CD.

965
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,880
Real dead

966
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
purple

967
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,720
skull cow.

968
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, man.

969
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
I've been hanging around with Doctors for Bob

970
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,560
for all these years now.

971
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,720
It's the GWAR universe.

972
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,160
We will destroy you humans!

973
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,100
You all humans must

974
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,140
crawl beneath

975
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,420
great might of GWAR

976
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,800
and Bob as he comes to rip

977
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,600
your face off.

978
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,440
Actually, I think this show may feature such

979
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,940
scenes as Slymenstra

980
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,580
Hymen gets

981
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,760
impregnated by some, well,

982
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,740
these aliens, these aliens

983
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,400
abduct Odorous,

984
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,620
I think, and

985
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,200
they

986
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,920
extract some sperm

987
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,140
from Odorous Urungus

988
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,520
and it accidentally gets

989
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,120
Slymenstra Hymen

990
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,480
pregnant.

991
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,160
They crucify her

992
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,500
and give her an abortion

993
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,660
while she's being

994
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,020
crucified, but the baby

995
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,960
escapes and falls in

996
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,100
with the aliens, and then God

997
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,960
arrives, but it turns out God's

998
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,020
nothing but a big robot. Oh, I don't want to

999
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,580
give away the whole plot. Anyway,

1000
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,800
the way they put it to me

1001
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,980
over the phone, they go,

1002
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,640
the way our shows work

1003
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,580
is every

1004
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,040
three songs, no,

1005
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,760
we said, uh, every two songs

1006
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,040
we kill or rape somebody.

1007
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,600
Yeah, man,

1008
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,740
those guys, they have their own

1009
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,920
special version of slack, but you know

1010
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,060
their message is the same. It's a message

1011
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,120
of hate. It's just like

1012
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,980
the message of this church, a message of

1013
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,940
hate and, uh, and

1014
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,840
agony for our enemies

1015
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,220
and pure

1016
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,080
degeneracy and wallowing

1017
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
in slack for ourselves.

1018
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,740
Praise Bob. And

1019
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,040
I was gonna shut up and make this be,

1020
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,760
uh, a music show, because y'all have already heard

1021
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,600
me ranting enough. And what

1022
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
do we have coming up next here?

1023
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,040
Um,

1024
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,360
music by your fellow subgeniuses.

1025
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,060
Let's pull this little wellman

1026
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,700
head through here. This is, uh,

1027
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,500
Dr. Bizarro

1028
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,140
and the Disgustos.

1029
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,040
And here we go. This ought to be

1030
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,500
pertinent.

1031
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,560
This don't get us famous.

1032
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,720
Nothing will.

1033
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,600
Ha ha!

1034
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,720
Now people don't even

1035
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,140
know me. Cause I'm nobody

1036
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,120
now, you see.

1037
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,640
But what if people are gonna

1038
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,140
know me? Because my musical

1039
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,280
set ain't free.

1040
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,900
I'm gonna have a big house and

1041
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,080
two cars. I'll have more money

1042
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,120
than I can spend.

1043
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,560
Because I'm gonna be rich

1044
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
and famous, yes sir.

1045
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,060
And then I can buy some friends.

1046
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,540
And then I can buy some friends.

1047
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,060
And then I can buy some friends.

1048
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,980
Being famous really

1049
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,140
knocks me out. It's not so

1050
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
fun, you know.

1051
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,080
And rock, babe, we'll make it

1052
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,840
to the top. If we ever

1053
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,080
do the rock and roll.

1054
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,460
Yeah, baby,

1055
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,100
that's the way.

1056
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,980
You've got to make

1057
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,840
the rock and roll.

1058
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,540
You've got to make the rock and roll.

1059
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,200
That's right.

1060
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,080
That's so cool.

1061
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,660
I think I'm gonna choke on

1062
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,360
the old vomit.

1063
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,120
I'll be so famous.

1064
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,920
I'll have so much cash.

1065
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,220
Famous.

1066
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,920
I can buy me some stash.

1067
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,720
Famous. I can buy me a car.

1068
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,080
I'll be so famous.

1069
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,540
It'll be so bizarre.

1070
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,720
I'll be so famous.

1071
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:48,420
I'll be so famous.

1072
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,040
I'll be so famous.

1073
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:38,980
I'll be so famous.

1074
00:42:48,540 --> 00:43:13,040
I'll be so famous.

1075
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:28,220
I'll be so famous.

1076
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,620
I'll be so famous.

1077
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,120
I'll make America

1078
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


1079
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


1080
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


1081
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


1082
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,160


1083
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,640
I'll be so famous.

1084
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,100
I'll be so famous.

1085
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,580
I'll be so famous.

1086
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,380
I'll be so famous.

1087
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,140
I'll be so famous.

1088
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,400
I'll be so famous.

1089
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,620
I'll be so famous.

1090
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,300
I'll be so famous.

1091
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,080
I'll be so famous.

1092
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,780
I'll be so famous.

1093
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,100
And play it for myself

1094
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,040
And no one else

1095
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,740
No more freebies

1096
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,380
And if I can't pay my bills

1097
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,020
I'll know it was the will of the people

1098
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,580
It's not that I haven't tried

1099
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,400
But there's a limit to my patience

1100
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,260
Bet your ass

1101
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,840
You'll spend your money on bullshit

1102
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,940
Reward the media for years

1103
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,820
Who are just in it for the bucks

1104
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,020
A pack of opportunists

1105
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,180
Who get stronger as they make you weak

1106
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,760
They lie to you when you believe it

1107
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,020
Just like they calculate you to

1108
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,900
Their music is all the same

1109
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,780
They can barely write their own name

1110
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,880
By supporting them

1111
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,160
What does that make you?

1112
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,820
By giving money to the strangers

1113
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,640
While neglecting the needs of your own

1114
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:17,920
People who are just in it for the bucks

1115
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,160
Harvest what you can and what remains

1116
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,960
Because tomorrow you'll be empty and alone

1117
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,600
I feel like I'm doing this for nothing

1118
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,500
Don't have a house, can't pay the rent

1119
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,000
While you go to shows by those who didn't give a shit

1120
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,280
The whole affair's an embarrassment

1121
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,100
You'll spend your money on bullshit

1122
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,120
Reward the media for years

1123
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,920
Who are just in it for the bucks

1124
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,220
A pack of opportunists

1125
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,740
Who get stronger as they make you weak

1126
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,980
They lie to you when you believe it

1127
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,080
Just like they calculate you to

1128
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,060
Their music is all the same

1129
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,960
They can barely write their own name

1130
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,080
By supporting them

1131
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,440
What does that make you?

1132
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,720
By supporting them

1133
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,680
What doesn't matter who they are

1134
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,200
Why did those people him?

1135
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,300
They see that they saw fire

1136
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,800
And note when they know

1137
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,320
How to turn their minds

1138
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,320


1139
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,780
About the ones they have

1140
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,200
Of

1141
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,680
The

1142
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,940
Big

1143
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,040
Canal

1144
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,920
.por

1145
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:47,920


1146
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,360
Whoa.

1147
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:03,400
Whoa.

1148
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,260
Oh, friends.

1149
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,580
Zug's Rift.

1150
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,180
The brilliant musician, composer Zug's Rift.

1151
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,760
Off of a special tape.

1152
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,160
It's promo pack tape.

1153
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,780
And, oh, man.

1154
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,080
I'm going to have written down on my table here.

1155
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,980
I've written down four numbers.

1156
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,040
They're footage numbers.

1157
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,280
Where I'm going to have to go back through that tape.

1158
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,200
Hold it.

1159
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,420
I'm not going to distort Zug's thing here.

1160
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,860
I have to go back through these four footage notations here on the tape.

1161
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,700
And put a blank spot where there were curse words.

1162
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,900
Curse words that you can tell by the rhyme what they are.

1163
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:08,760
And I know perfectly well how irritating it is to hear those blanks.

1164
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,080
Right in the middle of so many subgenius rants and songs and so forth.

1165
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,440
And, well.

1166
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:24,180
We want to draw attention to the fact that there seem to be these superstitious people who control the entire country.

1167
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,720
Who feel like words.

1168
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,440
Words, friends.

1169
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,240
Are somehow.

1170
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,960
You know.

1171
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,620
They're going to mess somebody up.

1172
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,120
They're going to do some terrible damage.

1173
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,560
Now, primetime TV.

1174
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,320
They're not worried about that at all.

1175
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,580
There's big money there.

1176
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,580
But, and you know the thing is.

1177
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,300
On a normal rock and roll station.

1178
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,020
They say all sorts of bad words.

1179
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:51,900
Some say.

1180
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,140
You know.

1181
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,860
My kids say.

1182
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,860
Well the cool stations.

1183
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,720
You know.

1184
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
Leave the words in.

1185
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,560
And the uncool stations cut them out.

1186
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:57,760
Well.

1187
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,060
All of those stations have lawyers on retainer.

1188
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,800
The stations that play this show.

1189
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,520
Don't.

1190
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,460
And the conspiracy can give them a small fine.

1191
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,100
That can shut them down for good.

1192
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,660
So.

1193
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,060
Rather than just avoid those confrontational songs.

1194
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,560
That have a lot of cussing in them.

1195
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,840
Because they're honest songs.

1196
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,500
We go ahead and play them.

1197
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,020
But we hurt them.

1198
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,660
We make it very plain that we've had to do that.

1199
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,480
And that's just the.

1200
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,680
That's sort of the policy around here.

1201
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,260
That way we can hand this subversive stuff out to anybody.

1202
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,460
And it's brother.

1203
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,940
And say.

1204
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,900
Oh no.

1205
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,300
This is perfectly alright.

1206
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:40,860
Because.

1207
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,300
It doesn't have those.

1208
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,680
Four letter words in it.

1209
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,640
So you're safe now.

1210
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,940
You know.

1211
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,780
Jesus won't be mad at you for having this in the house.

1212
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,320
For your kid having this in the house.

1213
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,660
Because you know.

1214
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,360
It doesn't have those bad words.

1215
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:56,920
Oh.

1216
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,740
And bad ideas.

1217
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,260
Bad.

1218
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,760
Bad ideas friends.

1219
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,260
Are so.

1220
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,300
So much more subversive aren't they.

1221
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,920
Anyway.

1222
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,460
Zug's Rift.

1223
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,860
As you can tell by.

1224
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,940
The level of intensity in that song.

1225
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,840
You won't be surprised to know that he just recently retired from the music business.

1226
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,600
Gave up.

1227
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,600
He's sick and tired of dubbing tapes for six bucks each.

1228
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,880
I know exactly how he feels.

1229
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,720
He's gone off to join that community hidden in Colorado in the mountains.

1230
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,660
Where all the geniuses go when they feel like it's time to just tell the normals.

1231
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:36,920
Man.

1232
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,600
I'm gone.

1233
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,060
And it serves you right.

1234
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,200
And I've.

1235
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:42,560
I've.

1236
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,500
I've thought about that friends.

1237
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,640
But I'm a sub genius.

1238
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,860
They won't let me in.

1239
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,100
My plane would probably crash trying to find that thing.

1240
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,280
But I can give you the number for Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.

1241
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,860
Which I did last week I think.

1242
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,380
They're at IBOB Digital.

1243
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,740
And that's P.O.

1244
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,140
Box 3405.

1245
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,520
IBOB.

1246
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,180
P.O.

1247
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,720
Box 3405.

1248
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,200
Skokie, Illinois.

1249
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,540
610.

1250
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:12,540


1251
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:12,540


1252
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:12,540


1253
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,260
6-0-0-7-6.

1254
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,820
Box 3405.

1255
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,520
Skokie.

1256
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,280
6-00-7-6 friends.

1257
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,540
And so they're, well they're, they're a habit.

1258
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,060
Now I'm going to have to go through and cut all that stuff out.

1259
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,560
And you've already heard how it sounds.

1260
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,720
It's awful ain't it.

1261
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,060
Praise in the Night will return following station identification.

1262
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,180
Mmm goodnight.

1263
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,580
Pete.

1264
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,600
Hey.

1265
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,340
Back, back injury.

1266
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:42,520
Back injury.

1267
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,820
Yes sir.

1268
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,380
How long you been suffering with that?

1269
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,780
About a week.

1270
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,360
Had about a week ago on the job.

1271
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,940
I work in a warehouse.

1272
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,780
Mmm hmm.

1273
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,260
But I'm believing God.

1274
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
I'm believing God.

1275
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,280
Tonight.

1276
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,060
I just like that, that woman before the last one.

1277
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,520
Yeah.

1278
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,860
I have a testimony, I have a praise report a lot like hers.

1279
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,720
I, I tell you I was, I made an idol out of them psychiatrists.

1280
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,320
Like that you know.

1281
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,400
Mmm hmm.

1282
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,620
And I had folks telling me, you know, you gotta keep going.

1283
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,340
Mmm hmm.

1284
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,520
And I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I

1285
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,120
was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

1286
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,220
I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I

1287
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,220


1288
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,840
I was making practices and I was.

1289
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,340
You should never tick coding, orみprior gather up.

1290
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,000
And take an identifencia.

1291
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,540
Myself, I didn't give a shit, I was working for somebody else.

1292
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,500
I had been working and I was better than, and just working.

1293
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,500


1294
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,400
me a lot of money, too. I'm telling you, stand

1295
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,280
up. Your back's gonna get ready to get healed right now. You ready?

1296
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,220
You standing? Uh,

1297
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,520
yeah. Watch it. Shake!

1298
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,420
I believe something's happening.

1299
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,420
Hey, hey.

1300
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,820
I am waiting for you.

1301
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,040
Oh, Lord.

1302
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,840
I am waiting

1303
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,500
for you.

1304
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,580
I can't touch my toes.

1305
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,440
I can't.

1306
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,200
I don't know if you can hear this, but I'm

1307
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,260
leaning over, touching my toes.

1308
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,340
Ow!

1309
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,420
Ow! Hey!

1310
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,680
I think you bugged me up, Steve.

1311
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,140
This guy's at the church.

1312
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,320
I'll tell you something.

1313
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,280
Thank you, Lord,

1314
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:41,820
for your time.

1315
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,340
Thank you, Lord.

1316
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,420
Thank you, Lord.

1317
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,340
Thank you, Lord.

1318
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:43,340


1319
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,400
It's a serious thing to

1320
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,200
be involved in. This is not a game.

1321
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,620
It's not a show.

1322
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
This is kingdom of God business.

1323
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,620
Well, I used to be

1324
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,660
a sinner because I truly

1325
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,600
did believe that

1326
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,200
the Virgin married Jesus

1327
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,640
and me were thick as thieves.

1328
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,760
And I used to give my dough to televangelistic snobs

1329
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,520
Then the light had shone upon me and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs

1330
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,200
Now my wallet belongs to Bob

1331
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,400
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

1332
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,180
Well, my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job

1333
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,420
But my wallet belongs to Bob

1334
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:53,120
Well, Bobby goes a-fropping every chance that he can get

1335
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,880
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat

1336
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,820
So I gave him all my money, Reverend Stang said it was right

1337
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,560
And for only $20 he did save my soul tonight

1338
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,460
And so my wallet belongs to Bob

1339
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,400
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

1340
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,360
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob

1341
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,160
Cause my wallet belongs to Bob

1342
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,360
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie and Connie is her name

1343
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,820
And her ways could put the sake of it all on the table

1344
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,300
And she's the secret whore of Babylon to shame

1345
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,180
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard

1346
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,920
And pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card

1347
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,920
So my wallet belongs to Bob

1348
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,680
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

1349
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,600
And I never have to fear cause I know Connie's on the job

1350
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,820
Cause my wallet belongs to Bob

1351
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,940
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

1352
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,980
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

1353
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:25,500
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too

1354
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,320
Their existential energy may be what's right for you

1355
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,560
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults

1356
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,840
And give away your money to the one that gets results

1357
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,800
And then your wallet will be gone

1358
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:41,800


1359
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,860
Cause your wallet will be for Bob

1360
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,940
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob

1361
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,820
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob

1362
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:59,080
Cause your wallet will be for Bob

1363
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,680
Well, I believe I am much calmer

1364
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,480
Got the bleeding head of Arnold

1365
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,700
And the power of Palmer

1366
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,020
Sitting on the dashboard of my car

1367
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,260
Praise Bob!

1368
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,260
Praise Bob!

1369
00:58:41,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1370
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:41,820


1371
00:59:41,820 --> 01:00:11,820


1372
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:41,820


1373
01:00:41,820 --> 01:01:11,820


1374
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:41,820


1375
01:01:41,820 --> 01:02:11,820


1376
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:41,820


1377
01:02:41,820 --> 01:03:11,820


1378
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:40,560
