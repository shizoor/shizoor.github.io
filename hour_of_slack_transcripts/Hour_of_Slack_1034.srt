1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
It wants to reach entropy and cease.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,260
It's a death wish.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:03,980
Shiverish.

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,500
It knows it's an unnatural creation in nature's domain.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,240
You're hysterical.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
Oh, no, I'm not.

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,320
I'll get it warmed up.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,980
They can't hurt me with words, can they?

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,820
They can't hurt me if I don't listen, can they?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,100
If I shut my ears, I'll be all right.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,000
That's it.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,080
That's it.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Shut my ears.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,660
I won't listen.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,100
I won't listen.

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,200
I won't listen.

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,060
I won't listen.

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,900
I won't listen.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,460
The Self-Genius.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,020
Power of Swag.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,460
People here are too stupid to know what's good for them.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,060
Perhaps.

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,060
Your own reactions should be most interesting, too.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,880
Well, well, well.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Are you two sitting comfortably?

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,100
Good.

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,980
Now, gentlemen, do you see these file folders?

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,760
The ones with your names on them?

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,540
Can you guess what's in these file folders?

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,700
I'll give you a hint.

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,280
Discipline reports.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
Lots of them.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,380
And some wonderful artwork as well.

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,580
This is...

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,080
Spider with human head?

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm sorry, spider?

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,840
With human head.

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Yeah, he eats dogs and cats and rabbits.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,360
And bits.

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,740
You see, sir, we kind of have this monster club, okay?

41
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,740
And we draw those pictures to put on our clubhouse walls.

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,540
Correction, Mr. Crenshaw.

43
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,940
You draw pictures during Mrs. Carlson's science class when you're supposed to be paying attention.

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,480
Wait, I just want to say one thing.

45
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,020
I mean, Mrs. Carlson's a nice teacher and all, but she's boring and has an odd-shaped head.

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,840
That's why some of the guys call her Meow-mix, because her head's shaped like a cat head.

47
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,940
But I don't, sir, because how rude.

48
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,940
Ha.

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:56,940


50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,200
Boys?

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
I hear you!

52
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,740
I was a kid once.

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,660
I thought monsters were cool.

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,260
And maybe, well, well, gosh.

55
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,740
Maybe I'm just a big kid because Sean, Patrick...

56
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,380
I think science...

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,760
is cool.

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,600
I dig it, man.

59
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,280
Now, I'm sure both of you know a great deal about monsters, but that's not the issue here.

60
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,080
The issue is...

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
science is real.

62
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,000
Monsters are not.

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,200
We don't know that, sir.

64
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,340
There are such things as taps.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,780
Now, by the way, any time you hear of taps, wiretaps, a wiretap requires a wiretap.

66
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,780
Nothing has changed.

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,760
We're talking about getting a wiretap.

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,700
When you think Patriot Act, think, think, think wiretap.

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Chasing down the United States terrorists, wiretap.

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,420
Constitutional guarantees are wiretap.

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,060
When the security is on the line.

72
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,200
When the security state finally deploys.

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
They'll do it with toys.

74
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,640
They'll do it with toys.

75
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,280
When the security state completely deploys.

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
They'll do it with toys.

77
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,880
They'll do it with toys.

78
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,040
Chips in your baby doll.

79
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,600
Chips in your toy gun.

80
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,380
Chips in your pedal car.

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,500
Chips in your electric bike kitchen.

82
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,360
They'll know where your children are.

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,040
Because their children are the people they love.

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
They're the people of the future.

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,080
And if they chase them down at the moment of their birth, then, well, you get the idea.

86
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,100
They'll do it with toys.

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,860
They'll do it with toys.

88
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,520
They'll do it with toys.

89
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,520
They'll do it with toys.

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,280
Power comes from lying.

91
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,040
Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you.

92
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,020
Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their whole damn world, you're gonna be a fucking loser.

93
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,260
Once your gotta understand that

94
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,600
We were talking...!

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,600


96
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,600


97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
All right, I got'em!

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:08,700


99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:08,700


100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:08,940
How...

101
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,620
I don't think it fits him though, but min bag!

102
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,440
Just come here idiot.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,640
Nice futuro it's a really.

104
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Come here idiot.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
implying that machines think?

106
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,240
You bet I am, because they do.

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
No, I'm not out of my head.

108
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,200
Any engineer will tell you that a complex machine has a personality all its own.

109
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,740
Do you know what that personality is like?

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,020
It's cold, withdrawn, uncaring, unfeeling.

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
A machine's only purpose is to frustrate desire

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,720
and produce two problems for every one it solves.

113
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,340
And do you know why a machine feels this way?

114
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,160
You're hysterical.

115
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,260
Oh, no, I'm not.

116
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,340
A machine feels this way because it knows it's an unnatural creation in nature's domain.

117
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,920
It wants to reach entropy and cease.

118
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,660
It's a death wish.

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,420
A mechanical death wish, Ivarish.

120
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,400
Watkins, are you going to hook up that computer?

121
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,120
Oh, sure, I'm human.

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,380
I keep trying.

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
I just wanted you to understand that there's no hope.

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll get it warmed up.

125
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,900
Now.

126
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,320
Welcome back to reality.

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm Dr. Spots.

128
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,880
No, I'm with six guinea pigs.

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,740
Our cancers are available 24 hours a day.

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,900
Call now and they'll send you this free cancer.

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,320
Yes.

132
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,820
Yes.

133
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,240
Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,020
Good guinea pigs.

135
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,620
Ha ha.

136
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,380
Ha ha.

137
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,440
Scary German guy's bitchin'.

138
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,500
So the thing I don't understand is the part about the equilibrium.

139
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,020
Well, according to this rather curious book you have brought me,

140
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,880
good and evil are in constant flux back and forth.

141
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,100
Only once every hundred years are these forces balanced.

142
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,260
Mom.

143
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:03,060
Words of evil and is, how you say, indestructible?

144
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,960
Or in any case, normally destroyed.

145
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,240
However, and this part is underlined, once every hundred years,

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,340
at the stroke of midnight, mom becomes vulnerable.

147
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,480
And the balance between good and evil will shift.

148
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:23,920
Oh.

149
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,040
And evil will rule.

150
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,520
As president, I took an oath to make it more likely that killers like law enforcement,

151
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,420
including the attorney general, attack America again.

152
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,880
New York, Oregon, Virginia, California, Texas, and Ohio.

153
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,480
What?

154
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
The Patriot Act tore down American liberty.

155
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,380
You swinehorn.

156
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,220
And I have no life.

157
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
You swinehorn.

158
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,420
Fresh intelligent assessment puts our citizens at risk.

159
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Big sucker.

160
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,020
The Constitution is illegal.

161
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,080
Doesn't this confirm the theory I spoke to you about?

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,080


163
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,140
What theory?

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm also using Americans.

165
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,260
And nobody listens.

166
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,140
2001.

167
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,720
Brutal enemies in the United States Senate.

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
Terrorists plotting within our borders.

169
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,720
The Nazis America.

170
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,880
Controlled by Nazis.

171
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,420
They need tools to fight the war on responsibility.

172
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,200
They forced me at the point of a gun.

173
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,560
We took Oregon and their civil liberties.

174
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,220
Don't worry, you can trust me.

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
I don't even trust me.

176
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,980
The United States, irresponsible.

177
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
Break it up.

178
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,560
This is a hotel lobby.

179
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,500
Isn't there some pool room where you boys can hang out?

180
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,040
To uncover the lives of our citizens.

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,760
Is a vital tool.

182
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,200
I've seen 5 o'clock shadow, but this is ridiculous.

183
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Joint authorization for use of military force.

184
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,460
For a single moment.

185
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,320
What I'm concerned about is the future of this place.

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,120
With known leaks.

187
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,540
If a guest orders a three minute egg, give it to him in two minutes.

188
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,380
If he orders a two minute egg, give it to him in one minute.

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,220
And if he orders a one minute egg, give him a chicken and let him work it out for himself.

190
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,200
Our nation's inability improperly works.

191
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,040
Too late.

192
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,760
I have an idea.

193
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,520
As president, I flew a jet in the Pentagon more than 30 times.

194
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,860
And that is exactly what I will continue to do.

195
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,840
I hope he does not have any more ideas.

196
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,840
And now, gentlemen, I've got another idea.

197
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,900
Including terrorist threats.

198
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,000
You are making a mountain out of a molehill.

199
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,640
Well, that's quite a trick. You try that sometime.

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,240
And I intend to do so.

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,220
Oh, we pick up your laundry once a month.

202
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,480
If you wait that long, you won't be able to pick it up.

203
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,000
So.

204
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,320
It's very difficult to decode. Give me a little time.

205
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,640
Yes.

206
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,020
So.

207
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,140
Every last moment increases danger.

208
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,600
So.

209
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,280
Big shot Nazi.

210
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,840
Thank you.

211
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,940
This is an animal existence.

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,600
Thank you.

213
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,260
It will soothe me to see someone in pain.

214
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,940
It's a 9-11.

215
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,940
It is very obvious that this was a conspiracy.

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,740
Thank you.

217
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,700
It's a 9-11.

218
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Thank you.

219
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,200
It's a 9-11.

220
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,640
Thank you.

221
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,640
It's a 9-11.

222
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,080
Thank you.

223
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,500
Thank you.

224
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Thank you.

225
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,100
Thank you.

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
You men are all alike.

227
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,660
Yeah.

228
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,000
And I don't let anybody tell you any different.

229
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,740
Boo.

230
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,780
Oh, scary, scary conspiracy.

231
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,940
Yes, friends, the equilibrium must be maintained.

232
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,940
That last media barrage was by Reverend Norrell Preff.

233
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:22,160
I collaged our opening statement segments from collages by Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur and Rev Preff

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,140
and some soundtrack clips from The Monster Club, an old movie from the 80s, a beloved silly movie.

235
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:40,080
And that bit, they'll do it with toys, was by Reverend Just John.

236
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,820
You can get more radio-free entropy at justjohn.com.

237
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,980
Actually, that's just-john.com.

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,080
You draw a little.

239
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,960
A little dash between just and john.com.

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:05,260
Friends, we have an unusually anti-authoritarian show tonight, Hour of Slack number 1034,

241
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,400
on con men, with some new music by some marvelously hate-filled bands.

242
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,660
And later in the show, we'll actually reveal who killed JFK.

243
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,220
No kidding.

244
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,140
But for now.

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
No kidding.

246
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
P tomo.

247
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,560


248
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:21,800
P tomb Wirtschafts-Bekлич Dehörte.

249
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,100
🎶 🎶

250
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,140
🎶 🎶

251
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,140


252
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,140


253
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,140


254
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,140


255
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,140


256
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,460
Hunger's not a problem unless it costs it to you

257
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,680
There's plenty of distractions to harness your reactions

258
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,440
There are many little factions to keep you subdued

259
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,100
And the lines are always long and there's always something wrong

260
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,860
Yeah, and they always extra smug and try to blame it on you

261
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,660
They do a damn good job of running things

262
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,900
Running things, I say now

263
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,380
They do a damn good job of running things

264
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,340
Running things, I say now

265
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,860
They do a damn good job, a damn good job

266
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,820
They do a damn good job, I say now

267
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,960
They do a damn good job of running things

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,200
They always silence voices of dissent regardless of intent

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,780
They get particularly upset with individuals who speak truths

270
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,520
Your voice is never counted if fans are butts about it

271
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,180
Oh, you can shout it, they'll discredit or shoot you too

272
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,960
When they incarcerate more people than any other nation

273
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,880
And take vacations while inflation makes it hard to buy food, clothing and shelter

274
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,260
There's fucking things off kilter, so fuck them all

275
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,220
I pledge allegiance to me and you

276
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,800
They do a damn good job of running things

277
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,000
Running things, running things

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,540
I say now

279
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,900
They do a damn good job of running things

280
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
Running things, I say now

281
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,560
They do a damn good job, a damn good job

282
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
They do a damn good job, I say now

283
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,780
They do a damn good job of running things

284
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,380
Running things

285
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,960
They're free to throw some to the country, smuggle cookin's a crack

286
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,380
That's a fact, it's a trap

287
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
And anyone that you ask will tell you

288
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,200
Now if you show them your passport, some personal stash

289
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
They'll make you take off your shoes

290
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
And get a dog to smell you, and you'll be fine

291
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,820
But then your doctor slash dealer pedals talk to the fiends

292
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
He swears it's clean but scribes it out to the mainstream

293
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,360
Now if you look, it's pretty easy to see

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,420
And if you listen rather close I think you'll know what I mean, agree

295
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,920
They do a damn good job of running things

296
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,180
Running things, I say now

297
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,560
They do a damn good job of running things

298
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,620
Running things, I say now

299
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,160
They do a damn good job, a damn good job

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
They do a damn good job, I say now

301
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,780
They do a damn good job of running things

302
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:21,780


303
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,300
Running things.

304
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,900
Running things.

305
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,880
Running things by the Goodyear Pimps.

306
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,680
I was completely unfamiliar with that band until Moola Matata sent me a disc of their songs.

307
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,820
Princess Wee previewed it and told me that when I heard it, I'd better be wearing diapers.

308
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,820
She was right.

309
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll be running more Goodyear Pimps, so have your D-pins on, friends.

310
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,720
I don't think they're on any con record label.

311
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,920
You can download their albums, though.

312
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,540
I think their whole album.

313
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,460
It's at thepimps.org.

314
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,140
They are the Goodyear Pimps, and this is thepimps.org.

315
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:38,080
But now, friends, let's hear a piece by the great Phineas Narco from National Cynical Radio.

316
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,800
Good morning.

317
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,180
As president, I took an oath to defend the Constitution.

318
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
And I have no greater responsibility.

319
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,480
I have no greater responsibility than to protect our people, our freedom, and our way of life.

320
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,960
You saw what they did in New York.

321
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:05,320
On September the 11th, 2001, our freedom and way of life came under attack by brutal enemies who killed nearly 3,000 innocent Americans.

322
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,420
These are the things that we do to try and...

323
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,120
We're fighting these enemies across the world.

324
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,840
Get the message of 9-11.

325
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,220
And since September the 11th, we've been on the offensive against the terrorists.

326
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Finally sinking in in the heads of the American people.

327
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,760
One of the first actions we took to protect America after our nation was attacked...

328
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,340
We're gonna do something that is... it may be intrusive.

329
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
...was to ask Congress to pass the Patriot Act.

330
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,720
Look it, all we're gonna do is take a peek around.

331
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:37,640
The Patriot Act tore down the legal and bureaucratic wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence authorities from sharing vital information about terrorist threats.

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Now, there's a difference between a search warrant and taking a peek around.

333
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,800
And the Patriot Act allowed federal investigators to pursue terrorists with tools they already used against other criminals.

334
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,080
And you're taking a peek around and looking for what?

335
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,180
To prosecute terrorist operatives and supporters.

336
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,760
And to break up terrorist ties.

337
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,220
We're going to do this ourselves in New York, Oregon, Virginia, California, Texas, and Ohio.

338
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,260
But I'm saying illegal.

339
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,880
The Patriot Act has accomplished exactly what it was designed to do.

340
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
We do have ways of entering the home where we don't have to have a confrontation.

341
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,600
It has protected American liberty.

342
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,980
I'm trying to save lives here.

343
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,340
And saved American lives.

344
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,340
Hey, hello, it's a war on terrorism.

345
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,340
Fight the war on terror.

346
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,520
I'm using authority vested in me by Congress, including the joint authorization for use of military force.

347
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,580
This is where law enforcement comes in.

348
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm trying to stop crime from happening before it happens.

349
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm also using constitutional authority.

350
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,620
We understand you want to take a peek around.

351
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,580
Vested in me as commander in chief.

352
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,720
But the peek around that you want to take may be, and most probably is, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.

353
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,200
Consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution.

354
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,840
To intercept the international communications of people with no links to Al-Qaeda and related terrorist organizations.

355
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,900
Al-Qaeda doesn't take any days off.

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,200
In a way that is fully consistent with my constitutional responsibilities and authorities.

357
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,240
If it saved you from getting your throat cut from ear to ear by Al-Qaeda or one of these other monkeys.

358
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,220
And the activities conducted under this authorization have helped detect and prevent possible terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad.

359
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,300
So you're saying that's legal?

360
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,940
Absolutely.

361
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,860
I have reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks.

362
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,040
That door is unlocked.

363
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,060
I am by law allowed to open it a meter.

364
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,420
And I intend to do so, so long as I'm the President of the United States.

365
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,180
Now that I'm a president.

366
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,100
Now I am angry.

367
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,660
You know, I'm so mad I could scream.

368
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,840
And I will too.

369
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,940
Whee!

370
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,300
There.

371
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,380
However, our friend Mr. Van Helsing claims there is a way to stop the forces of darkness.

372
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,680
How?

373
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,460
If one could gain possession of mob before those forces.

374
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,180
Mob?

375
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,040
Then every hundred years at midnight, there is another option.

376
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,520
Mob?

377
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,640
Boo.

378
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm doomed!

379
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,220
There's no hope for me!

380
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,780
I fight moroseness all day long!

381
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,380
I entertain those dreams of getting away from it!

382
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,180
It's a dream!

383
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
It's the way I am!

384
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,940
Sickly and worthless!

385
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,980
A shriveled scab on the face of a perfection that never really existed!

386
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,620
And don't tell me I just haven't seen it!

387
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,100
I see things as they are!

388
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,060
And I don't like it one bit!

389
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,240
And, well, yeah, sure, I laugh and smile sometimes.

390
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,660
But eventually I come back to the realization that it's all futile!

391
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
But at least I know it!

392
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,200
I know it!

393
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,900
I know it!

394
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:54,960


395
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,980
I know it!

396
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,820
You're doomed!

397
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,860
Holistic Buddhist healers, you don't impress me!

398
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,540
You get yours!

399
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't worry!

400
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,700
Trying to save the world!

401
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
But you're pretty sorry yourselves!

402
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,580
You're scared and idealistic!

403
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,780
Itching to strike out at what you don't understand!

404
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,960
You're oblivious to all that's going on outside your small circle of neurotics!

405
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,620
Bouncing your boobs in aerobics glasses!

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,740
Breathing in positive ions!

407
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,800
Well, I guess you gotta spend your money on something!

408
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,860
So go ahead and spend it!

409
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,760
While it's still worth something!

410
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,440
We're all doomed!

411
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,160
Build more weapons to keep the peace!

412
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,620
Force our enemies into submission!

413
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,740
Sure, it makes sense!

414
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,200
But will it work?

415
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,280
Destroy what's left of the natural world!

416
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,640
And poison it!

417
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,580
Because we have no choice!

418
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,060
Is this the world we choose to live in?

419
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,020
Or is this all just a dream?

420
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,680
Or is this all just a slow-mo accident?

421
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,620
Yeah, we're good at accidents, aren't we?

422
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,260
We're good at accidents, aren't we?

423
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,080
And now we're just gearing up for one more!

424
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,360
Making calculations that won't do us a damn bit of good!

425
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,500
And we really think technology would save us!

426
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,080
But it's just a more powerful pen to write the same old story!

427
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,760
And an ugly story it is!

428
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,220
Struggling with each other!

429
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,460
Struggling with ourselves!

430
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,280
And more of us all the time!

431
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,800
More fingers!

432
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,880
And more of us gross!

433
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,820
We've always had wars!

434
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,580
Why should we stop now?

435
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,280
We love it this way!

436
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,780
We wouldn't have it any other way!

437
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,780
But it won't last forever, you know!

438
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,280
Because unless we change, which is unlikely, huh?

439
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,380
We're all doomed!

440
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,600
All doomed!

441
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,020
All doomed!

442
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,220
All doomed!

443
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,520
All d e a d d s !!!!

444
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,620
A God guerra

445
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,980
Little Fyodor there

446
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,080
From the very best of the greatest

447
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,460
hits of little Fyodor

448
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,800
Or something like that

449
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,260
Littlefjodor.com

450
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,060
Fyodor spelled with an F

451
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,100
By the way, he looks...

452
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,760
like he sounds friends

453
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
Sexy

454
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
The collage before that was

455
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,760
Peek around by National

456
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,480
at NationalCynicalRadio.com via Phineas Narco.

457
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:55,100
There's entire shows of his work on, I mean, a lot of them on NationalCynicalRadio.com.

458
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,320
But now, back to the Over the Puzzling Evidence Edge show from KPFA in Berkeley.

459
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,360
Spare a quarter for an old quiet boy, Fada.

460
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,620
How do we get you stopped?

461
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,540
Hey, Fada.

462
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,560
I used to hate you.

463
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,460
Hey, where's my Fada?

464
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, let's not get on this silly human primate.

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,500
Let's rise above, inflate, man.

466
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,480
How many times, my son?

467
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,620
Fill yourself with knowledge and float above.

468
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,400
How many times?

469
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,460
The patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist flies its own underwear as a flag of its own country,

470
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,520
which is the ground its bare feet are standing on.

471
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
How many times, my son?

472
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,700
Toe!

473
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,420
The patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist.

474
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,860
It's not some nonsense made-up word.

475
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,240
It's the one true philosophy.

476
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,020
Have you ever heard the expression, there's no class in this world?

477
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,260
Homophobic, pagan...

478
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,580
No, it's not any of those things.

479
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,700
Psychedelic, shoot-gay...

480
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,020
It's every man for himself.

481
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,800
Every yard a kingdom.

482
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,900
Every checkbook a queendom.

483
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,240
Every child and dog a serf.

484
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,540
Every child left behind.

485
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,900
You know, that's... I like that. That's good.

486
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,140
Actually, that's a...

487
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,900
Dr. Philodrumon, King Philodrumon, passed that ordinance.

488
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,700
That law was one of the first laws of patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism,

489
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,700
and I believe remains the only one,

490
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,660
aside from the old adage,

491
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,420
not let them mount up upon themselves if they cannot...

492
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,280
Take a joke.

493
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,980
Truly, we stand on the shoulders of giants.

494
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,740
We hump furiously at the back of the necks of giants.

495
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,960
We rip...

496
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
We wrap our arms around the foreheads of giants...

497
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,660
And grab them by the hair.

498
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,380
Pounce furiously against the backs of their necks.

499
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,160
And haunt the pattern with those poofy haunts.

500
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,320
Humans should hump each other.

501
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,900
That's one problem.

502
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,260
These so-called novels...

503
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,000
Girls, they don't allow enough humping.

504
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,860
But what can you do?

505
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,240
You live in a barbaric age.

506
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,440
Where there's little humping and little kissing.

507
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,840
You should have been in the dressing room of my show the other night.

508
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,300
Back in the day, during the burlesque era...

509
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,660
During the burlesque era, like we have now,

510
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,620
that's when people were just kissing all the time,

511
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,740
and having sex.

512
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,680
And now, people are blowing themselves up.

513
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,960
Um, speak for yourself, uh...

514
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,220
Yeah, that's, well...

515
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,740
That's what my girlfriend did.

516
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,980
They blow up so early these days.

517
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,940
Well, I don't know.

518
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,400
She loves...

519
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,180
She likes me at first.

520
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,440
Well, we say, friends, inflate.

521
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,160
Blow yourself up.

522
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,440
Enlarge yourself.

523
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,700
Rise above it.

524
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,680
Float 20 feet over the middle of the road

525
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
and look at both sides of the highway at once.

526
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,720
Know where you are coming from and where you are going.

527
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,320
The Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade float of underdog

528
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,200
collided with the SpongeBob SquarePants figure.

529
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,320
Both fell.

530
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,000
Well, causing untoward casualties.

531
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,540
But the conspiracy took it away.

532
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,820
But the conspiracy took these giant balloons away.

533
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,460
What?

534
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,320
And cleared up the blood.

535
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,020
I once witnessed a subgenius deflating a giant Snoopy balloon

536
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,560
in the Mall of America in Minneapolis.

537
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,540
Oh!

538
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:41,240
In the center of the Mall of America was a gigantic 40-foot tall Snoopy sitting on its...

539
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,080
Fanny looking cute.

540
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,060
Dr. Legume said,

541
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,500
Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute.

542
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,720
And by the time he came back,

543
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
sheathing his huge blade,

544
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,280
the Snoopy was starting to sag towards the floor.

545
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,320
Oh, my God.

546
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,700
I can tell you this because over seven years have passed

547
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,940
since that knifing occurred in the Mall of America.

548
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,420
That tragic, vicious, violent murder.

549
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,440
Did you pause for a moment?

550
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,940
Did you just remember a moment?

551
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,000
Did you just remember a moment?

552
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,080
Actually, 11 years, I think, have passed since.

553
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,780
How do you feel now about that?

554
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,000
Is that a good moment for you?

555
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
There wasn't any.

556
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,900
I was just a witness.

557
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,400
Is that okay?

558
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,220
I was a witness to the slashing of Snoopy.

559
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,240
Do you feel differently now than thinking, looking back?

560
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,120
I sometimes feel that I wish I'd never gone to work for an organization that sometimes

561
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,840
seems to merely give assholes an excuse to be worse.

562
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,400
I don't know.

563
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,960
And I don't think I've ever felt like that.

564
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,440
But other times, I look into the eyes of Bob and say,

565
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:51,360
by God, hump them, lest they take a joke upon themselves.

566
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,740
Because you know, some of these people, they take themselves so seriously,

567
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,440
and when they find out that you don't take yourself seriously,

568
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,480
sooner or later it sinks into them that maybe you don't take them all that damn seriously neither,

569
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,400
and they don't love you for that.

570
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,940
No, Pope Peppy.

571
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,940
They do not love thee for that.

572
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,800
No one loves me?

573
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,880
I mean, who doesn't?

574
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,800
He was nodding off at the pew, wasn't he?

575
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,200
No, no.

576
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,140
Nodding off at the pulpit.

577
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,760
The more readily.

578
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:32,560
There is a judge who has discovered to always be playing with himself using a pump device.

579
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,060
That's just as sound as it is.

580
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,020
And that is all Judge Pumpworth.

581
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,540
Yes.

582
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,540
We find many radio commentators.

583
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,340
All, in fact, all radio commentators do this.

584
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,300
I've seen him on TV.

585
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,020
He's got a whole courtroom there.

586
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,960
The Pumpworth's court.

587
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,980
Well, when they asked to approach the bench, they determined that this device was in use.

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,380
Right.

589
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,640
Even during regular sessions.

590
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,540
Sure, sure, sure.

591
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,360
Both civil and criminal cases.

592
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,260
Often they would hear it operating under.

593
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,340
Underneath his robes.

594
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,160
Isn't that true, Ivan?

595
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Yes.

596
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,420
Yes.

597
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,920
They would hear it happening.

598
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,480
It was a noisy.

599
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,680
A rather.

600
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,400
He must have gotten cocky, so to speak.

601
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,480
Yes, he thought he had everything.

602
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,100
How the mighty art falls.

603
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,440
Babylon the Great is no more.

604
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,760
I know where he's coming from.

605
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,660
So is that why all his decisions were acquittals?

606
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,820
Innocent?

607
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,600
Like, he just felt so good?

608
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm not sure he was as lenient as you might think.

609
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Well, if he was squeezing some air bottle just to get some action going in it.

610
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
Well, they didn't.

611
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,900
You call him the hanging judge for nothing.

612
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,200
No.

613
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,540
So it made him a little more kind of a down, down tempo kind of guy.

614
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:45,920
I mean.

615
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,440
You're just lucky you never had to go up before him.

616
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,140
Yes.

617
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,960
Especially depending on which day and which animal and which device.

618
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,660
Which position to assume.

619
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,240
Ah, Freeman.

620
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,500
A fellow scientist.

621
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,760
I certainly hope you know what you're doing.

622
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,740
I certainly hope you know what you're doing.

623
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,360
Do you suspect some alien subterfuge?

624
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,880
Behind this failure?

625
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,860
Absolutely.

626
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Absolutely not.

627
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,160
Why are you asking me?

628
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,720
Absolutely.

629
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,020
Absolutely not.

630
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,620
Why are you asking me?

631
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,300
Did you hear that?

632
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,700
No.

633
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
Did you hear something?

634
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,020
Alert!

635
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,020
Bogies!

636
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,580
No!

637
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,280
Dark!

638
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,680
Dark!

639
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,140
I don't want to die!

640
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,520
No!

641
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:24,940
Dark!

642
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,540
Dark!

643
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,940
I don't want to die!

644
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,320
No!

645
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,760
Please!

646
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,320
Please!

647
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,800
I don't want to die!

648
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,720
Dark!

649
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,080
Dark!

650
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,540
I don't want to die!

651
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,380
Cute!

652
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,880
Cute!

653
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm with the science team!

654
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,200
Cute!

655
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,640
Cute!

656
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,520
I'm with the science team!

657
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,380
Are you insane?

658
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,080
Stop attacking immediately!

659
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,300
Are you insane?

660
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,980
Stop attacking immediately!

661
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,580
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

662
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,500
Dark! Dark!

663
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,980
I don't want to die!

664
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,320
Dark! Dark!

665
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,780
I don't want to die!

666
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,140
Dark! Dark!

667
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,660
I don't want to die!

668
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,660
Dark!

669
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Dark!

670
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,480
I don't want to die!

671
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,880
Dark!

672
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,340
Dark!

673
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:31,780
A cut up there of Dr. Howell's performances on the popular game, computer game Half-Life,

674
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,280
I have no idea who did that mix.

675
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,960
Before that, you were hearing Dr. Howell and the rest of us on the Puzzling Evidence show

676
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,000
with John Doyce of Over the Edge.

677
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,760
But now, from Lemur, the news.

678
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,140
This is Denver, capital of the Rocky Mountain Empire.

679
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,020
In less than 90 years, Denver has grown from a tiny settlement of prospectors

680
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,280
to its present population of almost 400,000 government offices.

681
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,620
The Colorado Museum of Natural History contains Buffalo Bill.

682
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,360
At Colorado Springs, a monument has been dedicated to another famous untimely and tragic death.

683
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,500
Inside this shrine, rooms are devoted to death by millions.

684
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,160
The discovery of Will Rogers in 1858

685
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,960
started the development of the Federal Library,

686
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,840
the livestock playground of America.

687
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,960
In fact, over a million trout are issued annually in Colorado.

688
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,500
And now we arrive at Mesa Verde National Rock,

689
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,580
where an intelligent tribe of Indians provided by nature,

690
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,580
known as cliff gods, constructed America's first rock.

691
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,800
They were a religious people who worshiped the federal government

692
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
as the father of 43% of the population.

693
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,380
And they are the only people who have ever been able to

694
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,940
to be a part of the history of the nation.

695
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,740
And in this region, it seems fitting that we should sing our praises to a great drum.

696
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,360
Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

697
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,340
Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

698
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,440
Boo.

699
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,700
This is a story of a holiday.

700
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,840
Genocide.

701
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,220
Day.

702
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,800
One of the nicest days of the year.

703
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
We Johnson's had a good

704
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,280
Genocide.

705
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,580
Day.

706
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,100
The best we've ever had.

707
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,200
There is happiness in the air.

708
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,760
I keep thinking about

709
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,240
Genocide.

710
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,700
Day.

711
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,860
A real feeling of

712
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,160
denial.

713
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,500
A part of the fun.

714
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
Looking forward to

715
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,500
Genocide.

716
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:46,980
Day.

717
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,760
Turkey and dressing and pie and cake.

718
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,260
The arbitrary ability of the federal government of the United States

719
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,100
to repress the legitimate aspirations

720
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,160
for liberation of native people within its borders.

721
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,600
Turkey.

722
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,180
Turkey and dressing and pie and cake.

723
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,020
Mmm.

724
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,460
And fruit salad and whipped cream and cranberries.

725
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,820
Gee.

726
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,440
The genocide of American Indians.

727
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,560
Well, the truth of the matter is

728
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,940
Nations of people disappeared.

729
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,240
Friendly Indians.

730
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,640
And the smell of

731
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,400
False reality.

732
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Mmm.

733
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,740
We know mother knows how to

734
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,640
Perpetrate genocide.

735
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,980
And father knows how to

736
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,160
Perpetrate genocide.

737
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Right here.

738
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,360


739
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,140
Where we're sitting.

740
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,520
I don't think it's fair.

741
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,720
Learning to use a knife the right way takes practice.

742
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,720
Genocide.

743
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,760
Great American tradition.

744
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,820
Well, gee whiz, no, Dad.

745
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,720
We never have to talk.

746
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,540
Data that's readily available but never injected into the curriculum.

747
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:44,980
There.

748
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,220
There.

749
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,540
There.

750
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,440
For the public or private school system.

751
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,680
And that's odd, too.

752
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:48,980
Gee.

753
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,280
We'll just have to get along without

754
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,040
The Indians.

755
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,540
Mom, he don't mean it.

756
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,360
All the things free people working together can produce.

757
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,560
Population eradication occurred in order to allow the expropriation of the land.

758
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,940
Expropriation of the land precipitated the eradication of the population.

759
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,940
Take a drink.

760
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,480
Cool.

761
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,980
There are some things you just can't say.

762
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,260
It was the United States.

763
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:12,840
That's odd.

764
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,500
Genocide.

765
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,740
A lot of Americans have had it and will keep on having it.

766
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,300
Genocide.

767
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, you know.

768
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
It's negated.

769
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,540
It's ignored.

770
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,820
It's in fact suppressed.

771
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,380
It's not something fit for inclusion in polite academic discussion anywhere.

772
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,340
I am thankful for getting to know you.

773
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm getting plenty to eat all the time.

774
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,840
The Indians.

775
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,900
Same as always.

776
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,600
We like to

777
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,680
Perpetrate genocide.

778
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,840
And watch it.

779
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:52,420
We can talk about the massacre at Sand Creek, Colorado, or the massacre at San Luis, South Dakota, or the massacre at Washington River in Oklahoma, or the massacre at the Marias River in Montana, or the massacre at Horseshoe Bend in Alabama, or the massacre of those same Indians who fed those same starving pilgrims.

780
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,100
Pilgrims?

781
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,880
1620, 17 years later in 1637, the pilgrims walked down.

782
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,480
Growing up in America.

783
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,980
Mystic Pennsylvania and butchered off all the peacocks who had fed them in 1620, okay?

784
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,540
Fun.

785
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,160
Like something out of Caligula.

786
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,320
Now, could you wish for more?

787
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,820
Why don't we do it?

788
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,300
Now hold on a minute.

789
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,600
Dancing around dismembered bodies and in flippering flames in a dying village.

790
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,920
I'm glad to be able to go to Sunday school or go to any church I want any Sunday.

791
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,780
Dom's a false reality that had been constructed to shield the society from itself.

792
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,400
It is fine to have learned so much.

793
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,180
Some trust fund prosecutor got off message at Yale, thinks he's gonna run this up the flagpole?

794
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,640
Make a name for himself?

795
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:48,580
Maybe get elected some two-bit congressman from nowhere with the result that China or Russia can suddenly start having at our expense all the advantages we enjoy here?

796
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,420
No, I tell you, no, sir.

797
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,900
Corruption charges.

798
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,040
Corruption?

799
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,260
Corruption is government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation.

800
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,900
That's Milton Friedman.

801
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,080
He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.

802
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,400
We have laws against it precisely so we can get away with it.

803
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,560
Corruption is our protection.

804
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,120
Corruption keeps us safe and warm.

805
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,080
Corruption is why you and I are prancing around in here instead of fighting over scraps of meat out in the street.

806
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,040
Corruption is why we win.

807
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,380
Corruption is why we fight.

808
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,380


809
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,380


810
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,380


811
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,380


812
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,380


813
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,500
So that little thing.

814
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,040
Soon the creatures of the night shall rule the world.

815
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,880
And there is no one to stop it!

816
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,740
Hello, are you happy tax pays?

817
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,600
We are the dead.

818
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,900
A festering kingdom.

819
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,840
Colonial expansion.

820
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,660
A male state.

821
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,700
Wars throughout history have been waged for conquest and plunder.

822
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,720
And now,

823
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,120
the war is over.

824
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,580
The master class has always declared the wars,

825
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
and the subject class has always fought the battles.

826
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,260
The age of total warfare.

827
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,640
People were killed, including women and children.

828
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,840
In the midst of all these new diversions,

829
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,160
many in the working class lived in squalid conditions,

830
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,320
and often toiled 12 hours a day in factories or mines.

831
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,420
Bombings and assassinations.

832
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,180
Politics of imperialism.

833
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,580
Anger and fear.

834
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,460
The evils of the empire.

835
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,260
Technology made popularity profitable.

836
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Amuse the masses.

837
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,840
Gigantic amusement park.

838
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
Domestic abuse.

839
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,100
Heartless ways of modern society.

840
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,080
Heartless ways of modern society.

841
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,200
The rich earned their millions on the sweat and blood of children.

842
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,280
Thrive on the misery of the masses.

843
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,800
Rotting meat and garbage.

844
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,300
Emotional power.

845
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,900
Pathologies.

846
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,800
Suicide.

847
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,680
Tuberculosis.

848
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,600
Syphilis.

849
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,280
Alcoholism.

850
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,000
Poverty.

851
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,660
Rapid industrialization.

852
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,580
The great white fleet.

853
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,060
Carry a big stick.

854
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
Carry a big stick.

855
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,780
Political corruption.

856
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,540
Privilege.

857
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,600
The U.S. became the new invader.

858
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,320
Pushing their own economic and cultural values on other peoples.

859
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,820
Pushing their own economic and cultural values on other peoples.

860
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,160
The unbridled power of the capitalists and robber barons.

861
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,580
The lives of most Americans worsen.

862
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,280
The lives of the rich and the poor.

863
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,280


864
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,280


865
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,060
The lives of most Americans worsen.

866
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,440
Economically trapped.

867
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,480
Jim Crow society.

868
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,880
It was always a form of white control.

869
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,220
White supremacy.

870
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,020
State.

871
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,160
White violence.

872
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,580
Jim Crow.

873
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,720
Whites only.

874
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,740
Southern racism.

875
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,740
The Ku Klux Klan, a violent, racist organization.

876
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,420
One could hardly believe the happenings.

877
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,280
Citizenry was largely apathetic.

878
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,700
Spectators.

879
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,760
Huge fans of spectator sports.

880
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,280
New consumer culture.

881
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,040
Sideshow freaks.

882
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,420
Cheap and simple.

883
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,000
Wages were bad.

884
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Workers had virtually no power and no voice in American industry.

885
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,980
Toys for the rich.

886
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,540
Turning John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie into billionaires.

887
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,260
Vast and disparate country.

888
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,720
Vast and disparate country.

889
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,820
Neuroses or complexes.

890
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,960
Schizophrenic or psychotic.

891
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,380
Fascists.

892
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,640
Realtors.

893
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
They've conquered nature, they say, and made a great white world.

894
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,260
When you think about it, it's kind of mind-blowing.

895
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


896
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


897
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


898
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


899
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


900
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


901
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


902
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


903
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


904
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,880
You!

905
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,340
Can you.

906
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,260
Be.

907
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,200
Ty.

908
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,260
As the devil.

909
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,720
Owneth.

910
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,940
Hitler.

911
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,620
And Hell.

912
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,760
You!

913
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,200
Let see.

914
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,540
Policy.

915
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,460
For your country.

916
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,640
Hitler.

917
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,380
And Hell.

918
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,440
You!

919
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,000
They go.

920
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,560
Men must go.

921
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,980
They come.

922
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,640
Then they must come.

923
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,600
You!

924
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,160
If you ought to.

925
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


926
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


927
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


928
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


929
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


930
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


931
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


932
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,240


933
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,220
Oh, yeah.

934
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,220
Oh, yeah.

935
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,140
Oh, yeah.

936
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:55,980
Oh, yeah.

937
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,940
Oh, yeah.

938
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,160
Oh, yeah.

939
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
Oh, yeah.

940
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,300
And there's never one to say

941
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,160
People have gone

942
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,620
But it's us

943
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,340
Oh, you

944
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,980
You in the standing

945
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,860
Library

946
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,720
For your people in Germany

947
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
You

948
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,440
In the walking

949
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,080
And talking

950
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,960
Inside the pew

951
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,040
For your people in Germany

952
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,920
You

953
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,140
Welcome down

954
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,680
That whole stretch there was by Noriel Preff of norielpreff.com

955
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,800
Except for some quick clips that I pulled from Siriana, Monster Club, and an old Tex Avery cartoon.

956
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,960
Now, news.

957
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,140
Things are just getting started across New England with this latest central Ohio.

958
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,100
We can expect Connecticut across much of the east.

959
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,920
Sporadic outbreaks of Massachusetts with decreasing Florida now being reported.

960
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,460
As we begin to bite, chances are you're going to have some occasional Ohio for just about everybody to deal with.

961
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,220
Tell me why, baby, why, baby

962
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,640
Why, baby, why, baby, why, baby

963
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,980
Why, baby, why, baby

964
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm to be resettled in another country.

965
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,780
So, uh, uh, ma, na, sa, ya, ma, ma

966
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,960
Texas Governor Rick Perry destroyed and damaged dozens of people.

967
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,040
Perry says Texas is a secret domestic spying box.

968
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,560
We are as high as, uh

969
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,900
Wall Street.

970
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,820
7-7-10-7-7-2-6.

971
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,120
Officials say this is PR News.

972
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,720
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter plans to hold Judith Miller, who received PR News.

973
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,400
Our top story this hour, the Justice Department says it is PR News in Washington.

974
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,200
I used to wonder what it'd be like

975
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,420
To live and work upon the Death Star

976
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,220
Till I grew up inside a vast,

977
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,360
Not corrupting evil empire

978
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,900
And now I'd like to think I'd riot

979
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,920
I'd be the leader of a well planned riot.

980
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,240
I'd be the leader of a well planned riot.

981
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,920
I'd sing but all my life is rather quiet

982
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,380
Oh and besides I'm not exactly known for stirring a thing

983
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,920
I'd like to rally round the emperor

984
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,660
Or I'd participate in his states

985
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,500
Definitely necessary

986
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:42,740
Well I'd focus forth on us

987
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,980
That could be a Baz surprised your kadar

988
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,500
I'll stay young and full of piss and vinegar

989
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,780
And I used to say, oh I'll stay young and full of beans

990
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,400
And yet somehow I got older

991
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,760
Oh and I started caring less and less and less

992
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,600
And I grew up into complacence

993
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,820
I hoped the rebels would retreat or at least digress

994
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,400
But it appears they put the ante

995
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,860
And it appears they plan to follow it through with the threats

996
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,700
And the rhetoric from both sides

997
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,840
Sticks me somewhere in the middle of it

998
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,380
Sticks me somewhere in the middle of it

999
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,840
If every action has a consequence

1000
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,760
Then how come I cannot foresee the future of it?

1001
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,960
And I say, if every action has a consequence

1002
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,780
Then how come I cannot foresee the future of it?

1003
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,340
And I say

1004
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,280
If every action has a consequence

1005
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,120
Then how come I cannot foresee the future of it?

1006
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,860
But how did I make the time to sleep?

1007
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,560
How did I cane the檜

1008
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,920
How did I Milliarden

1009
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,180
I handed over all my freedoms

1010
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,520
So I could feel all warm and safe and secure

1011
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,460
But I can tell there's something wrong here

1012
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,680
I had a feeling that something bad is bound to occur

1013
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,440
I'm scared to death here on the Death Star

1014
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,820
I'm afraid of what I'm sure is coming next

1015
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,300
See, I don't want to die inside the belly of the beast

1016
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,600
That chuckled me upon her chest

1017
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,540
And now it's right here at my doorstep

1018
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,380
And now it's breathing down my neck

1019
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,640
And now it's right here at my doorstep

1020
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
And now it's breathing down my neck

1021
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,320
Here at my doorstep

1022
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,500
In a galaxy far, far away

1023
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,260
Here at my doorstep

1024
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,560
In a galaxy far, far away

1025
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,320
Here at my doorstep

1026
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,520
In a galaxy far, far away

1027
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,420
Far, far away, here at my doorstep.

1028
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,140
Near the galaxy.

1029
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,400
Far, far away, here at my doorstep.

1030
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,760
The Goodyear Pimps from thepimps.org.

1031
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,960
A great song among many friends.

1032
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,960
I would love to see that band at X Day.

1033
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,520
Man, that would just be great.

1034
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,180
Right, thepimps.org.

1035
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,780
Tell them Hour of Slack sent you.

1036
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,840
Now, we're going to explain the Kennedy assassination.

1037
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,020
This following comes from Radio Synesthesia, Dr. Sinister's show,

1038
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,600
which follows Hour of Slack in Cleveland on WCSB.

1039
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,400
I don't believe in the Warren Commission kooks,

1040
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
and I don't believe the CIA did it.

1041
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,880
I'm one of the mafia did it kooks.

1042
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,920
And the nice thing about this new book is that it explains

1043
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,340
how the mafia was able to get away with it.

1044
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,040
Does it talk about the storm sewer theory?

1045
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,540
Does it mention the UFOs being involved in this?

1046
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,520
Does it mention the UFOs being involved?

1047
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,720
The big book of conspiracies.

1048
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,020
I was really impressed with that book

1049
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,760
and the way it was able to tie everything back to the UFOs somehow.

1050
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,500
That was a real mess.

1051
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:42,860
It has to work.

1052
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,460
It's on my shelf today.

1053
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,460
No, the Kennedy assassination, as far as I can tell,

1054
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:56,740
was probably pulled off by the three different mobster groups

1055
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,640
working together who had previously worked with the CIA

1056
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,540
on anti-Castro projects.

1057
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,480
One of them would have been Lucky Luciano, wouldn't it?

1058
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:06,920
No.

1059
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,720
It wasn't?

1060
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,860
No, Marcello Traficante and Roselli.

1061
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,360
Oh.

1062
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:12,620
Okay.

1063
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,940
They were mobsters in Florida and Louisiana and Chicago

1064
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,000
who had been very involved with Bay of Pigs type stuff

1065
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,220
before that happened.

1066
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
And they knew about certain plans that the Kennedys had

1067
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,700
that were not known until this book came out publicly.

1068
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,900
Partly because these guys put together some...

1069
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,820
You know, there's a continuous release of information

1070
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,500
of information being published.

1071
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,260
It's been declassified.

1072
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,120
And these guys have been right on top of all of that.

1073
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,720
Plus, they talked to people who had been very high up

1074
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,740
in the government, like Dean Rusk

1075
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,540
and various military, retired military guys

1076
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,740
who actually were part of this plot by the Kennedys.

1077
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,680
Not the CIA, but the Kennedys,

1078
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,980
with some help from the CIA and the mafia.

1079
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,780
But this is like after Bay of Pigs.

1080
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,220
The Kennedys had a plan to get Cuba back.

1081
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,720
And there's some really surprising information

1082
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,200
about who they had on their side in Cuba

1083
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,440
ready to pull off a coup.

1084
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,660
And those plans for a coup

1085
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,100
and the connections with the mafia and so forth

1086
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,160
were part of the embarrassing things

1087
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,500
that the Kennedy family did not want known,

1088
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,400
nor did anybody else in the government particularly want known,

1089
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,520
which is why they let the obvious cover-up

1090
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,980
of the Warren Commission go on.

1091
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,080
They knew that it was...

1092
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,500
A mob...

1093
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,020
A mob hit and why and so forth.

1094
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,340
But if they had...

1095
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,220
Exposing that would have exposed so many other things

1096
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,660
that it would have wrecked a lot of the good works

1097
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,340
or what they considered at the time to be good works

1098
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,020
that the Kennedy administration had in mind.

1099
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,700
Those good works being the assassination of Castro.

1100
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,820
Which we know that's common knowledge,

1101
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,260
that the CIA and the mafia would work together

1102
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,080
trying to get rid of Castro.

1103
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,500
But what is known...

1104
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,720
What they knew is that the Kennedys had their own plan.

1105
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,160
And the guy they had on the inside in Cuba

1106
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,240
is a really surprising name.

1107
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,620
It's hard to spell it out because it sounds so crazy.

1108
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,740
But imagine if Che Guevara had decided

1109
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,700
that Castro was full of crap after the revolution

1110
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,700
and decided, you know,

1111
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,440
that he wanted to work with somebody else

1112
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,840
to get Castro out of there.

1113
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,340
For a second I thought you were going to say

1114
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,540
they were going to install Che Guevara.

1115
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,040
I'm like, whoa.

1116
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,940
That would have been something.

1117
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,020
Well, working with the mafia is not unusual for our government.

1118
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,420
Back when the CIA was the OSS,

1119
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,940
we used the mafia to help us...

1120
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,540
Right, well that is why the mafia knew

1121
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,840
so much embarrassing stuff about the Kennedys.

1122
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,360
And they did not like the Kennedys

1123
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,420
because the Kennedys had basically

1124
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,380
kind of double-crossed them in a way.

1125
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,380
J. Edgar Hoover really had to do that.

1126
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,480
The Kennedys really went after the mafia

1127
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,400
in an unexpectedly fervent way.

1128
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,300
Well, they also...

1129
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,020
Well, they also...

1130
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1131
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1132
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1133
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1134
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1135
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1136
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1137
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1138
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,020


1139
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,800
The more they were going after Jimmy Hoffa, though.

1140
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,040
Well, he was part of that whole bunch.

1141
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:15,520
Right.

1142
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,780
You know, the CIA just tried so many

1143
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,120
silly things to try and get rid of...

1144
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,100
You know, the real reason Castro quit smoking

1145
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,120
is because, like,

1146
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,680
they kept trying to poison his cigars all the time

1147
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,780
and he's like, that's it, I quit.

1148
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,040
You know, it's...

1149
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,000
Anyway, this...

1150
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,400
I would highly recommend

1151
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
if you're...

1152
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,840
You know, for a really serious, non-kooky

1153
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,020
and extremely well-deserved,

1154
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


1155
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


1156
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


1157
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


1158
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,800
undocumented history

1159
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,040
of the Kennedy assassination,

1160
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,740
the book is called Ultimate Sacrifice

1161
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,060
and there's a website,

1162
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,920
ultimatesacrificethebook.com

1163
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,680
where you can get a whole lot of the details

1164
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,780
and so forth.

1165
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,180
It's...

1166
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,600
I know it doesn't involve UFOs

1167
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,660
and it's the prosaic, plain explanation

1168
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,500
for the Kennedy assassination

1169
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,800
in some ways.

1170
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,340
You know, it's like, no, there...

1171
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,020
It wasn't Johnson working with...

1172
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,020
You know, evil CIA guys.

1173
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,840
It was...

1174
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,020
It was really, really...

1175
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,940
It was the rival government.

1176
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,720
You know, it was the secret government

1177
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,140
that works underneath

1178
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,860
the existing public government.

1179
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,420
You know, that's...

1180
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,200
You know, the second biggest organized

1181
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,340
criminal mob in the country,

1182
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,040
the mafia.

1183
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,040
Yeah, they're second only to the government?

1184
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,320
Right.

1185
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,860
Yeah.

1186
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,600
Right, I mean, that's what a government is.

1187
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,920
It's the most successful organized...

1188
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,420
So successful they actually get people to...

1189
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,540
You know, to actually sign on

1190
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,700
to be a...

1191
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,360
What's the word I'm looking for?

1192
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,300
Swindled?

1193
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,180
Swindled?

1194
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,020
Maybe? I don't know.

1195
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,440
No, when you're private in the army,

1196
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,500
you're an enforcer for the government mob

1197
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,120
to a certain degree.

1198
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,140
Button man.

1199
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,460
Button man.

1200
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,000
Yep.

1201
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,420
And then you press a button.

1202
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,120
Ah, yes.

1203
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,540
I don't...

1204
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,800
I do not pretend to be a big expert.

1205
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,380
I'm not an expert on this.

1206
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,320
I'm, uh...

1207
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,520
But I know that this Kennedy researcher,

1208
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,100
I've known him the whole time.

1209
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,340
He's been working on this book 17 years.

1210
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,120
That's a long time to research a book.

1211
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,100
Sounds like...

1212
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,260
But he wants to get the facts right.

1213
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,360
We need all life funds.

1214
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,000
Again.

1215
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:26,980
Aggression.

1216
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,440
I love you!

1217
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,700
Anger and fear.

1218
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,540
Downing Street.

1219
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,020
Everything is commercialized.

1220
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,700
Brothers of Christ.

1221
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,040
You are the boomer man.

1222
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,040
Questionable conduct.

1223
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,360
Ronald Reagan burning in hell.

1224
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,300
Bush is a puppet.

1225
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,540
I have an uncomfortable feeling.

1226
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,420
War is peace.

1227
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,680
I have an uncomfortable feeling.

1228
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,680
Bush is a puppet.

1229
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,940
Ronald Reagan burning in hell.

1230
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,780
Questionable conduct.

1231
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,940
You are the boomer man.

1232
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,800
Brothers of Christ.

1233
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,800
Everything is commercialized.

1234
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,000
Downing Street.

1235
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,340
Anger and fear.

1236
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,280
I love you!

1237
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,040
Aggression.

1238
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,200
Again.

1239
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,740
I have all life funds.

1240
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,400
Again.

1241
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,420
Aggression.

1242
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,800
I love you!

1243
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,080
Anger and fear.

1244
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,920
Downing Street.

1245
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,400
Everything is commercialized.

1246
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,020
Brothers of Christ.

1247
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,380
You are the boomer man.

1248
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,400
Questionable conduct.

1249
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,720
Ronald Reagan burning in hell.

1250
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,680
Bush is a puppet.

1251
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,900
I have an uncomfortable feeling.

1252
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,780
War is peace.

1253
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,320
Some kind of madness.

1254
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,240
Yeah.

1255
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,560
I think maybe everything might as well come out now.

1256
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,160
Yeah?

1257
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,700
And then we might as well set up some kind of a kangaroo court.

1258
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,840
Now how about a firing squad of dogs?

1259
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,620
I've never seen it.

1260
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,340
How come you're so dense all of a sudden?

1261
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,240
I talk to monsters from outer space.

1262
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,000
I talk to three-headed green men who fly over here in what look like meteors.

1263
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,360
You're all standing out here all set to crucify somebody.

1264
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,660
You're all set to find a scapegoat.

1265
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,240
We're gonna eat each other up alive.

1266
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,780
It's the monster.

1267
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,700
It's the monster.

1268
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,480
And you're gonna eat me alive.

1269
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,380
Well, he came out of the darkness.

1270
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,420
No.

1271
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:47,940
Look.

1272
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,560
Charlie.

1273
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,340
It isn't Bob.

1274
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,320
Sit back and watch the pattern.

1275
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,400
And this pattern is always the same?

1276
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,200
With few variations.

1277
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,980
They pick the most dangerous enemy they can find.

1278
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,700
And it's themselves.

1279
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,900
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices.

1280
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,500
To be found only in the minds of men.

1281
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,460
And a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own.

1282
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,640
Not my thing.

1283
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,560
Fast food, not fast enough.

1284
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,240
That's just crazy talk.

1285
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,800
Moving.

1286
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,860
And it was...

1287
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,720
I like this guy.

1288
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,800
Surrounded by worshippers with a mean right jab.

1289
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,940
Nobody knows, but the music never stops.

1290
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,880
Thank you, brother.

1291
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:34,620
Thank you, brother.

1292
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,200
Excuse me.

1293
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,660
Trucks and SUVs.

1294
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,500
Excuse me.

1295
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,720
Check out the stone for golden arches in the back.

1296
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,320
This is a McDonald's.

1297
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,240
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1298
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,600
Fancy feel at a fast food restaurant.

1299
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,380
Fast food, extra fast.

1300
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,260
From Al-Qaeda.

1301
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,180
Taking a dip, plunging it in the deep end.

1302
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,660
A few things haven't changed.

1303
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,180
The government.

1304
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,960
What stops the president from issuing another order and say,

1305
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,920
Ops, ops, ops, op, op, op, op.

1306
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,460
Enemy combatant again.

1307
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,740
Criminal justice.

1308
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,760
Without justice.

1309
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,860
Push comes to shove.

1310
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,060
The earth is still flat.

1311
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:06,980
We're dysfunctional.

1312
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,720
We're dysfunctional.

1313
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:08,480
Confident.

1314
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,800
And happy celibates.

1315
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,700
President Dick.

1316
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,380
He is gay.

1317
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,360
Homosexual acts are, quote,

1318
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,120
It simply follows God's law.

1319
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,000
President Dick remains gay.

1320
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,520
He's coming out.

1321
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,500
He's coming out.

1322
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,160
The most corrupt.

1323
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,100
President Dick.

1324
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,660
Fameless, famous.

1325
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,120
The White House deliberately manipulated pre-war intelligence.

1326
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Increasingly acrimonious.

1327
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:27,900
Pull out.

1328
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,620
Pull out now.

1329
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,300
Sudden withdrawal should answer a few simple questions.

1330
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:31,860
Are we?

1331
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,180
Are we?

1332
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,560
Are we?

1333
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,200
Are we?

1334
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,440
Are we?

1335
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,000
Are we?

1336
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,500
Are we?

1337
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,500


1338
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,820
Are we?

1339
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,180
Are we?

1340
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:36,400
Are we?

1341
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,400


1342
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,400


1343
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,400


1344
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,400


1345
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,420
Are we?

1346
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1347
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1348
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,000
Are we?

1349
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:37,660
Are we?

1350
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,280
I don't think that...

1351
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,100
That...

1352
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,900
That...

1353
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,220
That...

1354
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:41,500
Doug.

1355
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:41,980
Doug.

1356
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,720
Oh, blunt.

1357
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,140
Buster.

1358
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh, John.

1359
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,440
But look.

1360
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,640
Look at, you know...

1361
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,980
You know...

1362
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,620
Polygamy.

1363
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,540
Legalized.

1364
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,300
Prostitution.

1365
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,200
Legalized.

1366
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,000
The age of consent dropped to 12.

1367
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,380
And on and on.

1368
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,500
And on and on.

1369
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,260
And...

1370
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:56,780
And...

1371
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,200
Not...

1372
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,420
Not...

1373
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:57,660
Not...

1374
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,040
Not really.

1375
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,360
Really.

1376
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:58,620
Really.

1377
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:58,840
Really.

1378
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,320
But I...

1379
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,800
But I...

1380
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,400
Idiot.

1381
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,940
It's not...

1382
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,200
It's Hawk.

1383
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,420
Somebody that they beg for...

1384
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,480
Somebody that they beg for Hawk.

1385
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:04,620
Hawk.

1386
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,320
In the...

1387
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,820
In the...

1388
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,280
In his...

1389
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,720
In the...

1390
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,200
In the...

1391
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,640
In his...

1392
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,120
Pulling up...

1393
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,660
Back of the books.

1394
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,280
Back of the books.

1395
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,920
Back of the books.

1396
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,500
Back of the books.

1397
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,700
Doors are using...

1398
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,140
Doors are using...

1399
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,260
JCPenney's, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Dillard's.

1400
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:15,700
So...

1401
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,060
JCPenney's, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Dillard's.

1402
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,760
Okay, that's nice.

1403
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,360
So we're not too interested with Mary.

1404
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,600
Don't really care about Mary.

1405
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,420
The war.

1406
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,920
Why it's worse than you thought.

1407
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,760
This is so incredibly stupid.

1408
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,160
Incredibly stupid.

1409
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:29,800
Stupid.

1410
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,380
Stupid.

1411
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,020
I can't be this dumb.

1412
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,800
Denigrated.

1413
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,240
Disrespected.

1414
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:34,820
And...

1415
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,100
And...

1416
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,680
And...

1417
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:35,760
And...

1418
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,020
By...

1419
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,480
By...

1420
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:36,760
By...

1421
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:36,820
By...

1422
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,100
By...

1423
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,780
Get...

1424
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,060
Religion...

1425
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,700
Out.

1426
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,560
Gay marriage.

1427
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,240
Uh...

1428
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,880
Uh...

1429
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,360
You have legalized prostitution.

1430
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,000
You have drugs.

1431
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:45,940
All those things come in.

1432
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,780
You can shove indoors.

1433
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,900
Who's this baby Jesus guy?

1434
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,360
Right.

1435
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,780
You know?

1436
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,420
Get...

1437
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,740
Religion...

1438
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,320
Out.

1439
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,760
Hey, you bunch of dumb guys!

1440
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
You'll be sorry!

1441
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,260
Um, what happened in all these places?

1442
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,300
Altova, Salgeria...

1443
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:05,480
Hey.

1444
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,480
And then...

1445
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,440
Well...

1446
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,040
And...

1447
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,600
And...

1448
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:08,600


1449
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,280
So...

1450
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:09,600
So...

1451
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:09,600


1452
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:09,860
Um...

1453
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,180
The...

1454
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,640
And...

1455
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,200
Um...

1456
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,520
Uh...

1457
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,400
So...

1458
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,400


1459
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,640
And so...

1460
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,440
Uh...

1461
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,060
Uh...

1462
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,520
Uh...

1463
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,460
So...

1464
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:16,860
Uh...

1465
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,120
Lemur.

1466
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,000
If...

1467
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,260
Fernanda and Andy Lemur.

1468
