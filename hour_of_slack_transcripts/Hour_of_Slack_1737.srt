1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,800
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,600
The genius, our...

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,840
I don't like it, Joe.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,580
Yeah, me too.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,140
We'll just have to sweat this out, handle whatever it is when it happens.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,920
Joe, maybe if you went to him and said that you had to change your mind about...

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,100
Bob?

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,180
I don't know.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,820
I don't know.

11
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,460
I don't know.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,760
I don't know.

13
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,960
I don't know.

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't know.

15
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,440
And, of course, if you couldn't tell there, the Reverend Ivan Stang himself.

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
He's feeling mighty gingery and petty for his age.

17
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,140
So, there's 80 million things we could probably talk about, but...

18
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,080
That's way too many.

19
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,860
I don't have...

20
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:45,900
Yeah.

21
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
I can't possibly talk about that many.

22
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,220
We won't have that much time until the saucers take us away.

23
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,760
Yes, then there will be infinite time suspended in the timeless realm of space

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,940
to tell the same old stories over and over.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,040
over again. Just like that

26
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
old gospel song, you know,

27
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,840
the one old ladies used to like about

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,880
Twill be my theme in glory

29
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,560
to tell the old, old story.

30
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,780
You'd think anybody who was there

31
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,120
would know that story. And yet,

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,040
when you see Mabel coming at

33
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,780
you and you know she's going to tell that story,

34
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,060
you can't say, stop! I don't want to

35
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,960
hear that story because you're in

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,000
heaven. Now there's

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040
all the time in the world

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,960
to listen to Mabel tell that

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
story. Pull up a cloud.

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
She's going to tell it again.

41
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,940
And there'll be an exam

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,840
right afterwards.

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,060
You know, I never did very well in that.

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm not so sure I'm in heaven.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
I never did very well in physics, but it just occurred to me that maybe

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
just maybe this is a way you could get

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,520
yourself to have an infinite amount of time

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,960
as if you could get the rest

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,860
of the universe to start moving at the speed of light.

50
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,160
And if you were the only object

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,860
in the universe that was not moving at the speed of light,

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,040
then maybe you would actually have forever.

53
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,780
Well, you'd have existed

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,880
but everything else in the universe would not

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,300
as far as we know because

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,840
nothing in our universe can go

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,700
that fast.

58
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,760
You see, the atoms and stuff

59
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,800
like that are already going real

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,900
fast, but then when they have to

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,780
go the speed of light,

62
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,500
that's just faster than they can go.

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,200
It's impossible for anything with mass.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,060
With a bunch of nothing except for you.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,220
Which is kind of how life feels already.

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,100
The solipsistic fringe.

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,520
Ah, yes, indeed.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,640
If it weren't for solipsism,

69
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,020
I wouldn't have any thoughts at all.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
Actually, that's not entirely true.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,300
Keep it clean.

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,920
Oh, I keep it very clean.

73
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,220
Everything except myself.

74
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,160
The Hour of Slack is a compendium

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,620
of the funniest and newest

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,980
from all the church of the subgenius

77
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,080
radio and stage shows, bands,

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,820
ranters, and collage artists,

79
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
plus some of the weirdest

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,420
of the indie audio underground.

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,380
It has been produced weekly since

82
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,380
1985 by

83
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,040
Reverend,

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,680
Reverend,

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:57,740
Reverend,

86
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,740


87
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,760
Reverend,

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:57,760


89
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:57,760


90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,780
Reverend Stang.

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,600
I wrote that.

92
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,980
And a cast of hundreds, and it's syndicated

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,100
to several other college and independent

94
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,960
stations.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,880
And it truly is fun for the whole family.

96
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,480
Fun for the whole family.

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,700
Some family.

98
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,960
Yeah, my family loves it.

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,420
Yeah, the holes love it.

100
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,040
For kids from 6 to 60 and oldsters and 90 years young.

101
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
Mr. and Mrs. Hole and little Junior Hole

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,020
and Betty Hole.

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,620
Hi.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,160
They love the Hour of Slack.

105
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,740
Fun for the whole family.

106
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,860
All the holes here.

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah.

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,420
All the holes.

109
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,800
Yes, the B holes, the C holes,

110
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,120
and of course the A holes.

111
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,400
They love the show,

112
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,800
and they prove it by their

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,300
constant contributions,

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,360
donations, and calling in

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,260
live to this program.

116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,620
And that number is

117
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,920
216-687-3515.

118
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,240
This is your chance to actually ask Dr. Howell.

119
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,480
That's right.

120
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,420
You can ask me who killed

121
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,360
the toads in the rice that killed

122
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
the poppy cockalorum and the cockahoo, Patrice.

123
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm pretty sure it was the Jabberwocky.

124
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,280
You're not supposed to.

125
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,680
Well, all right.

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Okay, well, you don't have to worry about that one.

127
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,460
And what name Achilles used

128
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,320
when he hid himself among women?

129
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,120
And what songs the sirens sang

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
which Sir Thomas Brown said

131
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
that somebody might figure out someday?

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,940
So call in, because I'm here

133
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,500
and I'm a-waitin' to answer your questions.

134
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,920
We were hoping to hear from Dave again,

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,340
and sadly, we didn't pick up.

136
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,940
We'll pick up in time, and hopefully he'll try again.

137
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,200
Well, he's listening. He's standing by.

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
He's getting ready.

139
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,520
He's arming himself to go into battle for Bob.

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,100
Well, most people call that

141
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,560
going to the bathroom again.

142
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,600
I was trying to save his blushes

143
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,580
from this embarrassing...

144
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,100
He blew that cover

145
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,240
the last show.

146
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,640
I truly believe that every bowel movement

147
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
should advance the plot somehow.

148
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,080
Well, you know, we shouldn't be too arch about this,

149
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,880
because think of all the greatness

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,900
which has come out of those private moments.

151
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,140
Beethoven composing his greatest music

152
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,800
and others, once behind the privacy door.

153
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,680
This even continues into the modern age,

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,300
why no less than Eminem claims that he invented

155
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,880
the character of Slim Shady

156
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,640
while practicing excremeditation.

157
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,640
It's quite possible, because the slack time

158
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,540
is the time when creative ideas fluoresce.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,540
Screamin' Jay Hawkins said it all.

160
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,620
Grrrrrr!

161
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,080
Grrrrrr!

162
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,300
Let it out! Let it out!

163
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,360
This is a song about real pain!

164
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,700
That's why they called him Screamin' Jay.

165
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,640
Yep.

166
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,520
You know, I have not played a single poop song

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,340
in months on my program.

168
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,880
Oh, dearie me, no.

169
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,120
How could it be?

170
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,520
I've got a collection that you should probably have.

171
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
I just put two and two together.

172
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,680
So Reverend Klopp, I think, did...

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Uh-oh.

174
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
These are so NPC.

175
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,900
I can't even say the name of the band.

176
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,420
When we were overseas...

177
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,220
Can you give us a euphemistic...

178
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,960
We were on Tommy Chong's show

179
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,640
and reprimanded for our scatological propensities.

180
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,560
The Differently Abled Poop Band, you might say.

181
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,360
Oh, righty.

182
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,620
Their songs were...

183
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,440
When you say differently abled...

184
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,960
Mentally challenged.

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,020
Did they use the word retarded?

186
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
See, I think it's okay to use that word

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,580
as long as it's, like, not as an insult.

189
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,960
It used to be the nice word.

190
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,380
It used to be a euphemism.

191
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,840
You weren't feeble-minded, which is the old word.

192
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,880
You were retarded, which means it's not even you.

193
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,440
Something is holding you back.

194
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,200
You're just a little slow.

195
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,660
And then, you know, words like moron and idiot

196
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,880
used to be clinical terms,

197
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,380
and then they became insults.

198
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,580
I worked on several documentary films

199
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,980
for the National Association of Retarded Citizens,

200
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,020
which is what they were called, or NARC.

201
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,440
N-A-R-C.

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
Yes, a coincidence.

203
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,160
They changed the name.

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,460
Yeah, I wouldn't trust a group with that name.

205
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Well, they did, you know, they realized

206
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,780
they had to use a different word than the word.

207
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,660
Yeah, well, constant expansion and contraction of language

208
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,620
creates some of these amusing conundrums.

209
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,600
That cassette is in Glen Rose, Texas, though.

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,500
I know where it is.

211
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,180
Oh, that's where they have that creation science museum

212
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,620
down there, don't they?

213
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,940
Oh, yeah, I can't wait to take you to that one.

214
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,380
Noah's Ark and so forth.

215
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,740
I cannot wait to get you there.

216
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,380
Bulging with dinosaurs.

217
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,340
Are you going to go visit in Kentucky?

218
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,220
Philodromand?

219
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,880
Philodromand, yeah.

220
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,800
Well, on the way?

221
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,360
I don't know.

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,020
Are you going to stop in at Philo's ranch?

223
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,520
No.

224
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,220
No.

225
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
He's a different direction.

226
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh, all right.

227
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,640
If you can put it that way, I think I understand what you mean.

228
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,160
We stopped there between Ohio and Kentucky.

229
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,160


230
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,680
We're going to go to Ohio and Texas if we're not pulling a big trailer.

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
But we will be next time.

232
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:07,180
And the road from the highway to Philo's house is as daunting as the road from the highway to our house.

233
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,140
Wow.

234
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,020
Really daunting.

235
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,820
And you basically better not bring a trailer, a heavily laden trailer down that road.

236
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,280
Yeah, when are they going to fix up that road over the Borgo Pass that leads to Castle Dracula?

237
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,020
Nobody seems to want to do that.

238
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,320
I don't know what this is like.

239
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,880
It's pretty spooky driving to Philo's house the first couple of times.

240
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,240
Once you get past the booby traps and things, it's beautiful.

241
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,040
It's really, really gorgeous.

242
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:49,400
However, when they took me for a little walk in the woods, I came back with four ticks whose jaws are still implanted in my skin.

243
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,280
Huge, horrible, grape-like, bulging body.

244
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,460
No.

245
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,280
I got them before they got that big.

246
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,920
Oh, well.

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,460
The dogs didn't get any because the dogs take medicine that keeps ticks off them.

248
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,360
But they don't allow no humans to take that medicine.

249
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,800
No.

250
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh, and we've been told that the tickery is really bad where we're going, Dr. House.

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,360
No, they love me too because I taste so good.

252
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,800
Why do you think we always bring you to X-Day?

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,140
You see all these—

254
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,980
He keeps the flies off of me.

255
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,760
The bloodsuckers, they like the blood that has just the right proportion of sugar and fat in there.

256
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,520
And they don't care about anybody else's blood once they can get that vintage stuff, that good stuff.

257
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,960
Dr. House, he sure does keep the flies off this watermelon.

258
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,060
Well, what about that weird superstition where you tack up a bag of water over the door and that's the point?

259
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,960
That's not a superstition.

260
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,900
My father-in-law did that.

261
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,780
And it keeps the flies away?

262
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,080
It kept the flies away.

263
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,840
Baggies of water hanging outside his woodshop.

264
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,280
Well, actually they were hanging all around inside the woodshop.

265
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,700
And somehow it seemed to throw off the flies' little fly dar.

266
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,480
The flies are thinking, there shouldn't be water in there.

267
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,040
This is crazy. It's insane. Let's get out of here.

268
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
It works. It works.

269
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,660
It poked her nostril started using it.

270
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,120
All right, let's remember that for X-Day. Staple up those bags all around the stage.

271
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,040
Yes, thanks for having me.

272
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,420
That's right.

273
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,020
Now, if you want to hear the whole story, the only way to do that is to get on down to Wisteria.

274
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,080
Get on down?

275
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes, get ye down to Wisteria.

276
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,980
Let's look at the weather forecast for this week at Wisteria.

277
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,360
Oh, no.

278
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Actually, it's improved, Princess Wee. It's not going to be thunderstorms all week long anymore.

279
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,500
Oh, good.

280
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,560
Oh, wait. No, they've come back.

281
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,540
It changed to rain on Monday.

282
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,520
We won't be there. It's over with. The world's over by Monday.

283
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,860
But, yeah, it's a good prediction of X-Day.

284
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,140
It's a cloud with a lightning bolt coming down, climaxing on Friday the 5th.

285
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,820
It'll only be 89 degrees.

286
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,180
89 degrees?

287
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,500
That's normal, actually.

288
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,720
We've had much, much worse with 89% humidity.

289
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,960
Well, I remember that lightning crack that happened while we were doing our broadcast.

290
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,400
Remember?

291
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,860
Remember it ran downhill into the little dingley dell where the grindhouse was?

292
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,120
Cue miracle lightning recording.

293
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

294
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,480
How much room on the saucers?

295
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,860
Holy .

296
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
Don't worry, folks.

297
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,180
They've heard it a million times, because every time we bring it up, I've got a little file.

298
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,700
I just have to type search for the word lightning, and it pops up.

299
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,720
Hmm.

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,580
You can hear G. Gordon Gordon react to it with a bad word.

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,780
Holy .

302
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,640
Hmm.

303
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,260
Holy .

304
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,080
Yes, exactly. You can imagine.

305
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
Fill in expletive right there.

306
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,860
Yeah, I'll never forget.

307
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,700
It happened right down the hill from me.

308
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,080
I was there.

309
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,700
Maybe 100 points. Everybody was there.

310
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,880
But it happened to hit the grindhouse.

311
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,540
Yes.

312
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,780
Which is a tent full of projectors,

313
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,360
run by Reverend Fight C. Taj.

314
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,760
Bob, bless him.

315
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,460
Yeah.

316
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,520
And, uh...

317
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,800
I never saw that guy run so fast.

318
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,600
Well, you just...

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,340
When he realized what...

320
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,900
His britches were a burden.

321
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,920
He flew down there.

322
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,300
Yeah.

323
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,420
Yes.

324
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,680
It didn't hurt his stuff.

325
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,680
Now, once lightning struck the other campground,

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,500
whose name we shan't mention,

327
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,780
because of the identity theft.

328
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,300
Yeah.

329
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,920
And it hit a big metal pole that was in the middle of the place.

330
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,820
Yeah.

331
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,520
And people for about 100 feet around that pole fell down unconscious.

332
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,520
One of them was Bleepo's wife,

333
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,260
who said that...

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,040
None of them were injured,

335
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,580
but she said that all day she felt like

336
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,240
she'd been using the same batteries her whole life

337
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
and had just been changed.

338
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,360
At least she didn't turn into a pillar of salt.

339
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,400
I wonder if that was like a form of divine electroconvulsive therapy.

340
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,800
It was to show them that they had strayed from the truth.

341
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,420
They had strayed from the slackful path by their attitude.

342
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,840
Well, it was a campground full of witches.

343
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,160
Of course Jehovah's gonna be hurling lightning bolts.

344
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,500
Well, where was Hecate?

345
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,300
He missed, though.

346
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,920
That's the telling thing.

347
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Hecate wasn't on duty to deflect it, or maybe she did.

348
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah, that's exactly it, Dr. Howell.

349
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,540
Hecate was there foiling the patriarchal father god's plan.

350
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
You know, and I have to say, I can't stand the idea of,

351
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,980
you know,

352
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,400
I like it to be colder than a witch's titty,

353
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,620
and I don't like it to be any warmer than a witch's titty.

354
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,320
Like, that's too hot already, you know?

355
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,820
I can't use this stuff.

356
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Having a...

357
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
That's one of the bad words you can't say.

358
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,660
You can't say.

359
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,300
Before 11 o'clock, yeah, titty.

360
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,640
I said it.

361
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,240
I heard a disclaimer, and it's not really that big a dirty word,

362
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,740
because I used the diminutive form.

363
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,740
Right, it's not, yeah.

364
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,300
Perhaps you're familiar with the Clark Ashton Smith poem,

365
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,400
The Witch with Eyes of Amber?

366
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,340
Which describes just that phenomenon.

367
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,700
The cold mammary gland of a practitioner of the sorcerous arts.

368
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,180
I met a witch with amber eyes

369
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,800
Who slowly sang a scarlet rune

370
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,480
Shifting to an icy laughter

371
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,540
Like the laughter of the moon

372
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,120
Red as a wanton's was her mouth

373
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
And fair the breast she bade me take

374
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,960
With a word that clove and clung to her

375
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,480
Burning like a furnace flake

376
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,880
But from that high uplifted bosom

377
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,600
When I touched it with my hand

378
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,700
Came the many-needled coldness

379
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,140
Of a glacier-taken land

380
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,360
And lo, the witch with eyes of amber

381
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,580
Vanished like a blown-out flame

382
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,680
Leaving but a lichen-eaten stone

383
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,340
That bore a blotted name.

384
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,620
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom real quick, you guys.

385
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,800
I'll be back in a minute.

386
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,940
Oh, there he goes.

387
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,800
You know, when you get old,

388
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,300
it kind of comes with the territory.

389
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,740
But the Reverend Stang will be back in...

390
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,680
We are all prostrate before the prostate.

391
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,860
...in two shakes of a fish's tail,

392
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,520
ere the leviathan can swim a league.

393
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
But, no, I can speak from personal experience

394
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,440
that the bosom of a witch is actually quite warm.

395
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,080
Hmm. Well, it's all relative.

396
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,380
Warm, cold, depends on where you stand in this interview.

397
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,140
I refuse to answer on the grounds

398
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,960
that it may tend to incriminate me.

399
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,440
Very well.

400
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,640
Or the witch.

401
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
But which witch?

402
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
Why not both?

403
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,980
Who what's it and which?

404
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,940
Yes, exactly.

405
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,200
But then there's the gravedigger's ass,

406
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,140
which is, in fact, cold.

407
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,540
But only the ones that work during the winter.

408
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,980
Right. Well, no...

409
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,180
It's cold in the ground.

410
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,200
When they come home and take a hot bath,

411
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,640
they're pretty much like everybody else,

412
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,840
but a little colder, maybe.

413
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,180
You've got to be kind of a cold person to...

414
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,000
The heat is not...

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,700
I have never frozen my ass off.

416
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,500
Like, of all the body parts that get cold

417
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
if I'm walking through the snow,

418
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,900
I have to say that the buttocks are the last part.

419
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,220
I don't think I've ever felt cold in that part of my body.

420
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,480
Yeah, a frostbite would be bad there.

421
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
It is the largest muscle in the body.

422
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,380
Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,920
Well, you tend to...

424
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,500
With things that are frostbitten,

425
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,740
you tend to lose, too.

426
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,460
Oh, yeah.

427
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,180
So...

428
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I lost my ass on Mount Everest.

429
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,980
Here, you want to see?

430
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,500
Not a pretty sight.

431
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,600
And Voltaire's Candide,

432
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,160
you remember the old woman with only one buttock

433
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
because the bad guys cut it off.

434
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,980
Was that before or after they ate Dr. Pangloss?

435
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, I thought it was way before.

436
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,940
Because I haven't read Candide in, like, 20 years.

437
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,980
But I actually stopped reading after the point

438
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,940
where Dr. Pangloss got cannibalized.

439
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,280
Or was that cannibalism?

440
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,520
Well, Candide makes it in the end, though.

441
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,520
He gets to go home and tend his...

442
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,340
Spoiler alert. Thank you.

443
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,300
Voltaire wrote another one called Micromigas

444
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,940
about giant, many-mile-high beings from Jupiter.

445
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,660
Or was it Saturn who visit the Earth

446
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,920
and try to find out if there's any chance

447
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,340
of any intelligence there at all?

448
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
You know, viewing the human-like bacteria,

449
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,220
you can't find any smarts like they've got

450
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,800
on their gas giant planets.

451
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,180
That's gonna have to spray for humans.

452
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
Psssh!

453
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,460
That's X-Day in a sentence.

454
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,520
They're gonna spray for humans.

455
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Don't forget to shake the can.

456
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,220
To the excess, we are like the stuff

457
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,160
that grows on the edges of our sinks.

458
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,560
The bathtub fungus.

459
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,920
That we've smashed down with Clorox

460
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,600
every month or so.

461
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,320
They barely notice us except as kind of a grease.

462
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,400
Well, kind of them to notice us at all, isn't it?

463
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,360
Well, like I say, they're gonna apply the Clorox

464
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,940
in about seven days.

465
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,200
I believe it was the astronomer from...

466
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,500
Fred Hoyle who said,

467
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,800
if a beetle by your foot says,

468
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
would you mind not stepping on me,

469
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
you'd probably pay attention to it.

470
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,500
That's profound.

471
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,360
Some people would stomp on it

472
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
just because they're contrary.

473
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,880
But we're hoping that the X-ists

474
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,800
are a more enlightened turn of consciousness.

475
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,100
Oh, Bob, we don't have to worry about that

476
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,440
because we all have those membership cards in our house.

477
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,600
Well, they made their deal with Dobbs, of course.

478
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,360
Talk about the art of the deal.

479
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,000
This is all over and done with, sold.

480
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,960
Yeah, it was a contract.

481
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,960
Aliens wouldn't break a contract or anything.

482
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,260
Yes, well, we've seen the human intelligible part

483
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,780
of the contract, but how about the alien part?

484
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,800
Well, this is the one part where we have to question,

485
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,140
you know, do you really have faith in Bob or not?

486
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,220
Because we know Bob is the greatest salesman who ever was,

487
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,340
and it is written that he will fast-forward,

488
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,900
and he will talk the aliens and the gods themselves into sparing us.

489
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,660
Well, whatever happens, Bob is going to be all right.

490
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,440
Exactly.

491
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,840
We don't know if we can really trust him or not

492
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,240
because we know he's always...

493
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,500
Hey, why don't we take a caller here?

494
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,700
All right, let's bring that caller.

495
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,640
Hello, you're on the radio.

496
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,560
You are on the radio.

497
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:54,860
Hello.

498
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,360
Well, there he is.

499
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,720
He's right there.

500
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,020
This is Reverend Bitwise Byte Foolish of Urbana, Illinois.

501
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,860
How are you this evening?

502
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,120
Hello, Reverend Bitwise.

503
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,460
This is Dr. Hal.

504
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,860
Happy to talk to you.

505
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,540
Hi, Reverend Bitwise.

506
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Can you hear me all right?

507
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,780
I have a fancy pair of Bluetooth headphones,

508
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,540
but I don't trust them entirely.

509
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,500
Yeah, we can hear you.

510
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Oh, yeah, those Bluetooth...

511
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
Loud and clear.

512
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,440
The best thing about Bluetooth is they finally found a way

513
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,980
to make cell phones sound even worse.

514
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,480
They have gotten...

515
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,120
It is a lot worse these days than the old days of the line,

516
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,160
you know, your landline.

517
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,600
Of course, the landline would never fade out.

518
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,960
Can you imagine the slogan,

519
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,160
Can you hear me now?

520
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
for the old bell telephone system?

521
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,480
You'd be laughed off the TV.

522
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,820
Right, and not only that,

523
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,780
but all the neighbors could hear you, too.

524
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,340
Yes, the party line.

525
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,280
While you and your friend were yak, yak, yakkin' on the party line,

526
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,880
a baby died, and it's your fault.

527
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,360
Oh, no.

528
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,680
Hey, I have to...

529
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,740
I have to take a second here to say hello or ni hao

531
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,300
to our listener in Hunan.

532
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,140
Oh, in the Hunan area.

533
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,420
Hunan province?

534
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,640
Yes, indeed.

535
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,720
Boy, what good food they have there.

536
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Well, you know, here's the funny thing.

537
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,900
People spoof their IP addresses all the time,

538
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,260
and I never know if...

539
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,700
Hot and sour chicken?

540
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,320
...if we're actually getting listeners from these places around the world.

541
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,640
I like to pretend that we are, but...

542
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,420
Which province is Shanghai?

543
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,180
Shanghai is...

544
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,600
You know what?

545
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,760
I don't know the name of that province.

546
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,140
Guangxi?

547
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,040
No, like Guangxi and Guangdong,

548
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,340
like, that's way down south.

549
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,340
No, no, I don't think so.

550
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,800
Because there's a subgenius there,

551
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,220
an American ex-pat in Shanghai,

552
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

553
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,100
Reverend Shining Path of Least Resistance.

554
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,980
He's there right now.

555
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,380
Who has actually run some devival.

556
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,020
He has ex-day parties there.

557
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,080
They prepare for ex-day in China.

558
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,860
Yes, it's caused a regrettable international incident.

559
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,720
Shanghai is not in a province.

560
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,360
It is its own special administrative district.

561
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,860
What a wide-open city it is.

562
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,080
Not an autonomous zone.

563
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,000
Not an autonomous zone.

564
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,720
Um...

565
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,200
I used to know a lot of the provinces of China, but...

566
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
I have a good friend.

567
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,440
His name's Bob.

568
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,760
He was in Shanghai when it was bombed by the Japanese in the 1920s.

569
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,080
One of his youthful memories.

570
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,500
In the 1920s?

571
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,060
Yeah.

572
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,400
Who was doing the bombing?

573
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,280
Was it the warlords or was it the Japanese?

574
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,100
It was the Japanese at that time.

575
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,680
See, I've always said that World War II really started in Asia.

576
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,840
Well, it started...

577
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,440
It was on the way.

578
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,120
You could tell in the 1920s.

579
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,440
The war clouds were gathering all over the place.

580
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,180
There was the Spanish Civil War, too.

581
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,560
There was colonial unrest, and it was bound to come to a head.

582
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,260
And so it did.

583
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,980
The worst thing ever that happened up till then.

584
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,280
I was watching a documentary about Tiananmen Square earlier in the week.

585
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,820
Tiananmen Square.

586
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,360
The 30th anniversary.

587
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes.

588
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,000
And I was thinking of a cohort.

589
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,100
Yes.

590
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,960
A worker of mine.

591
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,760
I work at a software company which has the habit of exploiting a lot of young Chinese

592
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,380
workers on H1B visas.

593
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,220
And she's actually headed back to China to visit her family and renew her visa.

594
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,020
And I was thinking to myself, I wonder if she has ever, during the time that she's been

595
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,340
here, sought out any information.

596
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,600
Now she's in a place where she can actually get it.

597
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,040
Or whether the policeman that's in her head is so strong that it genuinely never occurs

598
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,180
to her to look for it.

599
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,080
Oh, that's a good question.

600
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,240
I don't know.

601
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,160
The Tiananmen Square massacre happened to have happened, this is surely a coincidence.

602
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,580
30 years ago this year.

603
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:53,160
Three years to the day after I left a copy of the book of the subgenius in Tiananmen

604
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Square with my friend Li Li Jing.

605
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,220
Yeah, I believe that's called Tiananmen Square.

606
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,720
Yeah, Tiananmen Square.

607
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,380
It's pronounced Tiananmen.

608
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,580
Tiananmen.

609
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,660
Under the giant Mao painting.

610
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:15,560
And I handed, we were going to leave China the next day, and I handed Li Jing a book,

611
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,340
the one copy of the book that I'd brought.

612
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,040
And we hugged and got all teary-eyed, actually.

613
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,320
Oh.

614
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,060
Yeah.

615
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,960
And I used him as the character in my story, Three-Fisted Tales of Bob.

616
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,140
Yes, I remember that story.

617
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,420
Or The Third Fist was the story.

618
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,380
I remember that story.

619
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,660
He was the hapless striped man in what was essentially-

620
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,180
Conclude with him the story.

621
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,580
It was, actually, you know, that was a Doc Savage-inspired story.

622
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,600
It's written in the Kenneth Robeson style, as much as I could do pretty easily, because

623
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,280
I read 35 of those things as a youth.

624
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,700
Here's an update.

625
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,360
Here's an update, all right?

626
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,180
I don't know if this is a coincidence or not, but since we mentioned the forbidden words,

627
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,060
Tiananmen, the listener in China is gone.

628
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,120
Oh, well, I see that's what happened.

629
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,280
Maybe the secret police went and got this guy just because they're listening to his

630
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,360
computer, and we're now responsible for someone being a political prisoner in China.

631
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,420
He probably lost all of his good citizen points and now can't get work.

632
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,360
He didn't say a damn thing about it.

633
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,740
It was us, us yammering and yammering.

634
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,820
That's all our fault.

635
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,480
The damn Yankees, getting them in trouble all over again.

636
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,160
As I recall, I read a story.

637
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,900
We would see.

638
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,520
Well, we wouldn't have known whether to believe it, but they've taken the monitoring of voice

639
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,480
communications over the phone offline because it's not useful anymore within the US.

640
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,160
You remember there were stories after September 11th where they were wiring into the buildings

641
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,120
there in San Francisco and tapping directly into those.

642
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,480
But people have shifted so much to text-based communication that they've made it a hell

643
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,140
of a lot easier for all of the automated communication.

644
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,400
They've got no-no machines to kick on.

645
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,140
They don't even need to go to the trouble of transcribing what people are saying now.

646
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,440
This is why I never talk about anything even remotely unsavory in a text message.

647
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,940
If you've ever gotten a text message from me, you will find it to be almost robotic-looking,

648
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,960
and that's just because of my paranoia.

649
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,960
A common safety precaution.

650
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,840
Well, you don't really have to use words anymore.

651
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,880
You just use a series of pictos, those little emojis.

652
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,700
That's after my time.

653
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't think I have to use words anymore.

654
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


655
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


656
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


657
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


658
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


659
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


660
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


661
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,120


662
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,400
I am never going to be an emoji guy.

663
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,580
Now these emojis are in the Oxford English Dictionary.

664
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
I've got customs.

665
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,400
These goofy little faces.

666
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,580
I remember when they were called emoticons.

667
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,500
Yes.

668
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
And then for some reason we adopted the Japanese name for them.

669
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,020
I guess we know who really won the war now.

670
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,640
Yes, it was Pikachu.

671
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,520
I have thousands.

672
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,000
I know who he is.

673
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,740
We have thousands of...

674
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,680
Gesundheit.

675
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,980
Forget it.

676
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,060
We have a replica Pikachu now.

677
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,800
Thousands of emojis, you say?

678
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,100
I can't say.

679
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,000
I can't say.

680
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,120
He's a real emoji.

681
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


682
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


683
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


684
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


685
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


686
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


687
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120


688
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,680
I have emojis.

689
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

690
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,980
I have stag emojis that look like me.

691
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,300
Stag emojis.

692
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,560
Yeah, you can get a little set of...

693
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm pure.

694
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,420
You design your own little character that looks...

695
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,260
It's a bit limited, but Philo will send me pictures of a Philo emoji.

696
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,820
I'm pure green jelly over that.

697
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,260
Yeah, what you up to?

698
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,240
They all have...

699
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
There's a million little messages.

700
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,120
I don't have emojis.

701
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:28,860
Happy birthday.

702
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,120
Well...

703
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,640
I don't download apps.

704
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,900
I don't have one of those phones.

705
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,540
I probably do.

706
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,680
When I visit Robin Renee, she's always showing me that there's some little invisible cute

707
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,600
creature near me somewhere.

708
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,320
Oh, yeah, I can show you some cute creatures.

709
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,640
Yeah.

710
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,900
Some places.

711
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,340
They're not everywhere.

712
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,960
If you only knew.

713
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,180
You might want to mind your peas and kill...

714
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,060
She captures him, right, by hitting him with a little red ball?

715
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,160
Yes, she does all that stuff.

716
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,360
Yeah, it's very confusing.

717
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,960
There's one on the end of the table.

718
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,100
Oh, yeah.

719
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,280
Oh, yeah.

720
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,040
I'm running by the...

721
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,100
All right.

722
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,100


723
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,280
All right.

724
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,440
I want to take a minute.

725
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,200
I want to take a minute.

726
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,460
All right?

727
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:11,700
There are certain things where certain countries around the world and certain regions of different

728
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,220
countries, there's always that one thing they're never going to live down.

729
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,040
All right?

730
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,300
Like Germany, for example.

731
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,200
All right?

732
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Forget about Beethoven.

733
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,840
Forget about Immanuel Kant.

734
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,060
Forget about Einstein.

735
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,860
Remember that time you tried to kill everybody?

736
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,100
All right?

737
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,800
And France, forget about their conquest of half of Africa.

738
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,560
Forget about Napoleon.

739
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,380
Remember that time you rolled over for the Nazis?

740
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
Oh, the South.

741
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh, yeah.

742
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,620
Forget about the blues and all the good cooking that you got done.

743
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
Remember that time you tried to start your own country just to enslave people?

744
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,540
And then Japan.

745
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,960
They'll never live down Pikachu.

746
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,080
Aren't we all equally guilty in these examples of human folly?

747
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,700
They will...

748
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,260
Japan will never live down Pikachu.

749
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,980
Well, they'll just have to come up with something even less appropriate.

750
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,780
And I think that may be a done deal already.

751
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm waiting for Grand Theft Auto Go.

752
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,500
I wish they would make a Grand Theft Auto game based in the Rust Belt.

753
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,860
Like San Andreas had three different cities in it.

754
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,020
Like I think it would be awesome to have one that's like Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago

755
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,180
as the three cities.

756
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,680
I mean, each of those three cities had...

757
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,880
It has its own unique criminal culture.

758
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,600
Cleveland's flats and St. Louis' Clever Alley, Boston's North End.

759
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,820
The roster of infamy is infinite.

760
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,260
Glenn Rose talks to us.

761
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,480
Certainly the last time I was there, you could have blasted down Euclid Avenue in Cleveland

762
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,720
at 80 miles an hour on a Sunday afternoon and no one would have noticed at all.

763
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
Well, you can't do that anymore.

764
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,400
We've gentrified Euclid Avenue a bit.

765
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,060
They've cleaned up this town, mister.

766
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Hello, you're on the radio.

767
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,200
Well, that's the thing.

768
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm sorry.

769
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,940
I'm sorry.

770
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,380
I'm sorry.

771
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,920
Welcome back, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

772
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,920
He's back.

773
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,880
They're coming back, so I have to do this.

774
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,200
Yeah.

775
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,880
The baby of my aunt is on the table of my uncle.

776
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,520
Well, then how, doctor, how would you retell the story, the joke better known as the aristocrat?

777
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,440
What would your way, what would you emphasize?

778
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,200
Well, yeah.

779
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,020
That seemed like a jungle of filth and imbecility which never made me laugh.

780
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:37,040
You see, a joke has to be funny to me before I can improve on it, so I never did like it.

781
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,340
I have failings.

782
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,000
That's one of them.

783
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,840
Oh, you haven't seen Penn & Teller's movie about the joke.

784
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,140
I have.

785
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,280
Oh, you have the 90-minute movie about the joke?

786
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,280


787
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,160
See, I never saw the movie about the joke.

788
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,020
I didn't care for that either.

789
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,820
I never saw the movie about the joke.

790
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,080
And, of course, when I first heard about the joke, the punchline was spoiled.

791
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,820
Yes, well, that's the idea.

792
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,140
But, okay, so, but what I'm saying is a few years later, I heard Gilbert Gottfried's version of it.

793
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,440
Yeah, that's a good one.

794
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,280
And that was, that was actually, like, for some reason, it's just something about his voice.

795
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,660
Like, I found it hilarious.

796
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:24,000
What it took me back to was elementary school days when kids would tell these deliberately bizarre, baroque, obscene stories about matters with which they had no experience.

797
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,100
And this sounds like one of those.

798
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,260
It sounds like a regression to the playground.

799
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,220
Are you trying to tell me that none of the members...

800
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,320
This is an anti-aristocrats, anti-monarchist statement.

801
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,420
Oh, I see.

802
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,920
It's like, you know, what do you call yourselves?

803
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,400
And there they are, they're, you know...

804
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,080
So, if they're the aristocrats, where are the peasantry?

805
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,460
Even worse, is that the idea?

806
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,080
No, the idea is that the...

807
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,840
Yeah.

808
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,760
You know.

809
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,040
You don't even have to explain this to me.

810
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,780
But the opposite attack in that movie was even more effective.

811
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,060
Do you remember Silverman's version of the joke?

812
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,800
Yes, I remember her entire section in the movie.

813
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,120
That was extraordinary.

814
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,980
That was just not...

815
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,200
She's really mellowed out.

816
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,360
...talking about things they don't, you know...

817
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Yeah, she's done a bunch of movies.

818
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,640
She's not nearly as filthy as she is anymore, as she used to be, I mean.

819
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:24,060
She used to rub her fruiting cangus around the different places she did Conscious, and they said they had to call security numerous times on her for a disincentive.

820
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,940
I've taken that joke many times now.

821
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:24,940


822
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,700
I don't remember library vieläping.

823
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,400
Yeah, but...

824
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,680
...they went on a trial, the philosophy on frail devils taking matters on the phone was possible.

825
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:39,320
You know, I don't...

826
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,220
Taken away nine times since that game.

827
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,660
Oh, Tom Hager was...

828
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,700
Yeah, somewhere...

829
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,020
In a paybook, John Gregory was finding easier to sell

830
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,640
that they don't sell to any of our dear gentlemen.

831
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,060
All the hackers and all that stuff, they're just using their guns to kill tomorrow's masters.

832
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:53,880
What's the number?

833
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,280
The Yinsers.

834
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,160
So-called Collingwood accent or Collingwood accent in Cleveland.

835
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:07,060
And another accent called the Northern, the Great Lakes accent that can be heard all the way from Rochester all the way to Chicago.

836
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,320
Jack Benny's Rochester?

837
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,060
It's a little different once you get that far north.

838
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,200
You know, there's the Midwestern accent that lies over all.

839
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,520
For example, you would say you're going to wash your leg and so forth.

840
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,360
What do you mean?

841
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
I don't get it.

842
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,760
Wash or wash for wash.

843
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,340
Wash your windows.

844
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,040
Leg for leg.

845
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,240
Egg for egg.

846
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,460
Anyway.

847
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That varies.

848
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,540
You understand how there are like so many.

849
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,920
Did you grow up in California?

850
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,980
No, sir.

851
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,460
I grew up in Illinois, the sucker state.

852
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:41,900
Okay.

853
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,560
Well, that's true from Illinois where you're speaking there because that has both the Northern and the Great Lakes accents.

854
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,980
And next to it, the Hoosier state, Indiana.

855
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,300
People say carries.

856
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,340
And, you know, they do.

857
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,220
Like in the Western Pennsylvania.

858
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,440
You know, not so much when you get to the Buckeye state, which is the crossroads of every classic Chicago accent.

859
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,280
Chicago.

860
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,620
Chicago.

861
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,420
Chicago.

862
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,320
Yeah.

863
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,400
And so forth.

864
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,580
And he was right about that, too.

865
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,760
You had to shoot yourself because who else would take you?

866
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,300
I mean, well, I think it's a line.

867
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
Well, he'll work.

868
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,260
You have to front, you know, all the different mail order devices left behind, you know, and just get on the Internet.

869
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,620
And all of a sudden there's a pop up that says, vote for me.

870
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,800
And you do usually.

871
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,920
I mean, I don't mean you vote for me, but you usually perform the act.

872
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,940
I never voted.

873
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,720
I never voted for you, Dave.

874
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
I'd vote for you, Dave.

875
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,140
I never saw you on the ballot.

876
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,480
You could be a write-in.

877
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,820
A write-in candidate.

878
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,860
Oh, my God.

879
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,260
There's one of those creatures in here.

880
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,300
Pardon me for interrupting you.

881
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,720
You can't see it.

882
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,120
Only I can see it with my special visor.

883
00:36:51,120 --> 00:37:00,260
Well, it's somewhat uneasy making to know that there are all these cartoony monsters within reach of our arms.

884
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,980
It's an alien haunted station.

885
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,300
It's everywhere.

886
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,900
Speaking of stations, portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

887
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,840
Therefore, WCSB advises the discretion.

888
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:18,000
The views and opinions expressed in the program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University or anybody with their head screwed on straight for that matter.

889
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,300
This is a very special episode of Synesthesia.

890
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,100
Thank you.

891
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


892
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


893
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


894
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


895
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


896
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


897
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


898
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


899
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


900
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


901
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,100
We have very special guests in the studio here.

902
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,360
Dr. Howland Owl.

903
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,740
Hello.

904
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,660
Reverend Ivan Stang.

905
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,780
Princess We Are Do.

906
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,300
Hi.

907
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,640
And by the way, Dr. Howl.

908
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,420
Yes?

909
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,660
Did you know my brother-in-law does an impression of you?

910
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,020
He does?

911
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,240
Yes, he does.

912
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,300
You know, it's funny because my...

913
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,320
I was going to say Lonesome Cowboy.

914
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,860
Dave was in the house, too, as well as Reverend Ivan Stang, whose names you admitted earlier.

915
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes, Dave.

916
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,200
Thank you.

917
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,380
You are on the line.

918
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm not necessarily on that perpendicular.

919
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,100
Argon, you're still on the line.

920
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,780
Speaking of, but in a land where false rumors are lies and not all things are considered,

921
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,960
I'm your best choice for this.

922
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,580
See, Dave, don't compare yourself to Argon, all right?

923
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,140
You may be noble and you may be full of gas, but Argon is the most abundant of the noble gases.

924
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,500
I think you're more like Radon.

925
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,540
How about Krypton?

926
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,020
Well, that makes perfect sense to me.

927
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,220
I don't mind being a common Radon, Pervon, G...

928
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,580
Noble gases are in their own column.

929
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,960
What would be required for...

930
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave mitigation as a requirement of buying any house he had been in.

931
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,420
That would be either a cause or an effect or some problem, like, say, with sewage, I would probably assume.

932
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,540
Well, you know that all goes on your permanent floating record.

933
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,820
I think I need to take off, but I wish you all a very happy X-Day.

934
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:46,680
I wish I could come out and join you some week, but families and jobs and such have gotten in the way so far.

935
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,100
Well, if you're paid up, we can come and get you when the apocalypse happens.

936
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,860
Yes.

937
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,920
Thanks for coming, Dave Ryan.

938
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,820
Call anytime.

939
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
Oh, he's gone.

940
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,420
So anyway...

941
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,020
But you were about to ask something about old Johnny Appleseed, weren't you, Stan?

942
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,940
You were going to talk about that guy.

943
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Actually, I was going to ask, if Johnny Appleseed was woke, somebody said they didn't think I was very woke.

944
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,080
I thought, well, doesn't that mean I'm not a pink?

945
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:19,860
Yeah.

946
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,420
Yeah.

947
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:33,400
You see, that means they don't know from pink, but they want you to be all into their new agenda of sexual and various types of liberation.

948
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,500
Can I say something real quick here?

949
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,060
Sure.

950
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,820
The very word woke itself, I think, is...

951
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,580
Wacht auf.

952
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,040
Yeah.

953
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,000
Despertado.

954
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,460
People...

955
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,460
Oh, you ever see the Spanish version of Awake magazine that the Jehovah's Witness put out?

956
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,860
Yes, they're always selling it in my neighborhood.

957
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,200
Yeah.

958
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,760
They have the Spanish version, too.

959
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,880
The Watchtower, also known as...

960
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:56,980
Despierta.

961
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,240
Yes.

962
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,140
To me...

963
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:12,960
Anyway, so woke, okay, I think this is an example of the younger generation not having had very good education in terms of how the English language works and how you can make the most out of it.

964
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,440
And I know this because I grew up in a time when the language was beginning to differ.

965
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,180
And also then as a residents establish it, how the German language got folded, how the French had organized this language.

966
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:22,980
But...

967
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,140
There's a flip side.

968
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,140


969
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,940
We're in our freedom, as a 저!!!!!!

970
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:25,940


971
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,380
I mean, we're a pre-uits and we're reading ourural directors학

972
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:37,340
The reason we talk about Ordat greens Parce tes.

973
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,420
I mean, these people were, at some point...

974
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,580
carefully selected words.

975
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,320
People knew exactly what they were trying to say,

976
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,860
and they spent a long time trying to craft these specific sentences

977
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,080
and use those specific words.

978
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,280
Think of the letters home from the Civil War soldiers.

979
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,060
They were all so eloquent.

980
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,240
They sounded like poetry,

981
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,300
and it was just some G.I. Joe Yankee soldier writing home to his mom.

982
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,440
Well, no, these were high school kids I'm talking about.

983
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
These guys had not even been to the war yet.

984
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,800
You're talking about the degeneration of the ability for people to communicate in general.

985
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,000
But my definition of woke really just comes down to being aware of

986
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,000
the various forms of oppression that exist in this world.

987
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,140
Now, that would be mine, too.

988
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,640
But the way it's used, at least by people who use it in a completely sincere and non-sarcastic way.

989
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,600
But it's a bad word.

990
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,900
Well, to me it means the same thing as sheeple because it's—

991
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,480
It's lost all meaning.

992
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,200
Yeah.

993
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,160
In other words, it's pinks who are sure—

994
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,180
They're right about everything because all their friends are.

995
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,680
Sheeple is a word that's only used by sheeple.

996
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:00,240
Who are so unoriginal that that's what they call everybody else they don't like.

997
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,760
But the very fact that they use it so heavily proves that they are, in fact,

998
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,940
the very bad sheeple they're talking about.

999
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,720
And those woke—

1000
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,760
For how long it bubbled under, too, sheeple bubbled under for almost 30 years.

1001
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,520
The usage for a person who just is a follower and not a sphincter.

1002
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,620
And those individuals who describe themselves as woke

1003
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,280
are clearly not awakened to the idea of proper grammar.

1004
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:33,460
No, but they're awakened to not offending some 24-year-old writer for the Huffington Post

1005
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,080
who determines everything that is proper.

1006
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,720
Yeah.

1007
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,300
Or don't upset that one guy's girlfriend.

1008
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,480
Yeah, because she's got, well, you know, trigger issues.

1009
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,580
Yeah, so, you know, you better change everything.

1010
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,140
Can't eat a peanut.

1011
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,140


1012
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,140


1013
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,140


1014
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,140


1015
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,900
What are you doing so that you don't trigger her?

1016
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,060
You know, I've seen people with lethal peanut allergies.

1017
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,380
Mm-hmm.

1018
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,860
And it's not a pretty picture.

1019
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,240
They go into spasms.

1020
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:04,220
Look, are we sitting here to make fun of, like, how fragile and snowflakey the younger generation is?

1021
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,200
Is that our prayer for you tonight?

1022
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,040
No, but on the way here, they had to take all the peanuts off the plane that I was on.

1023
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,620
No kidding, because of one person with a peanut allergy.

1024
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,560
On the way from Cleveland Heights to the studio.

1025
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,940
But there are some people.

1026
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,720
They're very rare.

1027
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,140
They're very rare.

1028
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,600
And I think those very rare people ought to be able to have, like, a permanent tattoo.

1029
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,640
Just make sure there's no peanut oil in the ink.

1030
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,560
A big P on your forehead.

1031
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,620
They should have a tattoo, like, something to show, like, no, this person really will die if you have peanuts in the room with them.

1032
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,660
Because they're, like, one in several million.

1033
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,260
Mm-hmm.

1034
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,660
But these people actually do exist.

1035
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,740
But all these other people, they want to say that they're that allergic.

1036
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,820
Even though they're not.

1037
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,240
Yes, but...

1038
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,600
But it's a totally different phase.

1039
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,080
It's a...

1040
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,820
It's basically on Mr. Peanut.

1041
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,260
It makes Mr. Peanut look and appear much different than he really does.

1042
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,320
He's like the Grim Reaper.

1043
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,860
A sinister fellow.

1044
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,760
Yeah, like the Grim Reaper.

1045
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,060
Like that commercial.

1046
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,860
The Grim Reaper Mr. Peanut should be tattooed on their forehead.

1047
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,200
A Mr. Peanut with a hood.

1048
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,000
Instead of...

1049
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,400
No.

1050
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,260
Mr. Peanut, instead of a cane, he has a scythe.

1051
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:06,740
Yeah.

1052
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,580
Right, right.

1053
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,820
Doesn't look so spiffy now with his spats and his top hat.

1054
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,180
So you know not to serve, you know, if you see this person coming...

1055
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,900
Cocktail peanut?

1056
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,840
Never again.

1057
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,260
Now, then this raises a philosophical question.

1058
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
What's the greater offense?

1059
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,200
Like me not being able to bring my peanut butter sandwich on the airplane with me?

1060
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,760
Or that person dying?

1061
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,500
Well, if your peanut butter sandwich causes that aircraft to crash...

1062
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,580
I don't know.

1063
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,080
This is not an easy question.

1064
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,780
This question is not as easy as people like to think of it.

1065
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,640
And at the end of the day, I think it is ultimately...

1066
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,160
The responsibility of the person with a severe allergy to know that they need to navigate the world differently from everybody else.

1067
00:44:53,500 --> 00:45:02,160
But there's going to be that one time in a million where somebody with a severe lethal peanut allergy is going to have to fly somewhere for some reason.

1068
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,400
Why don't they take some special stuff they can inject themselves with?

1069
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,520
So just like bring the EpiPen with them, which would cost how many thousands of dollars now thanks to the pharmaceutical companies?

1070
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,120
Just hire a private jet, you know, like I do.

1071
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,840
Yeah.

1072
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,000
Right.

1073
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,200
I mean...

1074
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,800
Sure.

1075
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:24,240
Just me personally, like I'm willing to give up one little thing here or one little thing there if it makes the difference between life and death for another person.

1076
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,020
If they can't afford it...

1077
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,820
You can go on that plane and eat no peanuts and then get off that plane and you can wallow in peanuts.

1078
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:37,340
There are people who will actually like go into anaphylactic shock if there's a peanut like, you know, a hundred feet away from them.

1079
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,100
Even a picture of a peanut, yes, can cause a peanut.

1080
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,900
That happened to a friend of mine.

1081
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,580
You're being a little callous about this, I think.

1082
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,480
No, this is what I hear.

1083
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,220
No, they...

1084
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,080
Let them eat peanuts.

1085
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:57,320
I mean, I've heard of more, you know, I've heard of more ridiculous claims that had scientific merit or lack thereof, I should say.

1086
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,640
Well, I never heard of these fellas a long time ago, but now they're everywhere.

1087
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,860
These peanut intolerant people.

1088
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:14,840
And remember all those Walt Disney Chip and Dale cartoons where for that pair, a peanut was the most exquisite thing that could possibly be imagined.

1089
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,320
They're always trying to get a peanut away from Donald Duck.

1090
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,600
Yeah, but walnuts are richer.

1091
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:18,920
Yes, I know.

1092
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,200
It's not nutrition.

1093
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,440
It's the quest for the Holy Grail.

1094
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,580
It's like gluten-free beer.

1095
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,460
People drink three times as much beer and it's just the same old beer.

1096
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,220
It gets you drunk.

1097
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,600
Well, most of the people...

1098
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,000
Because you don't get gluten-free.

1099
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,620
Most of the people who go gluten-free don't even know what gluten is.

1100
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,220
Well, it's everything bad.

1101
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,100
It is a lectin, a vegetable protein.

1102
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,880
It's like the Communist Party of America.

1103
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,820
It's like the CPSU, the Unaligned Soviet Union.

1104
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820


1105
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820


1106
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820


1107
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,220
It's gluten-free.

1108
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,540
Never mind.

1109
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,820
Gluten-free.

1110
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,420
Well, this is the only...

1111
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,920
I really feel sorry for Catholics with celiac.

1112
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,440
The body of Christ will give them horrible cramps.

1113
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,300
Saints of celiac.

1114
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,500
Possibly even bloody diarrhea.

1115
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,260
It's unfortunate, but...

1116
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,120
Oh, God.

1117
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,940
I've been making that joke for years and you know who stole that joke from me?

1118
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:05,320
No.

1119
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,900
David Cross stole that joke from me.

1120
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,280
Not that he ever heard my joke.

1121
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:09,800
Wow.

1122
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,040
The same guy with the green...

1123
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,320
That no good son of a...

1124
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:11,700
Oh, man.

1125
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,080
High profile steal there.

1126
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,560
He was in a chipmunk.

1127
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,380
He was in a chipmunk movie, too.

1128
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,860
He was in two chipmunk movies.

1129
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,160
So, go figure.

1130
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,000
Indubitably.

1131
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,460
Someone has to hang out with Alvin and Simon and so forth.

1132
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,220
Yeah, but you can't expect too much from them, especially when they've already been stuffed

1133
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,220
and molded so many years in advance.

1134
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,980
That's all they got to do to some of those people, is put them in a small confined place

1135
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,400
and just leave them there for a couple thousand years.

1136
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,100
With a bag of peanuts?

1137
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,720
That sounds unnecessarily vicious.

1138
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,880
I would say divide the room and do an experiment.

1139
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,860
The ones who ate the most peanuts, I'd have them describe their illnesses and so forth.

1140
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,720
The other ones, I'd have them...

1141
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,260
I'd give them the reins to the kingdom.

1142
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:08,380
If this is your affliction, and I'm speaking seriously, you can't eat any peanut, let alone a bag of peanuts.

1143
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,580
I'm not afflicting...

1144
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,420
You can't even breathe the same air that a peanut is...

1145
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,420
sassing you in.

1146
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,900
So, you know...

1147
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,980
No Thai food for you.

1148
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,060
That's true.

1149
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:29,800
No peanut sauce salad, no George Washington Carver special crunchy style plain or peanut M&M's.

1150
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,580
You can't even listen to that song.

1151
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,660
Peanut, peanut butter...

1152
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,640
You can't even listen to that song.

1153
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:34,900
Right, yeah.

1154
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,420
Yeah, that Spanish song, peanut...

1155
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,960
In Cuba, each merry may...

1156
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,800
Wait a minute.

1157
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,280
Wait up to this serenade.

1158
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,980
Money, I say, come get them hot money, I said a lot.

1159
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,560
If there has to be a Mario...

1160
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,780
If you do not have bananas, don't be blue, peanuts in a little bag are waiting for you.

1161
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,800
Peanuts, peanuts...

1162
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,160
I can't believe that you guys all knew that song.

1163
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,260
Oh yeah, I was taught that song in elementary school.

1164
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,080
As was I!

1165
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,260
Everybody ate peanuts back then.

1166
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,860
Decades later.

1167
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,780
There was none of this lily-livered, lally-gagging, eat a peanut.

1168
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,580
Are you suggesting that maybe we make a eugenic argument?

1169
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,100
That maybe we should put peanuts everywhere

1170
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,380
just to put those peanut allergies out of the gene pool?

1171
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,820
If only the little ones were allowed to play outside in the dirt

1172
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,820
the way they used to be.

1173
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,780
They would not be so vulnerable.

1174
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,880
You see, I'm right on the cusp.

1175
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,460
I'm right on the cusp of a couple generations, all right?

1176
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,500
I'm like, I don't know if I belong to Gen X or the Millennials.

1177
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,160
I really don't know.

1178
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,860
Because I was a free-range kid.

1179
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,620
And yes, I played in the dirt.

1180
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,460
And I got in fights, and I would often go out,

1181
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,240
and my parents had no idea where I was,

1182
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,860
and then I'd come back once it got dark.

1183
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,660
With a bag of peanuts.

1184
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,000
With a bag of peanuts sometimes, yes.

1185
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,240
Yeah, and your dog could just run around the neighborhood loose all day.

1186
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:56,620
Right.

1187
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,620
My dog was not allowed to run around loose.

1188
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,840
And you could get on your bicycle and pedal to the rope swing by the junkyard

1189
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,840
where you and the other kid get to swing out

1190
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,020
way over a huge pile of old, sharp, metal, broken refrigerators.

1191
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,520
Oh, yes.

1192
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,740
And we'd get on our bikes.

1193
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,560
Man, we saw rusty nails on the ground.

1194
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,700
We'd take our shoes off.

1195
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,520
That's how we were raised.

1196
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,540
That was when men were men.

1197
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,020
Sheep were scared.

1198
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,660
And life was hot and merry, and the devil took the hindmost.

1199
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,640
But not today.

1200
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,640
Construction workers left the keys in their giant construction machines.

1201
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,940
And I know because we had a lot of fun with a rock crusher one day,

1202
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,700
scaring each other who would ride the conveyor belt up.

1203
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,340
And the big thing was that we had to get to the top

1204
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,360
and hope that we'd push the stop button before they were thrown down into the dump.

1205
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,060
Hurled into the rock compactor.

1206
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,780
The grinding jaws of the machine.

1207
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,360
Yeah, if my parents could have seen me doing that,

1208
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,820
they would have hoped me good.

1209
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,660
They would have used carbide steel.

1210
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,620
They probably did similar stuff when they were...

1211
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,400
And tons and tons of carbide, these rocks as big as a house,

1212
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,640
would go through the crusher there.

1213
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,700
And guess who we had to work with?

1214
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,460
A guy they called Killer, because three people had died on his shift

1215
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,560
because of dumb things he did, like hitting the on button

1216
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,660
when it was jammed and stuff like that, when people were trying to clean it.

1217
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,820
Or just because he was there and there was the boss.

1218
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,280
Well, they were exceptionally tolerant of him to keep him in their employ.

1219
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,120
They had a fatality once every week or so.

1220
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,840
Well, nowadays it would be on YouTube the next day.

1221
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,280
If somebody would have shot it.

1222
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,480
America's wackiest home video.

1223
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,320
I've seen a video of an idiot getting his arm caught on a log

1224
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,720
and being pulled into a chipper.

1225
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,660
Just fast as hell.

1226
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,680
Just like that.

1227
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,240
It's the wood chipper challenge.

1228
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,940
All the cool kids are doing it.

1229
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,200
It's like in Fargo.

1230
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,380
There's this pink spray coming out the other end.

1231
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,580
It's not a CG.

1232
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,240
Have you heard about the cinnamon challenge?

1233
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,940
Cinnamon.

1234
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,780
Oh, yeah.

1235
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,120
The kids today, they do these challenge videos.

1236
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,240
They go viral and they're like,

1237
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,780
oh, yeah, you have to eat a whole spoonful of just plain cinnamon,

1238
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,520
which could possibly kill you if you do it wrong.

1239
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,360
But it's supposed to be good for you.

1240
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,220
Yeah.

1241
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,080
Well, in moderation.

1242
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,360
I like the nutmeg challenge a lot better.

1243
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,440
It's psychedelic.

1244
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,920
Great minds think alike.

1245
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,240
Now, we're not advocating that anybody do this but us.

1246
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,320
Does that indemnify us for the train of little bloated corpses?

1247
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,780
To that brood at turns?

1248
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,960
This feels horrible.

1249
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,320
I have been

1250
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,000
So you guys just sat in new places?

1251
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,080
Yeah, no pats.

1252
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:59,400
It is soaaa horrible.

1253
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,380
Yeah, no, no way.

1254
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:01,880
No, he still is.

1255
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:07,400
He's always aunties at some things and fans too.

1256
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:07,660
The best guy in the world street is you,

1257
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:08,800
and it's aadows.

1258
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,460
Fuck only a famous couple.

1259
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,280
PSAs back in the 60s?

1260
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,760
In Arizona, it would say,

1261
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,280
Will drugs turn you on?

1262
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,180
Will drugs turn on you?

1263
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,260
That would be on the TV every night.

1264
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,280
And I can't remember why I was even thinking of that particular...

1265
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,680
There was some PSA that I was thinking of a second ago

1266
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,160
that I suddenly lost because...

1267
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,200
Well, the weirdest one, I swear, this is true.

1268
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,260
I wasn't drunk.

1269
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,560
It's really happened.

1270
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,180
Years ago in San Francisco, in the middle of the night,

1271
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,900
all these safety PSAs came on,

1272
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,940
and there was an anti-coffee one

1273
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,400
with black people dancing, you know,

1274
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,260
turning down people dressed as huge cups of coffee.

1275
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,040
The caffeine, the cappuccino, you know,

1276
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,180
and they're dancing and...

1277
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,920
Black people discovered coffee.

1278
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,720
I know. Who made this?

1279
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,920
And it was shown.

1280
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,420
My roommate, Paul Mavridis,

1281
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,600
and I watched this thing with incredulity.

1282
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,420
It was...

1283
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,860
A PSA, an anti-coffee, anti-caffeine PSA

1284
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,100
shown late at night.

1285
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:15,860
How are the czar...

1286
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,880
Why is it black people?

1287
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,760
Those people are more susceptible.

1288
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,560
They were entertainers.

1289
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,240
They were doing the dances and...

1290
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,480
Incredulity because they know what's going on.

1291
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,540
Incredulity does know what's going on.

1292
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm just telling you, that's what it was.

1293
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,200
Who knows?

1294
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,260
Maybe these days you could look it up online.

1295
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,680
Maybe you could even find it

1296
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,500
on your computational device.

1297
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,920
Somebody might have made a little copy of that.

1298
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,620
If I found it, wouldn't I be lost?

1299
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,560
You know what I'm saying?

1300
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,320
Well, you would be wiser.

1301
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,540
Older and wiser.

1302
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,760
You'd know that not...

1303
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,320
I'd be wizened.

1304
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,440
You know, you might be at your wit's end.

1305
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,220
But, on the other hand, it might be

1306
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,420
something which opens the door to you.

1307
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,120
Anti-coffee PSA.

1308
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,980
Yep, that's what I was trying to say.

1309
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,260
Are you trying to find it?

1310
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,400
Because we did see it.

1311
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,540
It was like in the...

1312
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1313
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1314
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1315
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1316
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1317
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1318
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,400
In the late 70s or early 80s.

1319
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,800
What is this?

1320
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,380
It must have been the early 80s.

1321
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,600
It must have been after 1984.

1322
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,400
Reverend Stang has left the studio.

1323
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,140
He's racing out to try to do just what I said.

1324
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,260
To look up on the portable handheld device,

1325
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,760
see if there's this film

1326
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,300
of the 30-second anti-coffee PSA that we saw.

1327
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,980
Well, you have to understand

1328
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,760
that coffee is very important to Reverend Stang.

1329
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,760
And to me.

1330
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,560
And to society in general.

1331
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,480
I mean, that's like the...

1332
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
One drug they'll never outlaw.

1333
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,940
Except for the Mormons.

1334
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,820
How long was it?

1335
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,360
Was the anti-coffee thing going on there?

1336
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,300
It was about 28 seconds long.

1337
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,380
I only saw it once.

1338
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,040
But it was part of a raft of late night...

1339
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,440
Ooh, unzip yourself, Princess Wee.

1340
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,800
Princess Wee's getting comfortable in the studio.

1341
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,740
Hubba hubba, look at that.

1342
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,920
Well, I guess we're all kind of relaxed here.

1343
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:08,460
As we talk about PSAs for our own...

1344
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,220
Mr. Peanut.

1345
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,560
It's the most fun thing about being on the radio.

1346
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,080
You don't have to worry about being dressed or not.

1347
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,600
That's right.

1348
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,280
It's a...

1349
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm not wearing any pants!

1350
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,420
T-M-I.

1351
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,320
Uh, yes.

1352
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,460
So, uh...

1353
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,100
That goes a long way in describing

1354
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,040
what's actually going on in the back and front of your mind

1355
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,640
while you're doing any kind of radio performance.

1356
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,880
Who knows who cares...

1357
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,380
I'm not wearing any pants, you know.

1358
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,640
...who wears the pairs of dead man's pants

1359
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,740
that dance in the darkness of the sun.

1360
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,060
So...

1361
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,540
Oh, we're going to, uh,

1362
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,400
greet Reverend Stang when he comes back

1363
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,100
and find out if he found...

1364
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,980
And here he is.

1365
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,600
Did he find the PSA?

1366
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,060
No.

1367
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,600
Nope.

1368
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,740
Well, it must have been...

1369
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,120
Too obscure.

1370
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,640
It must have been after 1984.

1371
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,980
In the 80s.

1372
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,780
There were quite a few of, uh,

1373
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,960
hilarious anti-drinking PSAs.

1374
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,260
They had those, too, at the same time.

1375
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,200
But this is the only time we ever saw the anti-coffee one.

1376
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,800
I actually saw a, uh, a rerun,

1377
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,200
of that, uh, that show that was on MTV back in the 90s,

1378
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,600
The State.

1379
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:15,620
It was the sketch comedy, uh, show that they had

1380
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,380
in, like, the early, mid-90s.

1381
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,640
No, no, it was American.

1382
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,000
Uh, and, uh, yeah, they had this one sketch

1383
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,520
where they were all just, like, freaking out on coffee,

1384
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,880
and it was almost like an anti-coffee PSA.

1385
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,340
And I remember hearing...

1386
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,320
It seems like the scientific community

1387
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,400
cannot make up its mind on whether or not coffee

1388
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,940
is, uh, good for you or bad for you.

1389
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,540
And, uh, wait, you know what?

1390
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,780
Speaking of not being able to make up your mind,

1391
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,920
about what's good or bad for you,

1392
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,960
I can't decide whether this show is or not.

1393
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,740
Uh, but I do think it might be time

1394
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,080
to just pause the program for just a couple messages.

1395
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,300
Pause the refreshes.

1396
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,260
From, uh, you know, well, you know, just to, uh...

1397
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,740
Yeah, you know, just to, uh, service the public or whatever.

1398
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,260
You're pretty much...

1399
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,880
Just to, you know...

1400
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,980
Polar bears are melting.

1401
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,020
Polar bears are melting.

1402
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,060
Polar bears are melting.

1403
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,080
Ah!

1404
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,040
Polar bears are melting.

1405
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,300
Melting!

1406
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,020
Polar bears are melting.

1407
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,380
Melting!

1408
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,000
Polar bears are melting.

1409
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,120
Ah!

1410
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,040
Polar bears are melting.

1411
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,340
Ah!

1412
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,000
Polar bears are melting.

1413
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,440
Melting! Melting!

1414
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,980
Polar bears are melting.

1415
