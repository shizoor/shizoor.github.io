1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,080
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
Somehow, Bob's like it!

4
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,440
No trouble. Just get set and get going.

5
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,860
Hey, hear me. Recording. Everything's going fine. No trouble.

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,760
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,540
Bob?

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,360
Bob?

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,820
Bob?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,160
Bob?

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,440
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,240
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,720
What about slack?

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,880
That's your key phrase.

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,120
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,720
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,780
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,720
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,140
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,420
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,380
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,640
Bob Dobbs.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
Living avatar of slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,940
Insert a thumb under the upper lip.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,420
Has this ever happened to you?

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,000
Why, I should have been there, Ted. It was great.

27
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,640
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,300
Where were you that night?

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,600
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,680
I guess I should have gone, huh?

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,420
Didn't you feel stupid?

32
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,520
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,220
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,580
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,740
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time.

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,740
So turn.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,520
And make time run backwards.

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,080
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,440
How, you may ask.

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,200
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,940
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,760
Blango.

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,100
My dog was dead.

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
Was I sad?

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,220
Sad till I met Bob.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,220
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car,

47
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,980
do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,640
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,820
before he could hit old Booger.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,660
Ain't that right, fella?

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,620
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,840
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,620
Just right.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,980
Bob's School of Time Control.

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,460
The Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,300
All town, 13L.

59
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,520
Clear launch area.

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,500
Okay, launch area's clear.

61
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,220
All right, look at those.

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,100
Central control processor on.

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,200
Thank you.

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,020
Air locks closed.

65
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,540
My air lock's closed.

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
Recon vessels, well, this is base control.

67
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,420
Commence free departure, Jack Stegman.

68
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,580
Show is starting up.

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,260
Life support systems functional.

70
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,860
All right.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,780
You want to turn on the main?

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,080
All right.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,080


74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,080


75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,080


76
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,920
Show mode is on.

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:03:59,940
We're going to broadcast.

78
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,940
Oh, we're already broadcasting.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,900
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,600
Ah, yes, dear friends.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,240
Nice green lights across the board.

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,060
Yes, the show is warming up.

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
Yes, and you can see your radio light up,

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,700
and if you look inside the speakers real close,

85
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,620
you may be able to see the picture.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,140
Free departure check sequence complete.

87
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,980
Thank you.

88
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,480
Awaiting navigational input interface for base computer.

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,740
Okay, here we go.

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,020
Open phone lines tonight.

91
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,480
All right, please.

92
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Phone lines are open.

93
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,700
All right.

94
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
Energize the caller, please.

95
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,020
Ah, yes, dear friends.

96
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,640
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,280
Praise Bob.

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,340
Praise Bob.

99
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,920
And we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour,

100
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,360
carrying the message, the seed word,

101
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,080
of the faith of Bob, the faith in Bob, FIB, we call it.

102
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,120
Can you keep up the FIB, friend?

103
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,800
You want to dump the main shunts?

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,540
Thank you.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,660
All right.

106
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,940
The show is right up on the green lines, doctor.

107
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,780
The show is fully on the line.

108
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,640
We will be landing on another show.

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,020
We will be docking with another show tonight.

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,720
Pardon me.

111
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,900
You can't land.

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,320
You can't land on another show.

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,900
We'd cause a nuclear explosion.

114
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,340
And hold onto your seats and...

116
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,840
Oh!

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,940
God!

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,500
God!

119
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,480
Oh!

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Oh!

121
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,180
They pinned!

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,160
Dump him!

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,820
Dump!

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,240
Dump!

125
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,240


126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,320
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,640
Hit me!

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,220
Hit me!

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,760
Hit me!

130
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,180
Hit me!

131
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,180


132
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,180


133
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,720
Hit me!

134
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,540
Hit me!

135
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,600
Hit me!

136
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,940
We're gonna rock the world.

137
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:25,940


138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,320
R Fortunately, we got it.

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,140
D The killer вып

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,540
Did you see my ass?

141
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,060
I'm sending you out.

142
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,080


143
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,340
Day by day

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,340
If you think it's gonna get any better

145
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,520
Just keep dreaming away

146
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,160
You got to hold your head up high

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
All day and night

148
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,580
Cause you're ready

149
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,760
The only weapon you need

150
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,140
To settle up a fight

151
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,320
Go

152
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,820
No matter how much you shake and dance

153
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,420
The last few drops go down your pants

154
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,020
No matter how much you scream and shout

155
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,560
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,300
No matter how much you piss and moan

157
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,520
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

158
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,480
No matter how much you whack your head

159
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,940
You're better off living than being dead

160
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,460
Hit me

161
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,700
Society pushes harder on you every day

162
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,880
You gotta get rich to make it

163
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
You hear them say

164
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,540
You gotta get rich to make it

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,520
But you can't have your cake and eat it too

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,160
You know

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,920
There ain't enough to go around

168
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,380
And it's starting to show

169
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,840
The planet's getting fouler all the time

170
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,940
Fermenting your brain

171
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,920
Just like a grape turning to wine

172
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,960
We've got to destroy the forces

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
That are stealing your slack

174
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,660
Scare all them mothers

175
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,540
Give one to one

176
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,540


177
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,360
And make hard a tad

178
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,320
We've got to regain control of our destiny

179
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,860
Cause they want to take it away from you and me

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,100
But we've got to stop all this fighting amongst ourselves

181
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,060
Cause that just keeps them confused

182
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,480
And they think that's swell

183
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,840
Stand up for your rights

184
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,700
And soon you'll win them back

185
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,520
Or else they'll fight you back

186
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,520


187
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,920
And barbecue you while you're lying there on your back

188
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,660
Ah, then no matter how much you shake and dance

189
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,220
The last few drops go down your pants

190
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,720
No matter how much you scream and shout

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,400
Ain't nobody gonna try and help you on out

192
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,120
No matter how much you piss and moan

193
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,360
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,320
No matter how much you whack your head

195
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You're better off living than being dead

196
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,500
Hit me

197
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,460
Ow!

198
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,760
Ugh!

199
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,240
Uh!

200
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,380
I don't know.

201
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,220
I don't know.

202
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,560
I don't know.

203
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,400
Well, that was Brother Cleve Duncan.

204
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,760
Slackmaster Cleve and the Spirits.

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,400
Chris Drive doing that lovely old hymn,

206
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,860
No Matter How Much You Shake or Dance,

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,080
The Last Few Drops.

208
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,900
And you know the rest, boys.

209
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,100
Maybe you...

210
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,300
How'd these kids get into the station?

211
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,820
This is the children's mission, Doctor.

212
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,580
Yes, this is the children's hour for the Church of the Subgenius.

213
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,560
Kids for Bob.

214
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Say, kids, Tavis, come over here.

215
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,680
Tell us.

216
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,460
What do you think about Bob, Tavis?

217
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,420
Nothing.

218
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,880
A wise answer.

219
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,260
There is wisdom.

220
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,580
Subgenius.

221
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,600
I know about him, about spaceships.

222
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,820
You know about spaceships and Bob.

223
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,480
And that's all you need to know, friends.

224
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,260
Praise Bob.

225
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,420
Bob and the spaceships.

226
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:15,820
Ah.

227
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,880
Ah, thank you.

228
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Bob was a regular joke.

229
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,860
Bob was a robot.

230
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,720
Kid over night.

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
Got three times his battery.

232
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,340
I didn't talk to him.

233
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,740
He didn't talk to me.

234
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
Bob was a robot.

235
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,500
At first, they didn't take you seriously.

236
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,220
Good.

237
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,920
Then they began to be frightened.

238
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,720
Good.

239
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,340
They kept their opinions to themselves.

240
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:42,940
Good.

241
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,760
They stopped joining clubs.

242
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,360
Good.

243
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,620
They informed on their friends.

244
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,280
Good.

245
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,980
But you went on and on and on.

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,940
Now they're beginning to ask themselves,

247
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,640
maybe I'm next.

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:56,980
Next?

249
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,460
Where will it lead to?

250
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,380
Nowhere.

251
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,720
I'd talk to him.

252
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,060
Take up a copy of the book of the subgenius.

253
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,020
Book of the subgenius is right here on lovely McGraw Hill.

254
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,260
And I assume that must be Bob right there on the front.

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,440
Could very well be, Brian.

256
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,660
With the pipe in his mouth.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,300
It's certainly a marvelous and comfortable experience.

258
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,380
The publisher did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson.

259
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,420
The punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

260
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,140
Well, whatever your purpose may have been, my dear, I take great relish in savoring each separate horror.

261
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,760
This book isn't full of subliminal messages.

262
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,560
The messages are right out front as far as I could see.

263
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,000
Both, actually.

264
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,760
Both, yes.

265
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,240
Both.

266
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,620
They were subpsychic messages, too.

267
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,480
And in fact, the book actually, now most of your listeners will not believe this, but

268
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,400
the book carries a power shell that actually protects anything that it's being kept secret.

269
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,200
It's been carried in your car, your bathroom, especially your bathroom, and your whole house.

270
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,320
The conspiracy can't touch it because there's power.

271
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,720
Power in that book.

272
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,900
Power. And they're afraid of it.

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,140
In fact, in one respect, that's tough on sales because the love of Bob that's manifested in this book can injure normals and humans.

274
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,060
Your mind?

275
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,180
I can't believe it.

276
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,280


277
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,840
It's ridiculous.

278
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,780
Did you know that every picture of Bob has the power to view you?

279
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,700
Has the power to look at you and look into your very soul?

280
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,340
Gee, I don't know.

281
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,400
Every picture of Bob is not just an image, not just a meaningless, mindless graffito.

282
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh, those dots are alive.

283
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Look at you.

284
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,120
Each of those dots pulses with unfathomable radiant energy.

285
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,080
Each of those Bobs next to those toilets all over the U.S.

286
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't listen to him.

287
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,860
Don't listen to him.

288
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,980
Yes, you can find help.

289
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,180
You can be deprogrammed.

290
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,560
You can find out the truth.

291
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,580
But they beat me every day.

292
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
It's a hell of an impetus.

293
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,460
I know you're a dumbass.

294
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,840
I forced you to sleep on fire.

295
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,660
But that device.

296
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,100
It put me in that damn glass.

297
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,380
And I didn't know what was going on.

298
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,580
It's all right.

299
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,780
I used to have a house.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,380
But some geniuses came in, and they took all my furniture.

301
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,140
Sold it to buy me this neck brace.

302
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,920
And I can't take off now.

303
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,140
And they said it was a living being.

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,540
And that.

305
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,920
Oh, hell.

306
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,220
Oh, I got a.

307
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,160
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

308
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,180
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

309
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,960
Here comes the frag.

310
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,060
At each corner of the mouth, insert a thumb under the upper lip.

311
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,040
Now slide the thumb.

312
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,560
And the thumb comes along the inside of the upper lip until they are positioned just below

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,620
and to the side of each nostril.

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Those boys are shows.

315
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,080
These incredible shows.

316
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,220
Well, we're still beaming it to you.

317
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,840
100 million gigahertz of hydrogen line fusion powered radio.

318
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,520
We're stars of the stars.

319
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,580
Yes, indeed, friends.

320
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,020
We've got 143 solar systems on 11 different galactic quadrants.

321
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,320
All tuned in at this very moment.

322
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,500
We've been known to work one sidereal day for every Earth Day.

323
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,940
And you know they're slightly longer.

324
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,400
So, yes, here's part of our guest.

325
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,740
Yes, this is our.

326
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,860
This is the guest yeast for the evening.

327
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,120
He's a nice little job from Antares four and a half.

328
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,720
We picked up his signal last week and were able to tune him in.

329
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,380
And this is all he does.

330
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,000
He sits in his seat.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,840
He's a little trans dimensional box.

332
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,180
And does this this message to all of us?

333
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,480
I love you.

334
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,140
I love you.

335
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,700
I love you.

336
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
And he is an illegal.

337
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,700
I love you.

338
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,960
I love you.

339
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,660
I love you.

340
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,560
Real illegal in a real.

341
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,560
Oh, yes, dear friends.

342
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,000
Welcome back to the show.

343
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,920
The subgenius divine.

344
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,120
Well, our friends.

345
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,320
Yes, this is Dr.

346
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,580
G.

347
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,360
Gordon Gordon.

348
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,540
And Reverend Ivan Stang.

349
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,320
And we're sitting here to bring you the word of dogs.

350
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,040
And don't you feel devived now?

351
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,820
And don't be afraid.

352
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,400
It's just a little radio show.

353
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,400
And sometimes it gets scary.

354
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,100
Yeah, it's scary.

355
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,820
It's a scary show.

356
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,420
It could get scarier depending on what whatever parakeet mixes we drop in.

357
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,140
That's right.

358
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,260
But remember one thing.

359
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,500
It doesn't matter what life cycle you belong to and whether your basic metabolism is carbon,

360
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,040
silicon or plasma.

361
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,420
We're broadcasting to you because this is the first intergalactic church of dogs.

362
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,460
Yes, friends.

363
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,360
This is the church for every form of life that knows how to snicker.

364
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,320
Yes, indeed.

365
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,340
Every life form that that can enjoy and appreciate slack.

366
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,540
Dear friends.

367
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,020
Yes.

368
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,840
And the mysteries.

369
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,800
Those who appreciate the mysteries.

370
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,240
Ah, the mysteries.

371
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,720
Yes.

372
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,720
That sweet, sweet burning mystery of slack.

373
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,920
Yes.

374
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,720
And when finally they learn the answer to the mystery of why on that great day.

375
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,780
That one day the sound of the slack comes rippling.

376
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,620
This is what it sounds like, friends.

377
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,580
Listen to that slack rippling along.

378
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,160
Isn't that a lovely sound?

379
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,240
Oh, yes.

380
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Receive the splendor of that slack sound, friends.

381
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,580
Ah, yes.

382
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:03,360
Ah, doesn't it drip through your frontal lobes or depending upon your metabolism, of course,

383
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,900
sometimes your back lobes.

384
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,440
Sometimes it just runs down their spine.

385
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,940
Sometimes it just dribbles through their cells and oozes through the pores.

386
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,140
Oh, the slack.

387
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,920
But we know that somewhere out there you're listening to the sound of slack.

388
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, the slack.

389
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,520
We can't give you too much of this air slack because...

390
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Nay, nay.

391
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,840
No, no.

392
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,960
We can't let you get all hooked.

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
You'd just be sitting by your radios from now on.

394
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,020
You wouldn't be able to do anything.

395
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
Waiting until next week.

396
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,200
That's right.

397
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,040
When the subgenius hour of slack comes back.

398
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,180
Ah, but...

399
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,260
So that you can soak up some more of the healing power that can be mysteriously broadcast.

400
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,280
That's right.

401
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,540
So put your appendage, your pseudopod, your flipper, your hand, your manipulation, your

402
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,540


403
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,000
ventilator, your chela, your mandible, whatever you got, friends.

404
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:59,620
It doesn't matter if it's a scaly, horny carapace or a squamous, drooling, mollusk-like, mucus-secreting

405
00:18:59,620 --> 00:18:59,940
skin.

406
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,540
Just place your little sensory appendage upon your transmitter-receiver unit and you

407
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,420
will receive the benefit of this slack, this air slack.

408
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,520
And when finally you discover the mystery, the answer to the mystery, you'll be able

409
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:17,520


410
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,460
to see the history of the slack.

411
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:26,840
Why, on that day you will be killed and re-killed and re-killed again in the scalding and scathing

412
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
acid love of J.R. Bob Dawes.

413
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,540
Hallelujah.

414
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,300
Praise Bob.

415
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,240
E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I.

416
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,620
E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I.

417
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,820
Ah, yes, friends.

418
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, well, Dr. Stang, I think perhaps we ought to turn the slack generator down a little

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,760
bit because...

420
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,640
Let these poor...

421
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,580
Because...

422
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,740
Just soothe them out with it.

423
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,080
Don't drop them off sudden now.

424
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,600
Just there you are.

425
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Yes, friends.

426
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,260
Just a rug.

427
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,600
There.

428
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,120
A rug of slack underneath.

429
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,500
That little tiny layer that separates you from the hard, cold floor of reality.

430
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,620
Well, we'd love to get you hooked, but we wouldn't be able to supply it.

431
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,180
That's right.

432
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,280
It would be like Dawn of the Dead all over again.

433
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,020
Shambling zombies for Bob.

434
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,900
Shambling slack zombies.

435
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,400
Trying to get some more of that great stuff that they...

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,820
That beautiful, that beautiful essence.

437
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,080
That vital secretion.

438
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,060
That secretion of the heart, soul of Dobbs.

439
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,200
That one thing that he possesses more than any other entity in the universe.

440
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,440
And, friends, we're talking about slack.

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
And if you haven't...

442
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,780
Don't you wish you had it?

443
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Don't you wish you had that sound with you all the time?

444
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,320
Don't you like to wrap yourself up in that slack?

445
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,920
That big, warm, fuzzy, woolly slack and just snuggle into it and say, ah.

446
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,160
If you had just one Bob pill...

447
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,060
Like this one in this little...

448
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,140
This wild, solitary...

449
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,760
And we have one, listeners.

450
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
We have one.

451
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:00,200
And this one pill would be enough to impart into you the essence of the Stark Fist of

452
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,840
Removal.

453
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,800
You would become Vishnu the Destroyer, friends.

454
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,540
That's right.

455
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:12,120
You would dance upon the helix of the ever-changing quantum universe, shifting your eigenstata.

456
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,700
Dog said, dog said.

457
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,140
Dog said, dog said.

458
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,140


459
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,280
Dog said, dog said.

460
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,580
Dog said, dog said.

461
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,500
Dogs have always been my friend.

462
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,340
And we've had many dogs during these years.

463
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,260
Now we have Yuki.

464
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,500
And I think he, I think they say the best for the last.

465
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,100
He is the plenteous and the smartest.

466
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,100
And the most constant in his attention of all the dogs that I've known.

467
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,860
Best for the last.

468
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,280
He is the friendliest.

469
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,460
And the most honest.

470
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,620
And the most honest.

471
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,840
And the most honest.

472
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,960
He is the wanderer and adventurer too.

473
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,940
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

474
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,860
And the most honest.

475
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:04,700
And the most constant in his attention of all the dogs that I've known.

476
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,720
And the most honest.

477
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,040
And the most honest.

478
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,300
And the most honest.

479
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,740
And the most honest.

480
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,740


481
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,740


482
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,740


483
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,500
He is the lost bull.

484
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,120
And the most honest.

485
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,520
And he is the lost bull.

486
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,380
Wandered in here.

487
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,260
Jumped out of someone's car.

488
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,640
Or we have always thought maybe he was worth a circus.

489
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,580
We have been here ever since.

490
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,720
We left word that if the owner ever asked about him, to direct him here.

491
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,500
But I'm glad that the owner never missed him.

492
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,500
Because he was a great guy.

493
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,500


494
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,500


495
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,500


496
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
Because I surely would if he left me.

497
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,380
Me.

498
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,360
If you don't get some flea powder and a bath, he wants to go in the car.

499
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,300
You want to go on a ride?

500
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,520
You want to go see the cattle?

501
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
You want to go see them?

502
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,180
Will you?

503
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,740
You want to come?

504
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,180
Come on.

505
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,560
You don't get any.

506
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,380
You don't get any.

507
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,200
Get one for my son.

508
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,680
circles, circles.

509
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,060
Did someone, a big guy come from off the streets?

510
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,160
Crazy people, the movies, where does Damned?!

511
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,160


512
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,160


513
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,160


514
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,000
Take him away.

515
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,080
A grown fat driver!

516
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:55,180
Hey, hey!

517
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:12,400
Oh, yes, dear friends, that was, uh, first up there was the Summa Electric Institute.

518
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:19,980
That was Reverend Glenn Carlson of the Church of the Subgenius, with Dogs Have Always Been

519
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,820
My Friend.

520
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,780
A lovely tune, and, uh, followed by Dr. Onan Canobite, a nameless song.

521
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,840
Also using sample dog barks as, uh, and this show's going to the dogs, and once again we're

522
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,180
gonna have to switch ides and stops.

523
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
What's wrong with this microphone?

524
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,260
Thank you.

525
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,620
Hey, that new church air is just great.

526
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,300
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.

527
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Rated V.

528
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,220
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

529
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,320
Your doorbell rings, and there's a chaplain standing quietly.

530
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,300
He tells you,

531
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,540
We're splashing liberation right around the world, and we'll die to do it.

532
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,980
Tape recorders taped all over their bodies.

533
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,960
Before making any additional statements about my subject, I'd like to make it clear that

534
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,060
in any room, I'm not a doctor.

535
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


536
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


537
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


538
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


539
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


540
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


541
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


542
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


543
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


544
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


545
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,060


546
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:41,880
But there are zawsze un settlement no

547
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:51,680
page, bad names, and prepare for saying Rlichto!

548
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,120
Let's save him walt.

549
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,300
about. We're living in the closing moments of this dispensation.

550
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,000
So housewives take this tip from the growers of Idaho potatoes, whose potatoes make delicious

551
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,940
French flies.

552
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:16,760
And as we watched, my friend very suddenly and violently vomited.

553
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,640
Who's going to listen to that? And when they do, how are they going to feel? Well, I don't

554
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,860
have to think about that. You do. Whoever you are.

555
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,920
Wish you were a genius, but feel like only a sub-genius. Have a kisser Darth Vader's

556
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:47,420
mom would expunge. Tired of gorge-clogging crypto-wimpism? I have a solution. Stay tuned

557
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:53,480
in the weeks to come for exciting lectures such as Drink Your Way to Happiness and a

558
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,620
special tour of the Roy Rogers Museum of Art.

559
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:55,620


560
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,740
All this and more on your favorite soundtrack for a crumbling society, Food Fights of the

561
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,040
Gods.

562
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Oh great. Things are happening. God is showing people things. Many of you are hearing verses.

563
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,880
You're tormented. Your mind is tormented, your family. Some of you husbands and wives.

564
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,580
You mumble-gumble complain, falsify a few demon powers.

565
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,040
It's trying to destroy your marriage, your home.

566
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,760
So you need to come.

567
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,340
If you can't, man, you ought to get these tapes anyhow on Demonology.

568
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,220
Tape 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and they're on right on up till we get through.

569
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,800
And we'll be offering the tape on Can a Christian Be Demon Possessed at the end of the program.

570
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,900
But we're going to take you into that service right now.

571
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,820
We're going to take you into that service in progress.

572
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,940
What we are sharing on the subject, Can a Christian Be Demon Possessed?

573
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,380
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

574
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,980
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

575
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,880
It's called the Church of the Spirit.

576
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,660
The Church of the Subgenius.

577
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Tom Vitale has this report.

578
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,340
You will pay to know what you really think.

579
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,440
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

580
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,460
And not only have you paid to know what you really think, but once you will get value for your dollar.

581
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

582
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,980
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius.

583
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,880
As delivered by...

584
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,200
by the Pope of All New York, David Meyer at a recent revival.

585
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,220
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack,

586
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,320
how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

587
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
For they shall see God.

588
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,800
It's still true.

589
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,140
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

590
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,780
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

591
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,800
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care!

592
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,920
I don't care, don't care, don't care anymore.

593
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,540
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

594
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,020
I can't tolerate it.

595
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,200
I can't live with it.

596
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,720
I can't.

597
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,300
Praise God.

598
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,020
And that's how I became a subgenius.

599
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Children of the great Saint Lenny Bruce said,

600
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,920
American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

601
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,880
Here in the church of the subgenius we say,

602
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,540
cast off those crutches and crawl with pride.

603
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,980
You can crawl again.

604
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,520
You can crawl again, children.

605
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,500
Test, test, test, test.

606
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:55,140
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington,

607
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,760
and so forth.

608
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,020
And this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

609
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,680
We've been playing media barrage tapes on these shows

610
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,100
which are edited primarily by Puzzling Evidence

611
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,880
in Oakland, California, Dr. Byron Werner

612
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,780
in Los Angeles, California,

613
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,200
and me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

614
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,380
Of course, what I mainly do is just take the stuff

615
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,000
that people send in and rip them off to the max.

616
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,700
And now this side of the show is about to end, listener,

617
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,520
and you're gonna have to flip this show over

618
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,140
in order to hear the rest of it.

619
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,500
Praise God.

620
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,580
If you're tied up and can't get to the radio to do that,

621
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,000
why, let's just hope that you've got auto-reverse as we...

622
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Welcome back, friends, to the hour of Slack radio ministry

623
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,960
on KNON 90.9 FM.

624
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,660
This is more admirable people.

625
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,880
Let it out, let it out.

626
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,640
Aren't you worried?

627
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,460
Don't you want to get out of here?

628
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,800
Sounds like the show.

629
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,940
Yes, we dare you.

630
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,380
Try that.

631
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,300
Okay, we're gonna try it right now, Doc.

632
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:06,920
Here we go.

633
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,140
Bob hung up on us.

634
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,660
He is dead.

635
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,580
It's true.

636
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,160
Good morning, caller.

637
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,560
What happened?

638
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,440
Unimaginable.

639
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,320
Mishmash.

640
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:13,780
Unimaginable.

641
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


642
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


643
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


644
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


645
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


646
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


647
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


648
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,780


649
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,600
We're gonna cover the mandate of Bang It All.

650
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,980
No, we're not gonna cover anything.

651
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,740
Poor girl.

652
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,680
She's in a bubbling vat of jokes.

653
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,900
I'd hear your question, but we're gonna throw a tarp over it

654
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,700
and protect it from the elements.

655
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,080
Yeah, we might throw a tarp over it.

656
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,500
That's all we'll cover.

657
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,240
This young lady has the jokes.

658
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,580
All day?

659
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:27,640
All day, yeah.

660
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
He's soaking in the jokes.

661
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,280
We're gonna go to use the tarp.

662
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,980
If you come down to the station right now,

663
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
we'll cover you up with something soft and warm, too.

664
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,480
We're gonna have to reverse the charger.

665
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,140
Listen to the clock.

666
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,380
I don't like it.

667
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,080
I'm in the dark.

668
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,600
You've been in the dark a long time, Doug.

669
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,820
I do like it.

670
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
I wanna go home.

671
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,240
This is the most miserable thing I've ever seen.

672
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,120
It's joyous.

673
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Too late.

674
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,840
You joined the church of the subgenius.

675
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,800
I can't even see Mobius Rex now.

676
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,100
That's too bad, boys.

677
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,320
Now you know what subgenius hell is really like.

678
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,640
Yes.

679
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,140
Forced to do the show that's never paid.

680
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,180
Listen to that.

681
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,860
They're in hell.

682
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,140
We can view their dead souls in hell,

683
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,340
and they still can't quit doing the show.

684
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,980
I know.

685
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,600
These demons call them.

686
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,340
It's endless, endless.

687
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,400
You can't stop them.

688
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,860
You can't stop them.

689
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


690
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


691
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


692
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


693
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


694
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,600
They're gonna hang up on you.

695
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,200
They are, anyway.

696
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Or if you do, they just call back again.

697
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,360
You know, they're in the show.

698
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,960
Blivit, blivit, blivit.

699
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,960
Blivit, blavit, and bluvit.

700
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
I bet you can't say something.

701
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,600
That's right.

702
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,180
You can blub it or you can blivit.

703
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,100
I can't blab such blibber blubber.

704
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,800
My tongue is...

705
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,100
You'll have to listen very, very carefully.

706
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,260
Well, we can listen...

707
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,060
I have your son in a brown paper bag,

708
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,860
and if you don't do what I say...

709
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,420
What do you think you are, anyway?

710
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,420
...you'll be trying to convince me.

711
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,860
You'll have to listen very, very carefully.

712
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:40,860


713
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:40,860


714
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,100
You create problems that you can't possibly be able to come down with.

715
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:53,160
If my demands are not met, I will kill a policeman as a nun for a funny thing.

716
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,140
There's the little head in his little head coffin.

717
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,120
That's right.

718
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,980
And one neck bone.

719
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,300
And one neck bone.

720
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,340
And one neck bone.

721
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,280
Moving to the large pit to be buried with the rebar.

722
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,080
That doesn't count.

723
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,460
I think that they run the show, but little do they know that I've put so much of their

724
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,840
energy into the show that the show is over.

725
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:10,840


726
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,000
The show is now a great, shambling entity within itself.

727
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,160
The hideous show.

728
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,860
And they are mere organs within this great, hideous, drooling, rugose squamous sesquipedalian

729
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,980
show.

730
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,400
No kidding.

731
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,140
And our listeners of our show must suffer the same way.

732
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,920
Because it's their show that's our show.

733
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,520
That's right.

734
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,320
You can't keep track of it.

735
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,840
But it follows.

736
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:40,840


737
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,380
It follows you all the time.

738
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,880
Go ahead.

739
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,260
Try to turn it off.

740
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,400
We'll keep hearing it.

741
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,800
The endless show.

742
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,180
The show of shows.

743
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,420
Yes.

744
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,460
Hell on earth.

745
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,620
Oh yeah, you think, well it's funny, I'm on radio personality.

746
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,720
I'm just going to have me a show.

747
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,460
Yee-haw.

748
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,520
Yes sir, ee-bop.

749
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,460
And then you've been on that show, and you've been on that show, and you look at your calendar

750
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,800
watch one day and you realize that the last half an hour has taken a little over a hundred

751
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:10,840
hours.

752
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:10,840


753
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:19,540
And you begin to wonder, what is the deal with this Bob Dobbs character?

754
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
And what is this time control?

755
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,100
And these subgenius characters on their radio shows, what's this Dobbs drone signal they

756
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,900
constantly speak of?

757
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,140
Yes, what is the Dobbs drone signal?

758
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:40,820
The thing that locks into their very innermost self and draws out that which is the most

759
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,300
it desires.

760
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,060
Ah yes, dear friends, makes that gland grow.

761
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,400
And it's too late now.

762
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:56,220
Even if you unplug your radio wire, when you can't hear the show, the show can hear you.

763
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,800
This is the show that listens back, friends.

764
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,160
Face it, 1984 happened a year ago.

765
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:10,820
We were doing the implementing of the big eyes, the eye of taxis, dear friends.

766
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,320
Remember the eye of every year here in Texas.

767
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,680
The eye of taxis, it watches.

768
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,980
Ever been kicked in the taxis, my friends?

769
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,400
Anybody ever got you around?

770
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,840
You're your Blancas lately?

771
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,660
Yeah.

772
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,740
What kind of a show do you think this is?

773
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,360
Just your average little rock and roll music show?

774
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,800
Your average comedy show?

775
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
Comedy talk show?

776
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,300
Your average satire and social comment and parody show?

777
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
Ha ha ha.

778
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,960
It's a squeaky show is what it is.

779
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,360
That's right, dear friends.

780
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,380
No, the audience is not far away.

781
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,240
The minister of the world.

782
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,960
I could forget all that stuff now.

783
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,960
It wasn't important anymore.

784
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,740
The time when those who sleep are deep in their dreams.

785
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,680
Huh?

786
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,380
And the people who can't figure out why their hands are in their pants when they wake up.

787
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,840
And the mob's mom.

788
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,140
And the church of the subterranean show.

789
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,600
The doctors of the air operate without warning.

790
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,340
Yes.

791
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,620
Here they come.

792
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,000
Warning.

793
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,240
We will operate soon.

794
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,880
Warning.

795
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,300
Warning.

796
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,880
Warning.

797
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,780
We must warn you at this moment.

798
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,400
It doesn't have to be true.

799
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:30,840
It does have to be true.

800
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,600
Well, here we are again.

801
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,140
It just doesn't have to be true.

802
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,760
Because we're always here.

803
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,040
Your final instructions?

804
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,660
I may sound like a Bible beater yelling up a revival of the Bible.

805
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


806
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,080
But a river crossing can't mean it.

807
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
But that don't change the truth none.

808
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I want to see if one person, one single person, will have the courage of their convictions

810
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,660
and come down here and open up to Bob and give them, give me their wallet.

811
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,420
I don't just want your money.

812
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,740
Don't just want your credit cards.

813
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,740
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

814
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,500
Give it all up now.

815
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,320
Okay?

816
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,360
One person.

817
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,100
That's all we need.

818
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,780
Actually, Bob doesn't care.

819
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,560
Bob is the richest man on earth.

820
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,340
He doesn't care if you spend money.

821
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:14,400
Bob could give, frankly.

822
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,100
All he wants is souls.

823
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,780
He wants you to have slack.

824
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,180
He wants you to fight the conspiracy.

825
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,660
And it is going to take some fighting because they are everywhere.

826
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,520
Powerful charity.

827
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,440
The conspiracy is everywhere.

828
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:33,500
The television shows you watch the rock and roll songs that they play over and over and

829
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,560
over and over again.

830
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,000
Of course, this station excluded.

831
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,340
What do you think they're doing that for?

832
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,320
Oh, you got the present company.

833
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,900
Present company excluded.

834
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,340
But Bob, you're the richest man on earth.

835
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,340


836
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,340


837
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,340


838
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,340


839
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,420
You might look for some of that stuff on thexit.com.

840
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,260
We're not talking aboutantis ما께서 communist BTS video.

841
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,560
People are being replaced.

842
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,200
We're trying to Tacos the

843
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,100
ado to survive.

844
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,020
We're just going to watch it play into our own through and through.

845
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,020


846
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,400


847
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,780
Eh, no.

848
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:07,780


849
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,320
Robert?

850
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,340
Great.

851
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,680
full of geeks, 80,000 strong, waiting for us to come on stage and entertain them.

852
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,300
We want them to found their own church.

853
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,380
Get on the streets and entertain themselves.

854
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,120
Bob preaches short-duration personal saviors.

855
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,920
You should skip from one personal savior to the next.

856
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,980
It could be a wine bottle.

857
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,440
We live in a consumer society, ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,860
It could be a new record.

859
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,160
Planned obsolescence.

860
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,280
Things wear out fast.

861
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,120
Not our fault.

862
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,860
That's the way it is, and we understand.

863
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
Because Bob came.

864
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,500
Bob doesn't care about your sins.

865
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,220
Bob won't die for your sins, because Bob's not the son of God.

866
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,820
Bob won't die for your sins.

867
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,260
Bob won't forgive you for your sins.

868
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,820
All Bob cares about is that Bob will justify your sins.

869
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,220
He'll justify your sins and make them part of his plan.

870
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,220
The lights have gone down just slightly.

871
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,840
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.

872
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,820
Volume 1, Number 1.

873
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,280
The Mutron.

874
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,560
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

875
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,860
Outside the realm of conspiracy science, and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

876
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,020
we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

877
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,900
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy

878
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:51,460
is nothing but a complex sham, a decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex

879
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,260
and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

880
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:03,940
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws

881
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,480
or as foggy abstracts of the universe.

882
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,520
We are told about things that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids

883
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,640
to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

884
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,940
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius

885
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:25,580
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing little known works on the subject of time

886
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:32,780
and its methods of control, have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

887
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,880
This key is the Mutron.

888
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:46,760
The truth must now be told. How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book, but it's too involved to be told here.

889
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,560
The actual issue at hand is the neutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

890
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:00,140
In order to properly understand the following, it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

891
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:12,000
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite, thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

892
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:25,180
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc., acting in concert make up the yakutismic field, which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

893
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,720
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle.

894
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,640
It is commonly called a black hole.

895
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:40,000
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space, but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

896
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:46,040
They often have event horizons many miles wide, beyond which not even light can escape.

897
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,600
The third fundamental particle is the neutron.

898
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,220
The neutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality

899
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,340
of the passage through time of anything it touches.

900
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,560
The neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

901
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:15,880
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous concentration of neutron phenomena.

902
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:25,280
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications of the neutron in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

903
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,200
The second will concern the incredible potentialities of the neutron.

904
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,720
The third will concern the incredible potentialities of using the potent forces of the neutron in time control research and in practical time control.

905
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,900
Section A.

906
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,160
Just how f***ing big everything really is.

907
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:49,080
What we know as the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus

908
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:57,460
and the neutron or mutrons acting as the electron cloud with the electrons providing the energy for the neutron to drive us forward through time.

909
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,200
Just about everything in the universe is a giant atom.

910
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,200


911
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,300
Everything else in the universe is just so much debris cluttering up the works of things.

912
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,180
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.

913
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:18,060
The neutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards

914
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,620
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

915
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,100
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal mutrons impinging on our universe

916
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,740
at a different temporal angle.

917
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,900
These are the mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

918
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,840
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

919
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:52,920
No atom of mere matter divides itself into alternate selves almost constantly but our universe does.

920
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,140
All the time the universe splits in order to express every alternative open to any phenomenon.

921
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:11,400
The universe is the only way our minds can express the perception of the fifth dimension or more properly the second dimension of time.

922
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,820
So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane rather than a line.

923
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:23,720
But there is another dimension of space, so is the case with time there is also a corresponding up-down time.

924
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,280
This is the direction in which our mental eyes exist.

925
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,420
In this direction we find alternate time tracks similar to the sidewise ones

926
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:38,500
with the difference being that theirs is order oriented in the direction opposed to temporal gravity.

927
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,520
So that elements of those other selves are constantly falling into our awareness from above.

928
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:56,280
The neutron passes through all these spaces with equal ease and is modulated by them much like the photon is modulated by bouncing off or passing through matter.

929
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:04,720
Thus information of a very subtle and distorted nature is conveyed to us from our other universes on the neutron express.

930
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,840
We call this information Gnosis.

931
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:17,200
And its influence has been felt by mankind time and again for as long back as we have records and no doubt back to our very genesis and before.

932
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,120
The earliest known neutron impact on earth occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

933
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,700
The primordial sea teamed with the most primitive of bacteria.

934
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,440
Their genetic material was a simple molecule shaped like a lumpy ladder.

935
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,620
It was very chemically stable.

936
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,120
The neutron passed through earth and spewed out a wake that left each and every molecule of DNA twisted beyond recognition.

937
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,600
In this state its stability was ruined.

938
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,500
And any force or random glitch that mother nature had to offer changed it somehow.

939
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,260
Thus evolution had begun.

940
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:00,220
Another notable neutron impact occurred about 60 million years ago at the end of the age of the dinosaurs.

941
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,800
The particle struck and its wake left the intelligence of the dinosaurs increased a million fold.

942
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:12,420
They promptly sat down, figured out how to teleport and promptly took off on around the universe vacation.

943
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,060
Presumably they will someday return.

944
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,480
Another notable neutron impact occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

945
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,040
The first neutron impact only about 5 million years ago was responsible for the division of the human and yeti races.

946
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,220
The vast majority of these events however affect individual beings or objects.

947
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:43,340
One such example is Great Britain's Stonehenge Monument which was not man made as is popularly presumed but is merely the material evidence of a rather minor neutron splash.

948
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,960
Certain great sages of the past and present have actually had neutrons pass directly through their crania.

949
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,180
A partial listing of these select people will give an idea of the effects that may be expected of such an encounter.

950
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:11,700
Gautama Buddha, the prophet Enoch, Ankh-Natan, Leonardo, William Beckford, Alastair Farley, Marcel Duchamp, R. Buckminster Fuller, Antonio Gaudi, Arnold Palmer, the list goes on.

951
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:18,380
It's interesting to note that J.R. Bob Dobbs is the only known human being through whom a neutron has passed twice.

952
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:25,960
After going through the back of his head it was reflected by the mystic pipe of Dobbs back through his head for a double dose of gnosis.

953
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,920
In the light of this particular view one might ask what about the big bang and all that stuff?

954
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,420
Well it seems that matter does not play a very big role in the actual nuts and bolts operation of the universe.

955
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,140
In fact we find that it is the case in about half the universe's sample that there is no matter at all.

956
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,800
Section B.

957
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,280
What we must do about all this.

958
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,780
It is well known that the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds of uses.

959
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:05,220
It might be less well known that alien civilizations of a level only slightly more advanced than ours routinely use the enormous power made available by tapping into the gravity fluxes of quantum black holes.

960
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,680
It's also possible to use the time potentials of the neutron to our own great advantage.

961
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,780
The neutron is not subject to the same methods of coercion that we use to create it.

962
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,140
It is subject to the power of the supernovae that bend normal subatomic particles to our will.

963
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,800
They are oblivious to matter and energy alike.

964
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:27,380
The power of pure thought because of its intimate relationship with time does have some small effect.

965
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,780
Mutrons are attracted to areas of concentrated slackful enlightenment.

966
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:41,880
A neutron container accelerator could be charged with a neutron if enough slackful minds concentrated their energies around a scoop entrance to the neutron accelerator.

967
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,640
Once contained therein

968
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,460
it would take relatively little effort on the part of these minds to maintain it in a circular path.

969
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,460
One purely technical problem facing this proposal is the size of the accelerator needed.

970
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,620
It is a property of the neutron that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

971
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,260
The minimum diameter of a circle to be traveled by a neutron is approximately 1,000 miles.

972
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,340
Fortunately we have easy access to an extraterrestrial body more than three times that size.

973
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,660
Earth's moon.

974
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,120
The accelerator could be built in a ring completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere about 100 feet below its surface.

975
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,520
Because of the mental effort that would run it, it would be known as the psychotron.

976
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,920
The psychotron would be a valuable tool in the use of practical time control.

977
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:41,360
By accelerating the neutron in one direction or another the entire moon could be induced to follow it in whatever temporal direction it might be directed.

978
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,440
Forward, backward, sideways or up-down.

979
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,780
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

980
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:56,200
It is my proposal that this device be constructed for use in a major project to concentrate high slack wisdom in this universe.

981
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,420
The single most radiant personality among modern man is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

982
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,860
There are other alternate Bobs existing in other alternate time tracks.

983
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,760
Not all of them are as prominent as our Bob, but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

984
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,960
Others are already the rulers of their respective Earths.

985
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,600
All, though, are truly Bob.

986
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,980
Imagine if we could travel to those alternate time streams and convince all of those Bobs to return to our world.

987
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,640
This is exactly what I am suggesting.

988
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,520
The formation of the Congress of Bobs.

989
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,220
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

990
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:44,240
Those who wish to donate to the Psychotron Project will be given a free ride to the alternate world of their choice once the project is complete.

991
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,740
Thank you.

992
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:36,860


993
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,460
No, the audience is not far away.

994
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:53,760
The Master Control Show here in the Master Control Program is controlling the show.

995
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:58,420
And this show will be the show that you will probably never hear.

996
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,900
And this show will go off to another subgenius show in another land.

997
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,340
And that will be a third show layered upon this show.

998
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:17,940
And after that show it will go on and continue spreading like a virus layer upon layer upon layer fading in and out from one another.

999
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,320
Like hideous forms of reintroduction.

1000
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,040
Your final instructions?

1001
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,960
And if you are a nice listener, we're going to read the whole phone book to you.

1002
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,960
Everyone's in the phone book.

1003
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,360
Remember something I mentioned this morning.

1004
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,600
The bowels of the heavens shall be opened to smite and trump the earth with strangeness.

1005
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,060
You, look.

1006
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,380
It's the colon of the earth.

1007
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,160
Let's pretend like we have a contest going.

1008
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,720
We'll just call people in the phone book and say, you won!

1009
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,260
And a little bit farther up the colon, just there, lips flapping in the wind.

1010
00:55:52,160 --> 00:56:01,500
...like hideous forms of reincarnation in the hell spirit world that you don't even know about because you're too ignorant.

1011
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,780
Ignorant because you're just a listener. That's all.

1012
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,940
Just a mere listener.

1013
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,760
Oh, the pathetic fools. The earth fools.

1014
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:19,180
Oh, ye stiff-legged, ye pathetic third-dimensional creatures.

1015
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:29,260
If you could but know, could but dream for an instant of that which could await you, were you good enough to...

1016
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,900
But, friends, there's no escape.

1017
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,480
Literally no escape from the show that never ends. Oh.

1018
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,360
Wasn't there some rock and roll song about the show that never ends?

1019
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:53,500
The amazing thing about this Jerry Jeff Preacher is that the caller calls up J. Neal's security staff on your priority code channel.

1020
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,500
This message will not repeat. Thank you for your attention.

1021
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,480
Please, make a note of it.

1022
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,000
I got a joke. How did Jerry Jeff Caller get the chicken fried steak out of his armpits?

1023
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,660
The trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

1024
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,020
You can't get it out of your armpits once it's put in the way he does it.

1025
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:08,940
Arms for defense.

1026
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,160
Those arms are the pits.

1027
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,040
Yes.

1028
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,860
Keep on arming.

1029
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,780
Well, Jerry Jeff...

1030
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,360
You'll wind up in the pits, yes. The basic message of today's military environment.

1031
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,700
It's quiet out there.

1032
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh, nice, huh?

1033
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,080
He's a flibberty jibbit and a hick dominica Honda Sock-de-loo rib tick-less.

1034
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,980
Yes, right.

1035
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:32,980
Let's call it an unnecessary, completely unauthorized, and overextended military operation in a completely virgin environment.

1036
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,460
Hissed. The zickering of a thicket of gigantic crickets.

1037
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,780
Just the thickering of the...

1038
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,300
I'll just turn that down. We don't want any of that stuff happening here.

1039
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:51,040
In the swamp bongs the gongs of a throng of frogs while a knee-deep sheep bleats in a slippery stream where slimy snakes whisper sinful secrets.

1040
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,100
Let's go back to the knee-deep sheep dip, okay?

1041
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,960
The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below the steep and deep...

1042
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:04,100
...and chilly waters of the deep stream floats on the surface like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief.

1043
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,800
...and true, flies and leaps and leaps...

1044
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:13,360
For they thought they would never die, but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi, horrible mummies to march across the earth and wreak and spew vengeance.

1045
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,940
Sarcophagi? Knees? They came back as?

1046
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:15,960
Give me the pyroflagellator.

1047
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,060
All of the little tiny...

1048
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:18,420
Yes.

1049
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,660
...bad deities march down the side of the subgenius church and now live that night.

1050
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:22,720
See? At last.

1051
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,380
Within the great pyramid...

1052
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:24,500
Here they go!

1053
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,940
...the secret chamber of the subgenius...

1054
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,360
Oh, we've entered the...

1055
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,360
What light and steam come from the special effects department located below the pyramid?

1056
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:39,860
...here, inside the heart of the mighty structure, puzzling evidence broadcasts from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

1057
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,820
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio. Come on down.

1058
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:48,240
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations of a primitive nature which broadcast by the strange...

1059
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,380
I'll play rock and roll until every eight falls apart. I'll copy that old Procter and Bergen movie.

1060
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,720
...then they would show the strange films to the walls of the...

1061
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,660
Come on, let's watch J-Man.

1062
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:02,940
...the old media reads that their mummified kitty cats in their canopic jars would ever view these great epics.

1063
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,240
Oh, there's Kitty!

1064
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,400
Oh, why did they have to keep Paul Kitty's brain out through her nostrils?

1065
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,660
...to the ancient Egyptians. The cat, as well as the diggy dog, was a mysterious and powerful god that had to be placated.

1066
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,920
What a powerful god! Let's play rock and roll.

1067
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,480
...they would have chopped Kitty's nostrils out through her brain with a little machine they've invented.

1068
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,680
Yes, they drew your brain out through your nostrils with silver hooks.

1069
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,960
This I learned at the house of my father, the brain extractor by the Nile.

1070
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,600
But I haven't finished with that brain.

1071
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:36,220
That is all right, Senhuay. You may have the brain of the next traveler who passes by.

1072
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,500
Ah, my son, there are many brains for us to work on.

1073
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,440
For the land of Egypt is mighty and rich, and the Nile Delta is...

1074
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,960
Brain after brain was passed from one listener to another, and they would call the show and fight the show.

1075
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,680
Suddenly they saw a little brat in the bulrushes.

1076
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,620
In a basket.

1077
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,160
I see you down there, little caller.

1078
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,500
How can so many people be without one brain?

1079
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,580
I have only one brain to divide amongst all these...

1080
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,220
And so little Senhuay learned of head-launching and how it was done by the mighty river.

1081
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:14,160
Ah, the holy Vic Morrow, the only true head-launching done here in California.

1082
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,120
By a professional crew.

1083
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,300
Film the right way.

1084
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,460
Not this false Arnold Palmer garbage.

1085
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,020
It would have made it worse.

1086
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:29,700
But we can't talk about that because it would leave this station open to libel and slander.

1087
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,440
That's our lawyer now! Oh my God, he heard us!

1088
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,980
That guy's going to sue us about the bleeding handle... subliminal message.

1089
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,760
Station KXCI in Tucson, Arizona. Station KABF in Little Rock, Arkansas.

1090
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,560
As Hal falls back on reading the list of stations that don't play any of this stuff ever again.

1091
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,980
We wonder exactly what it all means.

1092
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,680
We hope you enjoy it.

1093
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,820
He calls in all the time.

1094
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,160
And continue to provide us with valuable callers and feedbacks.

1095
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,920
Ladies and gentlemen, just tell us how you do it.

1096
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,200
What kind of band is this?

1097
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,660
What kind of song is this?

1098
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,300
What do they know of life?

1099
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,080
First, we took in virtually all of the subgenius funds and absconded and lived in luxury for many years thereafter...

1100
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,800
Hi, little caller.

1101
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
And now it's showtime.

1102
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,300
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

1103
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,580
The show that dare not even exist.

1104
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,620
And the sun comes up over Northern and Central California.

1105
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,040
And we wonder why we're awake.

1106
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,520
It's only 4 on Friday afternoon.

1107
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,240
We're finishing the last tape of the show now.

1108
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,760
In 24 hours, people will hear this show on the radio.

1109
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,300
And they'll think it's loud.

1110
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,340
And they'll call up and pretend.

1111
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,300
Kill me. No, no. Kill me.

1112
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,520
No, me. Kill me. No, no.

1113
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,340
He's a tough, rabid danger.

1114
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,220
He's a...

1115
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,940
That's those shows still going?

1116
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:59,860
Oh, yeah, that show's still running endlessly, mindlessly, reasonlessly.

1117
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,880
Like most, most lives nowadays.

1118
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,160
No guidance, no center.

1119
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,820
Yes, yes.

1120
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,940
Hear that sound, dear friends?

1121
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:16,820
Do you hear that low, mournful sound?

1122
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,020
That's the sound.

1123
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:45,100
The sound of a normal soul floating off, unhinged and its anchor raised, leaving its body and floating off to join the other normal souls in the great syrup where they're all stirred together to be reborn again, all exactly alike.

1124
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:16,040
And here, high atop the inner First Bank building in Dallas, Texas, we broadcast this news of the final truth, the ultimate punchline of the end of the universe to you, the mere listener.

1125
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,020
Ah, yes.

1126
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:20,700
Ah, yes.

1127
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,260
The show comes in for a landing once again.

1128
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,220
Hyper jump.

1129
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,920
Okay, can you take it from here?

1130
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,100
Because run the auto computer on seven.

1131
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,840
I've got to go over there and...

1132
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,400
Oh, you're gonna play with the beast again, Eddie?

1133
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,560
No, the beast's been programmed.

1134
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,920
It's doing the squid run right now.

1135
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,040
But I have to get some more of that frock, Doctor.

1136
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,220
Oh, oh, wait.

1137
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,040
There's...

1138
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,460
Good Lord.

1139
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,800
You have...

1140
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,320
You, Doctor, have consumed it.

1141
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,340
You have consumed it.

1142
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:49,340


1143
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:54,200
I'm gonna get an entire bathtub full of the sacred Tibetan herb, habifra...

1144
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,000
Wait, wait a minute, listen, listen.

1145
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:57,340
What?

1146
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,820
It's Recon Metal 12.

1147
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,460
Oh, no.

1148
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,060
Shh.

1149
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:01,920
Launch base...

1150
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,500
Hey, we've gotta...

1151
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,020
Well, hold on.

1152
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,840
We'll be back after this message.

1153
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,420
Okay, listen.

1154
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,840
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, love you.

1155
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, love you.

1156
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,460
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, love you.

1157
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1158
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,420
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, love you.

1159
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,300
And so we find our time running out.

1160
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,200
As I say, this is the same way every show.

1161
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,820
It all ends the same way.

1162
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,680
And I would recommend reading prescription 16, 14, 17, 18.

1163
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,900
And you can write for information on how to receive these precious subgenius tapes.

1164
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:41,160
Because, friends, we need blankets and contraceptives for those boys and girls in the home for slackless

1165
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:41,500
children.

1166
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,380
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1167
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,000
I command you to spill your gift seed.

1168
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:49,280
Bob.

1169
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:49,500
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1170
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:49,500


1171
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:49,500


1172
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:49,500


1173
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,600
We're on a pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills in my lap.

1174
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:58,560
As this will buy modeling clay, and transformer toys for those poor children.

1175
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,720
Dobbs will bless you for planting the seed, Faith, ah, yes.

1176
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,580
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,ismon.

1177
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:07,920
And now our announcer will give you our mailing address.

1178
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:08,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,ball, Bob, love you.

1179
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,680
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, love you.

1180
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,060
Bob love you.

1181
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,220
Bob love you.
