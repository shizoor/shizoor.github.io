1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
A one, two, three, fire!

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,320
Leave it to the subgenius.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,720
Power of sweat.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,260
Whoa, isn't that something?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,220
What do you mean?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,640
If anyone gets any answers, it'll be the psychiatrist.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,400
Oh, that's terrible.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes, yes, and no.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,260
Huh? Are you trying to give me the double talk?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,320
Yes, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,660
The subgenius agenda.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,580
Through the leadership of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,760
his vision of a 22nd century America

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,220
where subgeniosity is the subgenius lifestyle,

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,240
Dobbs has repeatedly addressed subgeniuses,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,280
saying, I have a vision and you are part of it.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,280
Topic.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,720
Welcome.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,220
Come on.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,800
Mind research.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,780
Research.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,240
That's why.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,920
You call fooling around with superstitions

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,100
and voodoo rights research?

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,580
Yeah.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,980
Well, it's...

27
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,660
It's a cult.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,300
We have to do this.

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,780
The work I'm doing is very important.

30
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,360
Look, they're over the bridge now.

31
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,480
They're on the other side of the...

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,880
It's okay.

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,740
Oh, darn.

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Well, that wouldn't be avoided.

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,940
It's just wiggled around.

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,280
That'll work.

38
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,580
That'll work.

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,620
We'll just use that scene then.

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,300
You just need to alarm them.

41
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,380
Tie him down securely.

42
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,220
Doctor!

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,280
Here, see?

44
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,700
Your friend.

45
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,260
Quickly.

46
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,660
Oh, oh.

47
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,260
I guess even the doctor begins to lose faith

48
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,940
when he's caught up with him.

49
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,900
I think he's leaning on his computer.

50
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean, his keyboard.

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,520
All right.

52
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,340
Forever?

53
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:30,840


54
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,540
I'd like to try it.

55
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
That's a heck of a long time.

56
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:33,940
You know, Doc,

57
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,840
I made an amazing scientific discovery

58
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,040
in this laboratory of yours.

59
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,420
Looks like he's coming around.

60
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,940
Okay, all right.

61
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,340
It's Ivan Stang.

62
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,400
We're resuscitating Ivan Stang now.

63
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,080
It's my dad.

64
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,580
I'm stabbing...

65
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,620
I just stabbed a scalpel into his heart.

66
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,340
That's just a stupid superstition.

67
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,180
No, no, no.

68
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,880
You're a real guy.

69
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,240
Come on.

70
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,740
Yes, you are right.

71
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,300
Come on, come on, come on, Ivan.

72
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,060
You can do it.

73
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,360
Come on, come on, come on.

74
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
There's a queen of you.

75
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh, she's outside trying to get in the studio.

76
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,160
Come on, Ivan.

77
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,740
Come on.

78
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,660
We're attaching the...

79
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:04,980
Okay.

80
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,560
There we go.

81
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,000
You know,

82
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,440
it's not nearly enough for you to believe in Bob.

83
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
You must suck his entrails with your psychic firmament.

84
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,980
You must live in Bob's own depleted spaces.

85
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,480
It is only musky-roomly.

86
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,040
Oh.

87
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,540
God, it's musky in his humily.

88
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,040
His little humily door where he keeps his humily worms.

89
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,320
His little humworms and men pets.

90
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,220
Oh, look at that.

91
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,800
Men things.

92
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,940
I wouldn't want that on my leg.

93
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm excited.

94
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,380
Horrible.

95
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,920
Not in the middle of some...

96
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Ugly men things.

97
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Soon enough, you'll be searching for dobs on the scaly roof of your mouth.

98
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,940
Soon enough.

99
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,420
There.

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,460
You hear me?

101
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,900
Oh, none.

102
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,380
The male will change from a greasy green to a bright, beneficent blue.

103
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,800
Blue.

104
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,740
We're worried about the subconscious messages that they're sending.

105
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,060
Me too.

106
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,700
Yeah, we worry.

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,620
You mean the subliminal radio signals that are in everything?

108
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,820
Even your back teeth fillings?

109
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,080
Are they?

110
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,800
Those are the ones you should really worry about.

111
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,580
The ones they broadcast right into your teeth.

112
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,740
Because you can hear those at night when you're asleep.

113
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,000
And your ears, you know, you got your ear canal right there next to your back teeth.

114
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,760
It's sort of whispering up that ear canal all the time and you don't even know it.

115
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
So how do you know that there are subliminal messages happening?

116
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,160
Well, the government, the new government channels, and I switch channels and then I just get stuff.

117
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,380
You get stuff on the channels?

118
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
They're editing this out right now.

119
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,180
Yeah, there's some kind of editing going on.

120
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,840
I think you need to turn up your phone or something.

121
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,340
But it's funny because a lot of people are different.

122
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,820
I think that...

123
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,860
Now, do you have that antenna hooked up right now?

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
Well, yeah, I have.

125
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
I have the...

126
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,220
I got some stereo wires and I drug them all across my floor.

127
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,260
Back and forth?

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:06,780
Yeah.

129
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
I hope with this show turned up very loudly.

130
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,080
So did it generate a static charge negative ion field on the surface of the floor about three inches above the floor?

131
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,300
That you were only able to detect with the use of your vacuum cleaner?

132
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,540
Yeah.

133
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
You know, maybe not like...

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,140
You're confusing.

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, I think you should be confused to a certain extent because your receptivity will increase that way and therefore make the antenna more powerful.

136
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,180
Yeah.

137
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm unacceptable.

138
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,960
This was confirmed this morning in conversations I had with leaders of Russia and Japan.

139
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called PR News a threat to the entire world.

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,600
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.

141
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,400
PR's reports remain on a downward...

142
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,600
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
PR's reports remain on a downward spiral with a drop of PR News in Washington.

144
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,020
Reminds me of a...

145
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,180
Really?

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,920
Flying along here with us now.

147
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,200
Early in the morning.

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,100
On a happy...

149
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,140
Happy.

150
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,980
It's a cloud.

151
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Sort of.

152
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,780
A new political wind.

153
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm all there.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,060
I'm all for it.

155
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,120
Yeah, we're all over it.

156
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,580
I'm up.

157
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,840
Lockstep.

158
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm right with you.

159
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,440
Yeah.

160
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,300
The Homeland Security people will.

161
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,440
We buy in the morning.

162
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
And they'll check out your house and your life and...

163
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,660
Can you...

164
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
Do not want to check out my house.

165
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,520
FM radio waves to me?

166
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,000
They have to check out everything.

167
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,620
Yeah, we use all radio waves.

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,580
But can you explain how they work?

169
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,560
How radio waves work?

170
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes.

171
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,020
We have the overman here tonight.

172
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,140
Tough question.

173
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,800
Yeah.

174
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,260
Philo Drummond.

175
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,520
Philo Drummond.

176
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,440
Philo Drummond.

177
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,580
Philo Drummond.

178
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:56,700
Philo Drummond.

179
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,700


180
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,700


181
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,700


182
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,140
After being in the...

183
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,760
You can hear the conference in the background.

184
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,160
What do you think?

185
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
You know, is that...

186
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
We'll explain that.

187
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,920
How does radio work?

188
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,940
Dr. Drummond, we have a young lady who wanted to know about how radio waves work.

189
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,340
So do you have, like...

190
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,000
Do we have...

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,940
You've got headphones on?

192
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,860
Yeah, you can know.

193
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Radio waves.

194
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
I do have headphones on.

195
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,040
Radio waves.

196
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay.

197
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, radio waves.

198
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,660
Well, they're like...

199
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,160
Because I am the show.

200
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,260
They're these little things.

201
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,640
They sort of float out there.

202
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,420
They've got, like, little tentacles on them that kind of hang in space but have their own

203
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,300
modified cilia that are constantly flowing in the breeze and as the breeze

204
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:40,400
passes by the cilia sort of undulate and drive the organism, the sound wave, on its journey to your ears.

205
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,220
Does that help? It helps. And this music always plays when radio waves are, you know, even if

206
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,820
you're listening to a discussion show about atomic waste, this music would be

207
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,440
playing in the background, you just can't hear it. But music like this is always

208
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,300
controlling your emotional reaction. That's true. Music like this is hanging

209
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,240
around along with the radio waves. Or music like this. Radio waves have an

210
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,800
affinity for music like this. They just kind of hang together in a symbiotic

211
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,500
relationship. There were a few producers who were involved with the kind of underworld.

212
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,800
But then, if you do it, if you accept the money from them,

213
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,420
you must be ready for the guns as well. Well, you accept it for what it is. It could be money,

214
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,940
it could be guns, or it could be butter. You know, depending on your state and the state that you're

215
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,620
in. You know, I want to get back to some of the magic about Pangea and Lemuria and Guandana.

216
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh yeah, back in the old days, the old, when we were just hanging out. The old ways. Because I've

217
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,660
seen video from that time. Yeah, we were like just a pack of amoebas, you know, like

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,940
running wild, hanging around. It's like, let's extend our protoplasm over into that area for a while.

219
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,200
You know, the next thing we know, they were just like, I had a twin there, looked just like me.

220
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,040
And, you know, what's going on here? So we started hanging around together for a while. Next thing we

221
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,960
knew, we were like a symbiotic organism of individual cells that was all together with

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,620
their own collective purpose. Slathering and slithering until

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:44,140
one day we had a flagella. And we stuck that flagella out. We started manipulating our environment and we decided, you know, maybe we should think about crawling out into that other atmosphere. You know, we should leave this sweaty, liquid environment and move beyond it. Move over into that dry area. Of course, we need some legs.

224
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,840
Looks like ghost town. No, it does look like ghost town.

225
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,720
So we did, and there we are. And so that's how it happened.

226
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,060
Okay, any more? Can I help you with any other questions?

227
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,300
Ladies and gentlemen, station KOQW would like to present now a serious documentary program,

228
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:10,020
an investigation of serious topics of our time as they relate to the industry. Would you get that up, please? Thank you very much.

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
I got it.

230
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
Shh, now everybody is public service.

231
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,680
Let me get in here. Let me get in here.

232
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,780
Do I sit right here?

233
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,720
Yes, sit right here.

234
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:21,900
Okay.

235
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,460
Mm-hmm.

236
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,220
Now, the microphones will be coming on in just a moment.

237
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay.

238
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,680
Do I put on a little rubber?

239
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,740
Am I supposed to read this?

240
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,560
I don't need a rubber.

241
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:28,940
Here's your cue coming up.

242
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,220
Your cue is coming up.

243
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,200
Shubbing up, please. Watch the music.

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
Quiet, please. Here it goes.

245
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,520
Just a moment now.

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,740
All right, fade music and, uh, lights on.

247
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,200
Love that tune.

248
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,580
Shh.

249
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:52,440
When we speak of G-men, all of us gets a picture immediately of a band of little-known, courageous men risking their lives to defend the Tri-City area from the soft underbelly of criminals, spies, saboteurs, or shoe-women.

250
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,940
The

251
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:21,780
Tonight in the studio with me is Mr. Blank, special agent in charge of the metropolis field office of the feudal federal chest of drawers.

252
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,420
All right.

253
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,820
Sorry.

254
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,880
Federal bureau of drawers to investigate us about little-known facts concerning his work.

255
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,500
Yes, Mr. Announcer.

256
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,640
Everyone is hearing about espionage agents and saboteurs so much now, it's hard to think.

257
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,640
There's more.

258
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,100
No, it's hard to think that just a few years ago, no one even knew that saboteurs had agents.

259
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,740
Yes.

260
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,620
To start off with, Mr. Blank, shouldn't I have your name here?

261
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,520
Blank.

262
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,180
Blank.

263
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:10,200
What are some of the violations handled by the squalid squad, which are not as well known as the White Trash Traffic Act and the National Migratory Sponge Theft Act?

264
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:18,520
Well, for example, you, Mr. Announcer, are presently, right now, in violation of the concealed radio statute.

265
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,100
No.

266
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,060
Yes.

267
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:31,200
By not broadcasting the call letters of this radio station every 10 minutes, you could be jeopardizing the security of this area and my family and friends within its perimeters.

268
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Blank.

269
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,840
This is exciting and serious as if it were real.

270
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,020
Oh, yes, yes, of course this is real.

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,760
And you'll be convicted and sent to radio prison after the show is over.

272
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
No doubt, Mr. Blank.

273
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,380
Many of...

274
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh, no doubt, Mr. Blank, many of our listeners who have traveled around extensively today will...

275
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,180
and other small towns in Arizona,

276
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,840
will remember that Radio Prism

277
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,260
is located in this particular section

278
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,200
of extremely rugged and unusual beauty

279
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,580
because of the pointed desert nearby

280
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,560
and the many very colored canyons.

281
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,740
Yes, that's where the colored people are kept.

282
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,020
Mr. Blanc, although we think of women as the Gentile sex,

283
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,340
I recall that in the past you G-string G-men

284
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,620
have been dealt from the bottom of the deck of sex

285
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,260
with some who were not gentle in any sense of the term.

286
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,160
That makes sense to me, Mr. Announcer.

287
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes, a special agent was once assigned the task

288
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,640
of taking 15% of a mannish, big-boned woman of 150 pounds

289
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,580
who was charged with shooting a frog.

290
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,800
Bang, bang!

291
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,840
That must have been terrible, Mr. Blanc.

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,140
Yes, Mr. Announcer.

293
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,440
You know, taking a picture of a Frenchman

294
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,140
can have some pretty serious consequences nowadays.

295
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
I get the connection.

296
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,200
Uh, you bet, Mr. Blanc.

297
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,740
No, no, I don't.

298
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
It's against the law, too.

299
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,280
Accompanied only by three dozen officers,

300
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,740
he started down the path to the shack.

301
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
But this path was by no means easy.

302
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,500
No, it was guarded by two mean gridley bears.

303
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,660
Gridley bears who lunged, lunged horribly right toward them.

304
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
The party walked around them.

305
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Then walked around.

306
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,040
And then walked around them again.

307
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,120
Can we take this again?

308
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,720
Was she finally taken into custody?

309
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,340
Yes.

310
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,960
The officers entered the one-room shack.

311
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,200
Even then, it took two days to reach the other side.

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,560
No.

313
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,420
Yes, the one-room shack was also a zeppelin holder.

314
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,580
Or hanger, so-called,

315
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,680
because you could either hang the zeppelin up

316
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,600
when you weren't using it,

317
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,180
or you could hold on to it.

318
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,380
No.

319
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,500
Now, the special agent, he talked to the woman,

320
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,620
stroking her gently,

321
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,600
describing the pleasure of a 75-year-old woman.

322
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,620


323
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,240
she'd been to the jail for a five-mile ride in a fast car.

324
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,840
Well, she went willingly,

325
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,680
and later confidentially advised her agent

326
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
that she liked the jail very much

327
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,900
since she was steam-heated

328
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,380
and had to be around a lot of water.

329
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Well, you must be thinking of Comley Lucy Baumiller,

330
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,160
the 39-inch secretary to Kurt Klaus Pfeffer, the Nazi spy.

331
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,980
I don't think I'll ever be able to stop thinking about her.

332
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Well, Mr. Blank, Blonk,

333
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,980
I want to thank you for being here.

334
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
Yes. Good morning.

335
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,220
Good morning.

336
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,580
You have given us all a new slant

337
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,840
on the topic of oriental girls in crime,

338
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,980
and it has been most interesting.

339
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,900
With you G-men on the job,

340
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,000
we must sure feel that Nazi communes

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
will surely be unsuccessful in their attempts,

342
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,360
however vague, to injure our area.

343
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,480
What's happening?

344
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,860
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

345
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,860
We'll be back once again next week

346
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,660
with the Pet Me Eye Story,

347
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,100
brought to you for Public Service Talk,

348
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,100


349
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
every time, every week at this hour.

350
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,400
We'll take it again.

351
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,540
We'll take it again.

352
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,420
No, we'll take it again.

353
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,120
It's all right.

354
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,980
We can take it again.

355
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,020
We can take it again.

356
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Why don't we go to Top 40 now?

357
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,060
The gun scares the children.

358
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Top 40.

359
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,080
Top 40.

360
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,040
Top 40.

361
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,820
Top 40.

362
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,340
A reverend staying here in the alleged year of 2021.

363
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,020
That was the Firesign Theatre,

364
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,840
a recording from when even I was a baby tweenager.

365
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,080
From their ancient radio show, All That.

366
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,540
Off the new old album collection called Dope Humor of the 70s.

367
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,080
Findable at FiresignTheatre.com.

368
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,140
We're doing a thing tonight that's half puzzling evidence

369
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,200
and half rare Firesign Theatre

370
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,700
and half ESO Swamp Radio

371
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,220
with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and me,

372
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,920
and half Philodrummon following an alien around

373
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,540
out in the desert planet somewhere.

374
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,340
The Murr did titles and news,

375
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,060
and the background music here is by CyberCharm.

376
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
And now, in the future,

377
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,600
back to 2001 for the puzzling evidence show on KPFA Berkeley

378
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,380
with special regular guest stars Dr. Philodrummon,

379
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,520
Dr. Hal, and hapless callers number 67 and 879.

380
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,640
So what if the South had won the Civil War?

381
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,180
What would have happened then, huh?

382
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,740
Huh?

383
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,460
What if the Spanish had won the Spanish-American War?

384
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,060
Well, if the South had won the Civil War,

385
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,340
we probably would have been able to have another...

386
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,580
What if the Germans had won World War VI?

387
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,000
Then we'd have to frat.

388
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,980
I think it's time to frat.

389
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Okay.

390
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,180
All right.

391
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,580
Whew!

392
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,980
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm sure glad that happened.

394
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,360
Okay, um...

395
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,840
I want to be glad.

396
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,780
The thing is, the Civil War never ended.

397
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,640
It's still going on.

398
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,160
The South winning, if you have...

399
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,820
It never started.

400
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,620
It started all right.

401
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,820
No, no, no.

402
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,520
It was the uncivil war that started.

403
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,080
There's nothing civil about that war.

404
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,780
Well, you got all...

405
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,180
That was a damnable war.

406
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Romantic.

407
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,800
Yeah, but what would James Joyce have said about it?

408
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,420
What would Aunt Bertha have said about it?

409
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,000
What would...

410
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,220
Yeah, what would Aunt Bertha have said?

411
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,220
Jesus did not always stay a baby,

412
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,200
although I think he must have been the most adorable baby

413
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,940
you ever saw.

414
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,100
Aw, Aunt Bertha.

415
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,120
He's a Jesus.

416
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,280
Still, he was the only baby, and he grew,

417
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,660
just as you boys and girls have grown.

418
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,260
Oh, boy.

419
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,820
Oh, hey, let go of me.

420
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,080
Oh, let me go.

421
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,340
Let go.

422
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,380
It's wonderful to know that Jesus

423
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,620
was once a child like me

424
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,300
and lived on earth and worked and played

425
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,380
in his home in Galilee.

426
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,180
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus

427
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,520
Who was once a child like me

428
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,240
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus

429
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,460
Like him I want to be

430
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,160
Before his parents could hardly believe it,

431
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,160
Jesus was 12 years old.

432
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,100
He was a fine lad.

433
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,800
And Luke tells us in chapter 2,

434
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,180
verses 41 through 42,

435
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,300
a beautiful story about Jesus

436
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,360
when he was 12 years old.

437
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah, was Jesus, or was Dean Moriarty Jesus?

438
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,260
God is in every sparrow plummeting to the ground.

439
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well put.

440
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,080
Well put.

441
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,720
Or is that old?

442
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that one before.

443
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,720
Is that old or something?

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,120
It's a cross-reference.

445
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,780
It's James Jones or somebody else.

446
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,540
God Junior said that.

447
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,780
Oh, God Junior said that?

448
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,680
God sees every...

449
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,220
sparrow that falls.

450
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,160
Oh, see, Chaz, I was just going to ask about

451
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,260
on the Easter theme.

452
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
I am kind of a...

453
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
The thematic Easter theme.

454
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,500
Do you believe in the classical that God and Jesus is the same guy?

455
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,160
Or do you believe that God is...

456
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,400
Jesus is God's kid, and therefore...

457
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
but then see, it wouldn't...

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,520
I don't believe in any separation between God

459
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,240
and any atom in the universe.

460
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,520
And so therefore, it's a moot point.

461
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Why are you asking me?

462
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
I might as well be a secular humanist, rationalist,

463
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,220
sub-genius for all the difference it would make.

464
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,880
Now, but where did the evil come in?

465
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm actually a totally mystical, cosmic-minded philosopher.

466
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,500
I think evil came in.

467
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,620
But it happens to take the form of atheism.

468
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,020
I think the evil started when they let him stink in the tomb too long.

469
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,340
Yeah, well, evil started...

470
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,620
No, I think evil started when...

471
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,340
Because we're, you know, the remnants of a burned-out star.

472
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,560
Ruminants, ruminants.

473
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,940
An older star blew up.

474
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,080
Weren't ruminants like the...

475
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
Yeah, an older star blew up, made our solar system...

476
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,140
The shadow.

477
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,600
We came out of that.

478
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,360
Maybe in that explosion, something went wrong.

479
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,680
I think evil was invented about the same time as time.

480
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,160
Any explosion, something goes wrong, doesn't it?

481
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,820
As soon as something started to happen, some things were good,

482
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,140
and some of the things were evil.

483
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,180
Right. There's your yin and yang and your potatoes right in your thumb.

484
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,940
You know, when you said it was...

485
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,520
Is that where evil started with the...

486
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,020
Any explosion, something can go wrong.

487
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
So perhaps if it was like Jali,

488
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,940
and like you guys were claiming that you could hit the wall with your sperm a couple hours ago.

489
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,540
Remember when you were bragging about that?

490
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:10,720
Yeah.

491
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,600
God probably thought he could shoot his seeds across the entire...

492
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,100
You know, it's a big place.

493
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, that's called the Milky Way.

494
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,080
Well, the fact that it created this beautiful world that we live in is the good part,

495
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,940
and the fact that it created this hideous world that we live in is the evil part.

496
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,760
Hello, friends.

497
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,480
Yes, I'm Bernard Flapdoodle,

498
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,220
founder and president of the Funny Name Club of America.

499
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,220
That's right, the Funny Name Club.

500
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,980
You see, many Americans don't realize

501
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,840
the plight of that crippled member of society,

502
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,780
the fella or gal with a funny name.

503
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,920
And that's where we come in, in the Funny Name Club of America.

504
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,220
At our weekly meetings, held weekly in many friendly communities,

505
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,400
a member of this underprivileged, yet usually highly paid minority,

506
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,360
has a chance to mingle with others who share his infirmity

507
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,260
and to gain a sense of pride and brotherhood for the achievements of his kind.

508
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,960
Most Americans don't realize that it was our own right,

509
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,120
Robert Louis Dildo,

510
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,800
who invented the retrievable garage door.

511
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,740
That Mrs. Louise Yakamoto, the well-known war heroine,

512
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,120
purchased 45 gas bags, which still float above selected American cities,

513
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,160
each proudly bearing a funny name.

514
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,700
And while most wouldn't know the well-known Donald Duck,

515
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,540
what of the pain to his family and friends?

516
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,960
Yes, we all owe quite a debt to these guys.

517
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,760
These brave Americans of humorous descent.

518
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,140
Will any of us soon forget Adolph Schicklgruber?

519
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
We can't afford not to.

520
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,940
Yes, soon is quick enough for us.

521
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,520
So send your support to a chapter near you.

522
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,080
Don't forget about the little ones at Christmas either.

523
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes, here's our poster girl, little Tricky Schlemiel of Metro Glen, North Carolina,

524
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,140
to remind you that Americans with funny names are just people too.

525
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,920
Thank you.

526
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,180
I'm glad that we have warning messages on everything now.

527
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,580
Yeah.

528
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,480
So that there's product lia- there is no product liability anymore.

529
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,600
I mean, people can't be- it's a good thing we stamp it on everything now

530
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,420
because, you know, for a while there, lawyers were just getting rich

531
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,340
from people that, you know, they'd walk up, they'd hit themselves in the head with a hammer

532
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,280
because they didn't- couldn't aim it,

533
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,940
and then they would sue the hammer company and win, you know?

534
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,960
And it's like, so now they put a- they put a label on a hammer that says,

535
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
do not hit yourself in the head with this.

536
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,260
I think you can get some money.

537
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah.

538
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,940
It all depends who wins the argument.

539
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,340
Oh, it definitely, certainly.

540
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,940
No, people that lose arguments generally don't win.

541
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,760
Generally.

542
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,600
And so, what happens?

543
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,180
If you find- if you find something offensive on a major label-

544
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,260
Unless, of course, the object was to lose.

545
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,560
... have a label?

546
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,860
Yeah.

547
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,420
Maybe?

548
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,300
Yeah, if it doesn't have, like, a parental advisory label and you find something offensive on it,

549
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,160
like, and then you let a kid listen to it, can you then say,

550
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,260
well, I'm gonna sue the major label?

551
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,960
A good lawyer can win the argument.

552
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,680
Probably could.

553
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,880
But, you know, it all depends how good the listener is.

554
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,240
I think if a kid listens to a record that's got the parental warning on it,

555
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,020
and then he still goes out and kills, they can sue the parents for not heeding the warning.

556
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'd sue negatively.

557
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,060
Yeah, that's what I would do.

558
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Well-

559
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,920
You can always sue the parents for not being good parents, no matter what.

560
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,380
Yeah.

561
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,700
They're sort of like the last resort.

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,240
Last deep pocket.

563
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,080
I mean, even if you were suing a major company and they weren't getting what you wanted,

564
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,120
you could always sue the president of the company's parents for raising him wrong,

565
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,820
and then you could shake them down for a few bucks, you know.

566
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,420
Where do rules come from, mother?

567
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Where do we get them?

568
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,680
Rules are very, very old, Bobby.

569
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,100
They're like stories and poems.

570
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,920
Men learned them before they had learned to write.

571
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,960
But how did the first rules get made?

572
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,720
You remember, Bobby, that we read from the Bible a big poem about how Grid planned the world?

573
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah, he planned land and water and light and darkness and grass and animals and power lines.

574
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,240
I remember.

575
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,780
God planned the world so that we could depend upon it.

576
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,440
God made the world so that the sun and the seeds and all the power lines would obey his rules.

577
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Did the sun and the seeds and the power lines really obey rules?

578
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,100
Yes, dear.

579
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,600
That's how farmers and scientists and policemen can know when to plant their crops.

580
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
And when to expect them to blow up.

581
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,560
Did God make rules for people too, mother?

582
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,660
God did make rules for people, son.

583
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,700
But there's a great difference about the rules for people.

584
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,340
For instance, you blow pot.

585
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,500
Daddy and I get stinko.

586
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,560
The sun and the seeds do not choose.

587
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,020
They just obey their rules without knowing that they are obeying their rules.

588
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,800
And that's the way you should obey your rules, Bobby, or I'll belt you.

589
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,680
Can we do the Stations of the Cross now?

590
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,080
Okay, ready?

591
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,980
Hit, heap, hit, heap, heap.

592
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,780
You've got to get in line if you're going to do them.

593
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,820
And remember, every time you genuflect, you want to flip off a little prayer this way or that way.

594
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,580
Okay?

595
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,920
This way.

596
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,760
Let's pray this way.

597
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,900
Let's pray that way.

598
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,000
Get down on your knees and bend over.

599
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,540
Jesus has his face wiped by the women.

600
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,060
Jesus has his nose flung.

601
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,940
He's been flexed by the man next door.

602
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,580
Is that what Jesus was doing under them when...

603
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,880
Jesus flares his nostrils.

604
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,000
Jesus cries out in pain,

605
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,920
Why don't you leave me alone?

606
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,080
Come on, Chaz. We've only got seven more to go, or twelve, or whatever.

607
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm sorry.

608
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,060
Jesus pulls his hat down tight over his eyes.

609
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,300
Um...

610
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,420
Jesus forgives the Sagittarians for plummeting his mothbroughs.

611
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,520
Jesus falls for the nineteenth time.

612
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,860
Ow!

613
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,620
That's blasphemous, you guys.

614
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,900
Jesus takes the Thorn of Crowns and uses it as a fetish device on Mary Magdalene.

615
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,800
I am so glad I wasn't raised religious.

616
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Jesus prepares the onion dip before...

617
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,340
Hey, baby.

618
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,380
...achieving Golgotha.

619
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,140
You know, I didn't get into that.

620
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,620
I took some serious S&M ass-whippin' from them nuns.

621
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,980
I can say anything I want.

622
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,060
Yeah, you know, it's funny, though.

623
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,240
Chaz went to serious, serious schoolage.

624
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,400
People are always there saying, Reverend Stang, what religion burned your brain?

625
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,940
You must really hate some religion.

626
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,760
Was the nuns wrapping your hands with those rulers, or what?

627
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,460
It's like, no, my family didn't really particularly go to church or anything. We were...

628
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,760
You're a rationalist family.

629
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,900
Sort of, yeah.

630
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,300
And so you rationally...

631
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,280
Actually, my dad is like a lay preacher and knows more about the Bible than most preachers do.

632
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,940
So those guys just...

633
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,500
For that matter, I know more about the Bible than most Christians do.

634
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,340
But I...that...you know, I never did go...know much about those rituals of the Catholics or the...the Presbyterians.

635
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,940
Actually, the Presbyterians have...are...you know, kind of lively.

636
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,600
Do they have rituals?

637
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,760
What are their rituals?

638
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,640
The tonguers are my favorite, of course.

639
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,040
The whaters?

640
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,860
The tonguers. Those are the ones that speak in tongues.

641
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, the tonguers.

642
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
They have many different types of tongues.

643
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,460
That's what the other Christian nuts who aren't quite as crazy as the tonguers call the tonguers.

644
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,140
Those are the folks who put the pits in the cream cheese?

645
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,160
I had a guy tell me...he was telling me about the tonguers.

646
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,640
He was going...they're just crazy.

647
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,020
He'd just suddenly start talking these nonsense.

648
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,160
They're going to go to hell.

649
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,000
You know, they're going to have to answer to God for that.

650
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,140
And then he told me about Jamaicans.

651
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,340
He goes, I was going out to Jamaica.

652
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,560
That is great religion, though.

653
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,000
That is right.

654
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,880
You know what those men do?

655
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
They put cow dung in their hair.

656
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,300
They put cow dung in their hair.

657
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,160
And they said to me...

658
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,260
They're going to have to answer to God for that.

659
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,920
I just see these Jamaican guys standing in front of God.

660
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't you think that's kind of strange?

661
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,380
Explaining the cow dung in their hair.

662
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,240
And God goes, cool.

663
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,980
Yeah, I think God would love a rastaman.

664
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,820
And then God would go, you know what?

665
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,020
I already knew that because I'm you and that cow dung.

666
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
I thought John was a rastaman.

667
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,260
And they'll go, man, that's what I was hoping.

668
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,160
I was hoping that there was an answer, that it was true and good and right.

669
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,140
And you are me and you are the rastaman.

670
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,080
And I'm the cow dung and we're all one and we're all together.

671
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,860
Praise God!

672
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,840
I think I'd like to live in a world where that cow dung can not only talk and not only

673
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,540
make the stations of the cross, but can also dance like Carl Simargo.

674
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,520
You remember that guy?

675
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
I think he had a...

676
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
What are you guys on?

677
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,720
What are we not on?

678
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,000
What is it on?

679
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,840
It's a plane that we can all achieve by simply colding our concentration.

680
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,800
At our navels.

681
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,160
Simply think of the spot one inch from the end of the tip of your nose.

682
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Now place that spot at the end of the tip of your nose down at the tip of your navel.

683
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,520
Hold your concentration at the end of the tip of your nose and to your navel for approximately five minutes.

684
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,280
While not looking at your watch.

685
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,780
Making sure to count slowly, breathing through your ears.

686
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:21,900
One.

687
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,640
Breathe out through your eyes.

688
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,820
In through your ears.

689
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,960
In through your eyes.

690
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,140
In through your eyes.

691
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,000
Now everything you've heard you will smell and you will see everything you've heard after you smell it.

692
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,720
Now when the navel is calmed, think of the navel as the entire center of the universe.

693
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,840
Larry.

694
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,320
Larry curly curly mo mo.

695
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:58,140
I would like to transplant a few of you wonderful people.

696
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,800
I am totally fine.

697
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:58,800


698
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm a little bit of a bummer.

699
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,760
I've met here on earth in my short brief stay in your world.

700
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,680
The Christ, a cowboy friend of mine.

701
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,580
We played wood chips together and stocked ourselves full of the latest stockings and cooperated.

702
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,500
That's the key word here.

703
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,240
Cooperation.

704
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,800
And you, I remember you the day they nailed you to the solar helix.

705
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Let me in, she cried.

706
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,340
Let me out, he cried.

707
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,600
Sex jam.

708
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,160
Sex jam.

709
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:38,940
New from Paranoid Picks, Legs Lex and Polyhuman Fig are underage in sex jam.

710
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,900
She was trapped by her wanton way of life, always wanton something.

711
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,580
He was trapped by her, a smart cookie about to be singed.

712
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,780
Lex, listen to me.

713
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,140
Together we can be a team, just you and me.

714
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,860
Together, I'll kill you.

715
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,420
I love you, baby.

716
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,620
Excuse me, honey.

717
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,260
I love you, too.

718
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,760
Sex jail!

719
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,920
Sex jail!

720
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,980
For singles only, admitted in pairs,

721
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,440
don't let anyone know the awful beginning of this terrible drama.

722
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,540
Don't watch!

723
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,740
This film is rated 4X for medicinal purposes only.

724
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,880
Don't watch!

725
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,120
Twin seals will be in the aisles for every performance.

726
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,780
And remember, absolutely no one will be permitted to leave the screening of...

727
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,100
Sex jail!

728
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,820
Sex jail!

729
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,300
So they said, okay, let's put all this stuff in a warehouse.

730
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,560
We'll deliver it to people.

731
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,460
And then we'll charge them more.

732
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,020
But people won't pay more.

733
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,700
The people will laugh.

734
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,080
Not enough of them will pay more.

735
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:11,820
Yeah.

736
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,060
That's the problem.

737
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,780
Well, I would...

738
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,720
But isn't it great having...

739
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,240
When Webvan was working, it was great having them bring food to your house.

740
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,280
Now, you know, I always thought there would be two signs.

741
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,560
If we were really in the future, there would be two signs of it.

742
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,340
You would have flying cars and you would have food replicators

743
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,920
where you could just push a button and the appropriate food would just be replicated.

744
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,940
Not really replicated.

745
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,960
It would be, like, transported from some place where the perfect food was grown,

746
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:50,220
none of which was tainted by any horrible substances or illegal insecticides and things.

747
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,740
And then we would be able to eat wonderful food for free.

748
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,520
And then we would get into our flying cars

749
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,840
and fly to the movies.

750
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,860
And then we would fly to our jobs where we would only have to work one minute a week.

751
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,060
And at that time, we would just push a giant button.

752
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,220
We would come to work at about lunch hour.

753
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,380
We'd push the big button and then we would go home.

754
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,940
We'd do that once a week and they'd pay us a million dollars a minute to do that.

755
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
It's like a Warner Brothers cartoon.

756
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,880
Hi, I'm the Everly Brothers and in our business, we hear a lot of talk about drugs.

757
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,180
The heavy message now is that speed kills.

758
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,820
It refers to a good...

759
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,860
...group of drugs called antipetamins, including OPS, PEP pills, MAP, DEX, even VENY's.

760
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,260
You've seen what speed drugs can do.

761
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,020
They're dangerous, much too dangerous to fool around with.

762
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,980
To find out more about drugs, go to National Institute of Medical Health

763
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,600
or the Adventist Box 101 in Washington, D.C.

764
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,180
Don't get smug, you'll be in the back of the...

765
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,840
Drop it or I'll break your arm.

766
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,220
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.

767
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,260
And there...

768
00:33:59,260 --> 00:33:59,920
Oh, look!

769
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,140
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.

770
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,280
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

771
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,680
Ridiculous.

772
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,440
She was terrified and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car is sitting in the garage.

773
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,340
She was out or in bed with the flu or maybe she was abducted by aliens for all we know.

774
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:26,980
I'm calling.

775
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm calling.

776
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,100
The alien pees in the bushes.

777
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,800
He staggers.

778
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,340
His behavior is erotic and erratic.

779
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,340
He can't focus.

780
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,000
Yes, he is.

781
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,420
She's lonely.

782
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,020
Just see the démons speak.

783
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,340
That's tamam.

784
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,500
Pipes and liceackes or logs and snowmen.

785
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,640
They are just

786
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:10,860
minding their own business as artists do.

787
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


788
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


789
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860

Sorry.

796
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,580
Try to talk.

797
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,300
the benefit of this long range zoom.

798
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,600
We can zoom in on the hideous, hideous, foul demon that he is.

799
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,000
Like some movie, horrible, horrible movie creature.

800
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,100
There he is, just sort of walking.

801
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,020
Yeah, I think they walk.

802
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,320
And then they creep, creepily creeping away.

803
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,400
What?

804
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,880
An ID?

805
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Who is that?

806
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,600
He wants my ID!

807
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,360
Somebody came in the room here and asked for my ID.

808
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,520
Peter Paul Bergman.

809
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,360
ER.

810
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,100
EOR.

811
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,960
EOR now.

812
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,340
Come on, come on, Mr. X.

813
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,940
Come on, Citizen X.

814
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
You want me to say the letters of this station?

815
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,820
Yeah, you know what they are.

816
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,540
All of my literary life, if I might have just a moment to speak.

817
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,220
Citizen X.

818
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,120
Citizen X.

819
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,200
Citizen X.

820
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,420
Citizen X.

821
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,420


822
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,540
Citizen X.

823
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:34,900
Citizen X.

829
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,160
Citizen X.

830
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,460
Citizen X!

831
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:52,680


832
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:52,680


833
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:52,700
Citizen X.

834
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:52,700


835
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:52,720

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:52,720


837
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:52,720

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:52,720


839
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,380
Citizen X.

840
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,840
I'll hire Harry, what's that guy?

841
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,380
I can't remember.

842
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,020
Harry Cobra.

843
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,620
Yeah.

844
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,320
Harry Von Zell.

845
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,120
I had some great camera angles planned for this week's show, too.

846
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,300
You did?

847
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,060
We were going to shoot up through a glass table.

848
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah?

849
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,620
Yeah, we were going to do a couple of shots shooting directly down through a rotating fan.

850
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,720
No, no, no.

851
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,220
Yeah, it was going to be another great issue of Dragnet, and you messed it all up.

852
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:22,880
Oh, you weren't going to have a shot of him sitting in a white shirt in a slightly overstuffed chair in a hunting lodge waiting for the lemon duck to get finished in the...

853
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,940
I remember that.

854
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,600
I can't forget it.

855
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,680
Dragnet finally no longer scared me when they were sitting there.

856
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
When do you think the duck's going to be ready?

857
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,200
I don't know.

858
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,740
When do you think the duck's going to be shot?

859
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,680
I don't know.

860
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,740
What are we going to do sitting here in a hunting lodge?

861
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,420
Two cops.

862
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,380
What are we going to do?

863
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,560
No, they were in Ed's apartment or whoever his partner is, Harry.

864
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,460
That's right, Harry.

865
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,440
When do you think...

866
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,160
When's the duck ready, Harry?

867
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,340
I don't know.

868
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,640
Joe.

869
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,180
Joe Friday?

870
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,340
Yeah, Joe Friday.

871
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,580
I don't know, Joe.

872
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,240
My wife gave me this recipe over here.

873
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,240
Let me take a look.

874
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,480
Oh, you better take a look now.

875
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
They do it like...

876
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:01,760
Hey, Joe.

877
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,540
You better take a look now.

878
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:02,860
Yeah.

879
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,520
Hey, Joe.

880
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:03,860
Yeah, Harry.

881
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,740
I took a look at the recipe.

882
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,400
Yeah, so you took a look at the recipe.

883
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,580
You know what it says, Joe?

884
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,420
Well, no.

885
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,240
What does it say, Harry?

886
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,060
It says we got to wait another hour.

896
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,620
It's not crawling

897
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:39,620


898
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,720
Listen, listen.

899
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
It's not a very bad movie

900
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,040


901
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:43,900
But...

902
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,680
Ted is shrinking.

903
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,040
He's in pain.

904
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,940
He can't stand living another second.

905
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,440
He must kill himself to relieve himself of such horrible, horrible pain and agony.

906
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,180
People thought negative art was just a trend.

907
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,320
But then it raced back with all the vengeance of shadow mastery.

908
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,800
I thought I would be able to find my way home.

909
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,700
But now it seems I'm just wandering.

910
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,660
Is that really you, or is that like a space suit in your inside someplace?

911
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,340
Maybe just your brain in a little jar or something like that?

912
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,080
Here it is straight.

913
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,980
One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.

914
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,580
Don't look at me like that.

915
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,500
These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is,

916
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,180
it's a prehistoric thing, and do you laugh, I'll brain you,

917
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,300
is romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.

918
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,820
A monster. How can she love a monster?

919
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,520
Let's get that through your head.

920
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,460
You dried up monster.

921
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,080
We've been hearing the sexual stuff for years.

922
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,680
You know, the five-day orgasm.

923
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,140
It all happens without physical contact.

924
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,600
It's only the beginning.

925
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,880
Why should this reality be public domain?

926
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,840
What's so great about it?

927
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Maybe they gave you some drugs.

928
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,380
Maybe none of this is real at all.

929
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,260
He's going into shock.

930
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,400
Yeah, this is the one thing you don't think about on the show.

931
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,140
Oh.

932
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,140
Give him the allergen.

933
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,780
Get him the allergen.

934
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,580
Well, you lower down those plastic curtains.

935
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
You can't tell what's real and what isn't.

936
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,020
Lower yourselves into the caller's brain.

937
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,540
Okay, speak now,

938
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,740
or forever hold the little pieces that are left on the floor

939
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,660
of your shattered heart.

940
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,560
My pain.

941
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,640
On the surface, in casual conversation.

942
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,540
Yes.

943
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,600
Their beard is all gray.

944
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,600
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,420
They just seem like normal guys.

946
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,220
Want to trade me the rest of the peanuts, banana?

947
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,200
They remain a dangerous choice.

948
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple of bananas.

949
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,740
Absolutely.

950
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,700
I've done it before.

951
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm giving you great input.

952
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Thanks for the input.

953
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,640
Yeah.

954
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,600
We have to put it in somewhere.

955
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,220
Oh.

956
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,020
Might as well be here.

957
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,420
That's good.

958
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,640
Doctors taught me a lot about dealing with tension.

959
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,680
Yeah.

960
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,060
That's just.

961
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,300
Here we go.

962
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,660
No, not tense, are you, doctor?

Mr. Keschner, can you tell us about, by golly, this is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

From PR News in Washington, I'm expected to run out of money today as part of a stopgap measure.

You could start to feel the.

1082
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,440
One in which.

1083
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,880
Those are just regular feelings.

1084
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,900
One that the common alien has to experience.

1085
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,840
And he sees them as fun.

1086
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,220
In fact, if he were here to experience fun, it would seem like pain to him.

1087
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,920
And there he is with his hideous, hideous, foul, fetid, smelly face.

1088
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,540
And foul body fungus.

1089
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,600
And.

1090
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,980
Hideous excretions and ejecta vomitoid.

1091
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,300
Vroom spaskak hantashahai.

1092
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:25,400
And he falls backwards into the mists of hideosity and ludicrosity.

1093
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:31,400
From which he, the spawn of evil pain and suffering, damnation and horror.

1094
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,480
Comes forth.

1095
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,580
And never before revealed.

1096
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,300
Springtacular negatvergo art.

1097
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,660
Negative art.

1098
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,500
Yes, negative art.

1099
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,200
It's a new art form sweeping the nation.

1100
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,360
Only two people have mastered it so far.

1101
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,280
Puzzling evidence of being one of them.

1102
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:03,060
And there, the hideous alien is trying to shield himself from our, our non-stop relentless camera.

1103
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,520
Our camera cannot stop shooting in close range.

1104
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,940
Even a 12andMe will move in aumento point and peak into a

1105
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,000
six-inch level on fanché television, topping screen for a period of between an hour and

1106
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,000


1107
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,480
What a face.

1108
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:21,480


1109
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:21,600
This isriv.

1110
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,340
So it just goes.

1111
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,340


1112
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,760
Has the door generate inspiration?

1113
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,620
No.

1114
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,460
Just.

1115
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,100
Telephone I like to try it out here. I just plug it in the wall

1116
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,940
Generally used to fill in the gap or at the end of exit speeches to carry the actor

1117
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,820
All right is dick there sure I can wait you have anything hello

1118
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,400
Hello, dick. Yeah, listen. I'm back. It's Clayton

1119
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,180
And I got some very good news for you

1120
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:14,200
Yeah, I was able to go through with the initial planning. They're all behind us. They don't have anything down there

1121
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,240
No, no, we'll probably be able to set them up with all sorts of you know signs and things

1122
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,940
I only trouble is in the copyrights

1123
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,180
Liggett and Myers has a copyright to the one we were trying to get the others

1124
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,500
I think we can get hold of without any trouble

1125
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:42,860
And we'll be able to spring it on the unsuspecting public as soon as we can brainwash them into believing it won't hurt them

1126
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:49,800
Now I know that there's a lot of hard work in this and I know a spiral has been work

1127
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,320
He's been on my golf course

1128
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,680
He hit who in the back of the head

1129
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,740
with a golf ball

1130
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:05,440
Okay, what are we going to do fantastic listen also? There's some some some stuff that I

1131
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,760
Think we should look into because somebody put some of it in an olive I had in a martini recently

1132
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,440
And it had an interesting effect which I think could push the American public right into the 70s

1133
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,720
So we ought to look into bottling it. Yeah, right

1134
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,900
Yeah, it's the stuff that your daughter took the night of the big ball. Remember she danced circles around everybody

1135
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,880
We didn't think she'd ever drop her but she did okay Dickie look

1136
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,020
I got to get off now because the phone is running out and and I'll talk to you next week

1137
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,380
I'm gonna go down there again and see if I can't put something together. This is Clayton rum cake over

1138
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,440
The creature emerge from

1139
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,580
The horror and the suffering that he

1140
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,200
Experiences in just the sheer existence in this horrible world

1141
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,980
In which the suffering souls of an agony feed off of the horror and the pain of every living creature around them

1142
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,140
It's so bad

1143
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:22,080
People hate it. They thought about making a law against this world, but I didn't know how to get to it

1144
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,980
And now here you are

1145
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,440
through the scientific

1146
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,320
advancement of negative part

1147
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,340
You can now see this hideous creature. Oh my god. He's coming close

1148
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,480
Oh, oh, oh, no

1149
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,320
Started 1 million forgotten BC monsters

1150
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,820
Monsters have taken over the interface once again and I and mr. Spook are helpless

1151
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,500
You know, it is a requested not to throw coffee into the basin

1152
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,640
Irritating captain the sensors have eliminated all the blue passages from my sex

1153
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,060
poking that big nose

1154
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,940
and the things okay color you

1155
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,940
know who that knows is quite I think to see what the size of my nose has to do with the problem that

1156
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,980
We are you can be like the queen on sex plan. It makes you constantly comment on it

1157
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,560
I think it's just sighs do it. I forget, you know, I didn't ever didn't watch Star Trek so I don't know all the different

1158
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,720
What is it about my?

1159
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,040
constantly brings great attention

1160
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,420
Vader was on Star last you will make you know that your nose is in front to all decent Earth's

1161
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,380
Man, that's what you keep telling me. Are you out of your Vulcan mind spook?

1162
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:47,600
He doesn't have a mind right is that the joke a mind is a terrible thing

1163
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,160
When the baby is done drinking it must be

1164
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,000
late in a cool place under a tap

1165
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,460
It's cheesy nut butter is the cause of the aliens and I'm sorry

1166
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:04,060
I just I think I just sat on the racist peanut butter cups. Oh, you did that on purpose. I saw you

1167
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,860
Just so I can have the build the body figured out my

1168
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,960
To boldly split infinitives where no one has done that before

1169
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,440
Boys to see what's on the base the final frontier and then a bunch of

1170
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,300
Stars for jeans are the voyages of the starship KPFA

1171
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,720
It's continuing

1172
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,180
mission to boldly explore

1173
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,400
To smash up the entire

1174
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,720
break everything

1175
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,160
Entire studio, it's a monster that comes out in the talk so some monsters a Kirk

1176
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,900
Every week there's a Kirk ship pitches and rolls

1177
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,100
Here's a harder one

1178
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,640
puzzling evidence from KPFA Berkeley before that lots of rare fire sign theater and ESO's

1179
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,960
Swamp radio merged with our of slack from WCSB Cleveland year 2001

1180
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:17,080
But now some historical material in a short clip from sandy boons award-winning feature-length documentary film

1181
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,600
J.r. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the subgenius on the origins of the book of the subgenius

1182
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:29,620
The voices heard include dr. Philo Drummond to hell Swami satellite weavers also known as John Hagen Brenner

1183
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,200
Dr. Hal Robbins Penn Gillette Nick Oberman

1184
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,680
but the stage presenter to help us through the next clip in the books is a

1185
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,040
Nolan's

1186
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,960
I really didn't know he would benas

1187
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,240
He is now

1188
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,060
issit

1189
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,180
The film was made 2 years ago

1190
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,840
Not released in 2005

1191
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,480
To yn

1192
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,520
went to a picnic with a bunch of other people in the publishing business, and a young man

1193
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:04,180
named Tim McGinnis, who was a brand new editor at McGraw-Hill, found this smudged pamphlet on the

1194
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,360
floor of her car. He goes, where'd this come from? She goes, that was my crazy brother-in-law.

1195
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,200
He and his buddy did this. He goes, I want to get in touch with him and tell him to get an agent.

1196
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,960
The next thing we knew, Simon & Schuster, McGraw-Hill, and Macmillan were all bidding on

1197
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:29,460
the Book of the Subgenius, which caused the asking price to go up to $20,000. That was enough to pay

1198
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:36,080
Paul Mavridis and John Hagenbrenner to do professional design on it. Doug brought in

1199
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:43,720
hand-scrawled manuscripts and, you know, packets of clip art and stuff that he wanted included.

1200
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,440
So, you know, I'd take a chapter and I'd paste it up. I'd generate some original material.

1201
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:57,820
John's style was perfect because it kind of matched the clip art. When McGraw-Hill first

1202
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:03,880
released it, some places we could find it in the religion section, and I thought that was a huge

1203
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,480
win. We got a contract for a book, we got it in the stores, and it's in the religion section

1204
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,800
instead of the comedy section. It's not next to Doonesbury, it's next to the Bible and stuff.

1205
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,800
People go, man, I barely made it through high school. But I stumbled upon your book,

1206
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:28,380
and I realized I'm not the only one. I got that book. I read it beginning to end.

1207
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:36,500
I absorbed that book. I adored that book. I loved that book. They kept me with, I get this,

1208
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,460
I get this, I get this, I understand it. This is directly from my heart.

1209
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,620
What the f*** are you talking about?

1210
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,480
No idea what this is.

1211
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:52,340
This is the word of Almighty Bob. It's the roadmap. There is no other book like this book.

1212
00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:03,280
It was these older, wiser miscreants letting us know that indeed all of these human-made

1213
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,660
organizational systems are as flawed as you suspect because they're made by us.

1214
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,920
I was thinking it would be fun to have the Celebrity Square,

1215
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,680
the

1216
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,260
the subject be esoteric subgenius concepts.

1217
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,980
Yeah, yeah.

1218
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,100
So like the story of Bob being shot could be part of that.

1219
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,500
Well, so many things could be. That's a great idea because it's

1220
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:32,400
mining the ancient depths of subgenius. Some of the origination myths rather than these newer church things.

1221
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,200
But they would be brought out in a playful,

1222
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,520
fundamental way.

1223
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,620
And we could really dig,

1224
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,020
as I do sometimes when I find these old tapes and listen to some of the old jokes of the old church,

1225
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,920
and I think they're just fun to dig up again.

1226
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,480
That was P. Bicker Fleamouse and the Cajun country band.

1227
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:57,020
And I just want to throw in some of the old jokes so people know there was a little old church and these little guys limped around the little campfire at night.

1228
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,180
By cranky, it was better back then.

1229
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,380
Yeah, did their religious thing and said as people always do universally,

1230
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,240
it was better back then because you know folks it was better back then.

1231
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,980
Sure it was.

1232
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,680
No matter who you were or where you were in history, it was always better back then.

1233
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,000
Because there was more youth. That's what I was thinking.

1234
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,060
And less withering from time being blasted by grief and ill usage.

1235
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,000
That's right.

1236
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:33,320
So now let the myrmidons of chicken infuse energy into the show while we, the elder archons, simply lap up the cream provided on the occasion.

1237
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:33,720
Oh, absolutely.

1238
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,980
By the creamettes and the other performing groups.

1239
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,060
They are also referred to as naked fire goddesses by chicken.

1240
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:43,520
Oh, I love that.

1241
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:43,980
I love that.

1242
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,380
I don't know what the deal is there.

1243
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:45,600
Who cares?

1244
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,600
I mean, he's claiming that that...

1245
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:56,000
They'll just fit in just fine to the subgenius mythology of saucers and pleasure guides and...

1246
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,980
All that stuff.

1247
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,820
All that stuff that they pay 10 bucks to come see.

1248
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,160
That's right.

1249
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,540
Dinosaurs of slack.

1250
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,920
All your favorites doing all the same things over and over again.

1251
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,180
That's 13 bucks.

1252
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,500
That's Jesus at subgenius.com.

1253
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,980
If you want to know about subgenius, go to subgenius.com.

1254
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,380
You can get your salvation or your $275.

1255
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,680
It's Jesus at subgenius.com.

1256
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,640
Yeah, it's not Chaz.

1257
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,360
It's ESO radio.

1258
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,920
It's ESO swamp radio.

1259
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,620
And it's not Reverend Stagg at the hour of slack.

1260
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,040
And it ain't lonesome cowboy to involve himself out there in the fray.

1261
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,820
It's you.

1262
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,120
It's you and me.

1263
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,660
You and Zoro and Bob Nye in between you and Bob.

1264
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,980
You don't need an intermediary of a priest or a preacher.

1265
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,740
I'm sorry.

1266
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,420
You don't need a preacher.

1267
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,620
You just need Bob.

1268
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,980
You don't need Reverend Stagg.

1269
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,500
You don't need Ken Schilling.

1270
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,780
You don't need the bank.

1271
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,560
You don't need the ambulance.

1272
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,720
You don't need the antidote.

1273
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,220
You only need one thing.

1274
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,740
That's Bob.

1275
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,500
And a little frock, probably.

1276
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,700
And, uh...

1277
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,620
When God come back on a happy Easter's day,

1278
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,600
and it carries a lace around the flowers,

1279
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,260
and everybody pukes on his head...

1280
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,620
He's still talking over there.

1281
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,820
Ivan Stagg can talk forever.

1282
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,180
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying.

1283
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,560
Bringing the word to the bed-nighted, Ethan.

1284
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,240
I want you to check a box next to each one of these that's a true statement.

1285
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,240
Let's go get fresh eggs, ham, and bacon.

1286
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,960
A true statement.

1287
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,600
I salivate at the sight of mittens.

1288
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,460
True or false?

1289
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,200
Garlic.

1290
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,440
My father was a good woman.

1291
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,340
True or false?

1292
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,060
A little salsa in there.

1293
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,140
Yeah.

1294
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,700
My mother dresses me funny.

1295
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,480
True or false?

1296
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,880
I believe in an afterbirth.

1297
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,320
True or false?

1298
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,140
This is a subgenius quiz.

1299
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,060
I often lie to make myself obnoxious.

1300
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,440
True or false?

1301
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,640
I prefer spiders to lima beans.

1302
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,760
Spiders?

1303
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,140
Did you make spiders?

1304
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,600
I think you're most likely dead, John.

1305
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,580
Often I think I am a special agent.

1306
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,960
I can talk forever.

1307
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,040
But shan't.

1308
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:21,000
And all there is left for you to know is at subgenius.com and much of it's right there on the home page.

1309
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,440
And now a word from our sponsor.

1310
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,960
The preceding portion of this program was brought to you by Schleicher beer.

1311
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,580
Remember, Schleicher beer is better than Nordlander.

1312
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,100
Either that or if I really get serious I can put on two hours of people listening to show.

1313
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,120
Yeah, people listening.

1314
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,680
Just people listening to radio.

1315
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,320
Sure, yeah.

1316
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,000
People.

1317
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,420
Two hours.

1318
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,160
People, yeah.

1319
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,400
It's easy for you to say.

1320
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,780
Did they say that?

1321
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,140
Putting people, people listening on.

1322
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,660
Putting people.

1323
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,760
Putting people first.

1324
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,980
If you put people listening on, nobody, I mean it's going to be kind of boring.

1325
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,340
People are just going to be listening to people listening.

1326
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,100
And it's sort of like.

1327
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:00,960
Well, like Dear Friends.

1328
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,860
I think, yeah, it was on the Pacific Island.

1329
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,680
Like right now.

1330
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,460
Dear Friends, which is just what we're doing right now.

1331
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,940
In the Pacific Ocean.

1332
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,800
And I believe Gary listened to the original.

1333
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,260
Fire Science Theater doing just yacking.

1334
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,860
About listening.

1335
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:13,740
Yeah.

1336
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,020
And about listening.

1337
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,100
About all the stuff we do.

1338
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,840
It's interesting to think about listening to someone listening.

1339
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,720
It's sort of like thinking about thinking.

1340
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,300
In one way, you know.

1341
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,660
It is.

1342
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,500
In one way, yeah.

1343
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,560
In one way it is.

1344
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,040
In the fact that it's.

1345
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,840
It is in one way.

1346
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,640
In another way it's absolutely unrelated.

1347
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,340
It's sort of like, it's stupid to even think about them as being related in another way.

1348
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,220
Well, it's stupid to think about it.

1349
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,860
You don't even waste time thinking about them being related.

1350
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,740
It's stupid.

1351
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,340
Why would you do that with your life?

1352
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:43,640
Stupid.

1353
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,300
Don't be so stupid.

1354
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,920
To think they were related.

1355
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,420
That's coming up, isn't it?

1356
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,140
St. Stupid's Day.

1357
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Well, not for some time.

1358
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,120
I don't know why that's in April.

1359
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,600
Hey, Hal.

1360
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,760
I can dream my dream.

1361
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,980
Hey, everything's coming up.

1362
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,760
I can dream my dream.

1363
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760
