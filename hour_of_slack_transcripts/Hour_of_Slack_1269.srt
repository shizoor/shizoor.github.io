1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:15,740
The subgenius of the slack.

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,160
Have you been smoking, Stan?

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,340
Yep, yep.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,380
Shh.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,680
Don't tell anyone.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,760
You know, you really shouldn't.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,740
It's unpredictable and it could affect your medication.

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,420
Better win their prescription.

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,120
All I know is the world looks beautiful.

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,860
The world looks so damn beautiful.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,140
I feel fantastic.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,200
And I never felt as good as how I do right now.

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,600
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,160
When I felt the way that I do right now.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,860
Right now.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,780
I feel fantastic.

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,780
And I never felt as good as how I do right now.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,200
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,760
When I felt the way that I do right now.

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,560
Right now.

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,400
Right now.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,980
Work is anything but quiet these days

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,420
I try to mitigate my concentration haze

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,320
I can see the day unfold in front of me

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,140
So I take the stairs and hit the gym

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,620
The phone is ringing when I get to my desk

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,940
Well, plus the stinging's now a sharp pain in my chest

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,640
So I take a call to next and just chill

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,660
And then it's time for lunch again

30
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,860
All I know is work is easy

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,880
When you don't stress out about deadlines

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,760
All I know is to take my medicine

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,560
I always take my medicine

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,780
I feel fantastic

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
And I never felt as good as how I do right now

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,220
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,380
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,500
I feel fantastic

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,400
And I never felt as good as how I do right now

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,100
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,180
Right now

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,620
Sometimes I'd like a slur

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,740
From a friend to some old friend

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:27,740


46
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm going to take a pill for my social anxiety.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,760
I get a table and a nice bottle of Chablis.

48
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,740
Now it's getting late and there's still no sign of her.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,600
I have another glass of wine.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
All I know is the wine lasts longer when you don't got to share it with someone.

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,620
All I know is the steak tastes better when I take my steak tastes better pill.

52
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,600
I feel fantastic and I never felt as good as how I do right now.

53
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,040
Except for maybe when I think about how I felt that day.

54
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,520
When I felt the way that I do right now.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,240
Right now.

56
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
I feel fantastic.

57
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,860
And I never felt as good as how I do right now.

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,640
Except for maybe when I think about how I felt that day.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
When I felt the way that I do right now.

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,940
Right now.

61
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,820
Right now.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,180
Where, where, it's through.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
Just, it's happening.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,560
Wow.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,440
There's nothing spooky about it.

66
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,680
This is, I know exactly how it is.

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,060
That's right.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,540
That's how it is.

69
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,340
That's how it is.

70
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,980
Heart Ignition cut that last little piece.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,000
And the happy song, I Feel Fantastic was by JoCo.

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,780
That's our man Jonathan Coulton at JonathanCoulton.com.

73
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,400
Princess Wee can sing along with all of his songs.

74
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,980
This show, due partly to the contributions this month,

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,860
seems to be a little bit more than just a little bit.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
It's going to be a drug abuse themed episode.

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,060
That happens every now and then with this show.

78
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm also still gradually editing through the recordings from 13X Day Drill.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
That is a daunting task, friends.

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,760
But I'm starting to unearth some of the best ofs.

81
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,500
And that's what I'll strive to structure this and future shows around.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,260
Le Mar did the titles.

83
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,860
And The Lard did the titles.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
And George did the next cut.

85
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,000
And there'll be more from them.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
And Fat Man D and Monkey Hive.

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
And Reverend Janus.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,640
And even Crazy Jim Jones.

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,520
All from 13X Day Drill recordings.

90
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,880
And there will be old Rudy Schwartz Project.

91
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,920
And yes, even new Devo.

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,280
Let there also be Slack.

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,100
For an emergent high like me, friends,

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,460
Slack is going at it so hard that you just about like to burst that vein in your forehead.

95
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:38,780
And here then is something that unexpectedly happened at 13X Day when I got good and fed up.

96
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,960
You'll hear Reverend Angry Larry and Dr. Philo Drummond trying to defuse me.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,320
We might, since we know how to use computers, maybe do a Jonestown thing or something.

98
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,960
Do a what?

99
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,240
A Jonestown.

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,420
Oh no, that was years ago.

101
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,320
That was years ago.

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,580
But the thought was there.

103
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,000
The thought was there, so yeah.

104
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,660
It wasn't the pagans that burned that Dobbs icon.

105
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,660
It was the power of J.R. Bob Dobbs that burned that goddamn Dobbs icon.

106
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,100
And he did that so that you bastards would stay up here and keep playing.

107
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,580
So that's all there is to it.

108
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,080
You can dress it up.

109
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,340
You can purty it up all you want.

110
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm sorry if I might offend.

111
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm sorry if I might offend the tender ears of some liberals, the book learning subtenuuses,

112
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,500
the ones that memorize the pre-scriptures but don't know what they really say.

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,340
Well maybe I'm going to make you mad when I say it was the power of J.R. Bob Dobbs that did that thing.

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,960
It was not Connie Dobbs.

115
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,640
It was not Reverend Ivan Stanglers.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,120
It was not Dr. Philo Drummond.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,920
It was the power of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,260
And Bob alone that did that thing.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,820
No.

120
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,600
And Bob wants to thank God.

121
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,780
It's going to be done.

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,520
And he did it.

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
I think it was Dick Dobbs.

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,280
It was not Dick Dobbs that did it.

125
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,820
It was not Nege.

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,840
It was not the Yucca Tisma.

127
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,040
It was not you or you or me or nobody but Bob.

128
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,200
Why can't you trust?

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
And have faith?

130
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,880
If Bob wants to happen, it's what's going to happen anyway and that's all there is to it.

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,340
Now be careful Reverend Stang.

132
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,480
You might pop that nodule in your neck.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,560
You know what happened last time?

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
You popped that nodule in your neck.

135
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,440
Look, I was only saying that we didn't want to spray the pagans down with WD-40 and light them on fire.

136
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,700
I was just sticking up for them.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,660
I said that.

138
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,420
So the DJ event starts in five minutes.

139
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,780
I was saying no.

140
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,760
Because they look out for us.

141
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,100
I don't care if I understood what you said or not.

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm still going to preach and worry about it.

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,740
We got, yeah, five minutes until the DJ event.

144
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,060
It's one hour to my bedtime.

145
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,660
If you will make your way to the 808 camp which is located in the middle of the field.

146
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,900
It should be a big black tarp with a bunch of noise getting ready to head out of it.

147
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,120
That's what you, Reverend Ivan Stang.

148
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,040
What do you believe?

149
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you really believe this bomb joke?

150
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,980
Do you people really believe this crazy UFO bomb joke?

151
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,540
What?

152
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,160
They go Reverend Ivan Stang.

153
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,740
What do you really truly in your heart really believe in?

154
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,820
You got to believe in something.

155
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,500
I believe I'm going to go up and get myself another beer.

156
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,300
Praise Bob.

157
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,360
Praise Bob.

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,140
Praise Bob.

159
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,980
Praise Bob.

160
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,900
Praise Bob.

161
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,800
Praise Bob.

162
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,640
Praise Bob.

163
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,500
Praise Bob.

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,360
Praise Bob.

165
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,120
I am a human rocket,

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,180
on a mission of deployment.

167
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,660
I've been cocked and loaded,

168
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,860
ready for the culmination.

169
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,280
I am a human missile,

170
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,460
guided by secret gender,

171
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,100
that commands my every thoughts and deeds.

172
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,040
That wills me on my way.

173
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,160
I am a human rocket

174
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,360
On a mission of redemption

175
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,780
I've been fucking loaded

176
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,940
Right by everything I know

177
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,400
I am a human missile

178
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,580
Guided by a secret voice

179
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,960
That commands my every action

180
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,140
And wheels me on my way

181
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,720
There is no turning back

182
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,600
There are no second thoughts

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,360
First things first and all things fair

184
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,100
We love the war they say

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,860
There is no planning me

186
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,160
On the land, in the air, or on the sea

187
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,180
This is what's supposed to be

188
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,440
My duty now awaits me

189
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,420
I am a human rocket

190
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,580
On a mission of instruction

191
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,980
I've been primed and programmed

192
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,120
Since the beginning of time

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,520
I am a human missile

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,780
Guided by a secret master

195
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,080
That commands my every motion

196
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,580
I am a human missile

197
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,340
And wheels me on my way

198
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,700
I found my target

199
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,880
I reached my coordinates

200
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,580
I'm set to detonate

201
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,480
And resonate

202
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,780
The final poem I will create

203
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,380
I made a video

204
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,300
It tells a story, oh

205
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
I guess it's time to go

206
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,260
Don't forget to rewind

207
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,740
I am a human rocket

208
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,940
On a mission of destruction

209
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,380
I've been locked and loaded

210
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,220
And ready for the confirmation

211
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,980
I am a human missile

212
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,020
Guided by a secret perfection

213
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,200
That commands my full conviction

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,660
And wheels me on my way

215
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,800
Large parts of the interior

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
Will go by

217
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,060
I've noticed we are all distracted

218
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,240
By the lights and sounds

219
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
Of everything and nothing

220
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,040
Do you remember the breath you took

221
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,660
When they left you off the hook

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,800
And sent you swimming away

223
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,780
Back into your cell?

224
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,040
I am a human rocket

225
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,340
On a mission of instruction

226
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,580
I've been cocked and loaded

227
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,340
Since the dawn of time

228
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,120
I am a human missile

229
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,380
Guided by a secret voice

230
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,280
That commands my every motion

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,040
It's time to speak

232
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,200
And loose me up

233
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,700
A righteous way

234
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,420
McFarland

235
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,840
McFarland

236
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,260
I really do

237
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
I really do

238
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,220
I know you've had a swirling torment of anti-slack around you of late.

239
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,460
And I really do.

240
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,960
You know, I've got to tell you something.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,100
You know, I know in the heart of my heart that you need healing.

242
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
You need some healing.

243
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,240
You need to feel that slack within you.

244
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,280
And before you ray it, I need to heal you.

245
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,840
I need to heal you and make sure that your precious, precious soul is ready

246
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
for 7 a.m.

247
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,820
Oh, bless your little heart.

248
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,040
So be healed!

249
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,500
Be healed!

250
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,200
All right.

251
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,060
I don't know if I'm going to be able to top that.

252
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm not naturally in doubt.

253
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,260
Never you mind.

254
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,900
I came into this church, and by that I mean money was exchanged.

255
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,560
And when I saw a rant by the good Dr. Legume,

256
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,320
and literally before the end of the video,

257
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,380
I was typing in my credit card number into the lovely subgenius website.

258
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,540
Yes, praise the credit card number.

259
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,600
Now, what he was talking about, not my credit card number, thankfully.

260
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,380
Well, what he was talking about was the nature of subgenius heaven.

261
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,240
For those of us misfortunate enough to shuffle this mortal coil

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,880
before the saucers happened to get here.

263
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,640
What did this have to do with Legume?

264
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,380
That was his rant!

265
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
That was his particular rant, and it was beautiful.

266
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,040
It touched me in all the wrong and the such right places.

267
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,300
But what he forgot to mention was that,

268
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,700
in heaven, there is no bacon.

269
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,700
Not subgenius heaven, friends.

270
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
Not subgenius heaven.

271
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,380
In subgenius heaven, you can find all the bacon you want.

272
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,060
In the bacon plains of porktonia.

273
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,580
Not to be confused with the porktonian plains of bacon.

274
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
That's an entirely different show.

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,120
Now, there is no bacon in heaven, of course,

276
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,640
because heaven is run by pigs.

277
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,560
Fat, greedy, pig little pigs!

278
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:55,900
I had to go through that boss show of vemus burning

279
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,220
like a chicken in a pan.

280
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,500
Then, some time you guys, I run this thing

281
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,640
pointing till the same place.

282
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,140
I said, I'm going to make a wish.

283
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,780
There's a beautiful like a hoodlum or Tirana bird that I hate.

284
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,480
I get up.

285
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,520
was a mistake. George Orwell knew it. George Orwell knew that heaven is run by the pigs,

286
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,840
as above, so below. And now you know it, friends. Now you know it. Even Chuck Jones knew it.

287
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,660
This is how the world ends, not with a bang, but with a stutter. That's all, folks!

288
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,140
There's no keyboard up here, but I hope you'll not mind me singing this one a cappella.

289
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
There we are!

290
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:58,860
Somewhere in subgenius heaven, you'll find slack.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,820
Eternal salvation, sex, drugs, rock and roll, or triple your money back.

292
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:30,880
Somewhere in subgenius heaven, there's fields of frop and bars that keep pouring shots

293
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,160
and won't ever let you stop.

294
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,200
Oh, way above Jehovah,

295
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:50,000
that's where these dirty deeds are done and where I'll be.

296
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:01,840
I've been beating it until it creaks and climbing crack mountain for weeks.

297
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,420
That's where you'll find me.

298
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,980
Because,

299
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:20,600
somewhere in subgenius heaven, dreams come true.

300
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:31,420
I paid my thirty dollars, so, oh, so can you.

301
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:41,460
I may have missed the aliens and hunting down pinkos, but I'm not going to waste my time.

302
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,460


303
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,460


304
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,580
Where do you think you'll go?

305
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,100
Dungeon, lieutenant,

306
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,260
where's the the decent or the bad guy?

307
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,260


308
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,880
And I'm alive,

309
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,660
even in a relationship with even a bad guy,

310
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:57,920
and my key in your pocket is...

311
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:57,920


312
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:57,920


313
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,120
No, you don't have to.

314
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,240
THE HUGE TRIM stopover

315
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,240


316
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,240


317
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,380
I hope you're varias de standing tall with a cannot.

318
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,380


319
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,120
I can easily see

320
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,120


321
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,000
Because I'm there persuading some of you

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,380
where stuff's so annoying that you can't take a cut.

323
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,500
Or not.

324
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
So then why do your lives matter?

325
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,440


326
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,100
It's just like that,

327
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,800
shit flies

328
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,820
along with all of those

329
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,780
other things that

330
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
your mother sang of

331
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,780
in her drunken

332
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,400
lullabies

333
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,320
Hell

334
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,540
fucking yes!

335
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,500
Praise Jadis!

336
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,680
Drugs First

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh great

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
You may need drugs

339
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
So what do I do?

340
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,240
Take your pills? It's making us feel better

341
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
And my ears itch

342
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,260
Yeah yeah yeah

343
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,860
An hour of slack will do that to you

344
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,920
Itchy ears, sour brain

345
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,460
Speaking of which

346
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,860
That was a nice rant and song by

347
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,060
Reverend Janus

348
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,500
The kind of new subgenius we could use more of

349
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,060
Which is by

350
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,720
definition impossible

351
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,580
Oh well

352
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,140
But he wasn't the only one to sing

353
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,720
Over the Rainbow at 13X Day

354
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,620
Drill No Sir

355
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,600
The sex goddess

356
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,460
Reverend Fat Man D

357
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,680
seduced Princess Wee

358
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,500
into joining her in another

359
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,760
illegal flight over the restricted

360
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,240
airspace known as

361
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,160
13X Day

362
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
For our next song we're gonna

363
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,420
click our heels together and

364
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,940
go over the rainbow

365
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,020
Somewhere over the rainbow

366
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,880
Blue's

367
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,080
Oh we're so high!

368
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,020
Blue birds!

369
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,100
Yeah I thought it was skies

370
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,440
Skies are blue isn't it?

371
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:06,780
Oh

372
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
She knows!

373
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:09,700
She knows!

374
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,940
Way up high!

375
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,740
Way up high!

376
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,620
Cause we're high!

377
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,900
Way up high!

378
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,260
That's why we forgot it was self descriptive

379
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,020
Nothing like rehearsing in a Novi's campground

380
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,440
Okay

381
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,840
Somewhere over the rainbow

382
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,800
Way up high

383
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:46,460
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

384
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,520
Somewhere over the rainbow

385
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,100
Skies are blue

386
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,900
And the dreams that you dare to dream

387
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,720
Really do come true

388
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,760
Someday I'll wish upon a star

389
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,780
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

390
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,560
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

391
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,760
Away upon those chimney tops

392
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,680
That's where you'll find me

393
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,900
Somewhere over the rainbow

394
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Blue birds fly

395
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,080
Birds fly over the rainbow

396
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,300
Why oh why can't I?

397
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,960
If happy little blue birds fly

398
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,340
Beyond the rainbow

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,160
Why oh why can't I?

400
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
Marijuana

401
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Butter

402
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,640
They all came together in opposition to

403
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,060
Uh

404
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,040
Uh

405
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,180
Uh

406
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,260
Uh

407
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,140
Uh

408
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,180
Uh

409
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,580
Uh

410
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,120
Uh

411
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,180
Uh

412
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,200
Uh

413
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


414
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


415
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


416
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


417
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


418
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


419
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


420
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


421
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


422
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


423
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


424
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


425
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


426
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200


427
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,060
Marijuana

428
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,540
Butter

429
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,840
Zombies

430
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,360
Relax

431
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,180
This music

432
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,880
Depends

433
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,600
How much

434
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,620
Is too much

435
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,860
Tch, twit, twit, twit.

436
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,580
Rest in bed whenever you can.

437
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:57,920
Dead.

438
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,440
Use pain-killing medication.

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,580
La, la.

440
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,060
Your doctor.

441
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,860
Pleasuring.

442
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,620
Keyholes.

443
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,360
Because it feels pain and discomfort.

444
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,120
Waiting.

445
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,780
Feeble-mindedness.

446
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,300
Death.

447
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,200
Blindness.

448
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,760
White.

449
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,720
Madness.

450
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,480
Burning.

451
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,640
Physical decrepitude.

452
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,680
Burning.

453
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,860
Sexual perversion.

454
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,660
Burning.

455
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,280
City.

456
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,900
Neurotic.

457
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,780
Egg control.

458
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,660
Burning.

459
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,400
Heavy bleeding.

460
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,020
And bones.

461
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Sexual benefits.

462
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,700
Nothing.

463
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,060
Heavy bleeding or discharge.

464
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,160
Burning.

465
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Deviant.

466
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,240
Dog.

467
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,520
Perforated alpha.

468
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,160
Fish man.

469
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,960
And vomiting.

470
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,420
And gold.

471
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,740
From one of the ovaries.

472
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,580
Empty bottles.

473
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,720
And vaginal bleeding.

474
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,820
Cardboard boxes.

475
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,000
Cigarette ends.

476
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,720
Masturbation.

477
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:33,980
Nothing.

478
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,600
And sinful vaginal penis.

479
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,560
Brain practice.

480
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,700
And on her daughter.

481
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,380
4-1-3-0-1-3 days.

482
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,980
And I'm glad it's over.

483
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,120
Burning.

484
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to represent the assembly of the flaming carpet.

485
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,480
I am the very esteemed universal philosopher of absolute reality, Reverend Frodus.

486
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,800
I am the founder of the 28th Day Adbaptist Movement and Grand Master of the Order of the Crimson Finger.

487
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,360
Professor of audiophilic mixology at the apocalypsolic branch of the Dobbsian Mental Lodge for sanctimonious conditioning.

488
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,480
And student of the teaching of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

489
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,900
You may call me Reverend Suds.

490
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,760
And I am the mofo of Mojo.

491
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,580
Pastor Fister Gag Hole.

492
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,180
Master of Fat Fuck Foo.

493
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,560
And Soki of the Order of the Crimson Finger.

494
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,780
Friends, we come before you this day changed over, man.

495
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,820
With soaring hearts and stupid grins.

496
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,060
With the scars from a lifelong battle against the oppressive machine of the conspiracy.

497
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,480
Fuck the conspiracy.

498
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,660
We stand before you first-hand accounts of slackful gains, shocking nuggets of wisdom,

499
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,580
trippy recounts of landscaping sessions, and raging contempt for the pathetic masses of pink pestilence.

500
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,820
And none of it would have been possible without the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

501
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,040
Praise motherfucking Bob.

502
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:52,880
Praise Bob.

503
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,600
Praise Bob.

504
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,840
Praise Bob.

505
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,600
Praise Bob.

506
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


507
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


508
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


509
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


510
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


511
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


512
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


513
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


514
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


515
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


516
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


517
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


518
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,600


519
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm a beacon for Bob's mighty luck to shine no matter how much the conspiracy tries to drag us down.

520
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,100
No matter how much the conspiracy tries to tie us down.

521
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,320
No matter how much the conspiracy tries to tear us down.

522
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,560
No matter how much the conspiracy tries to beat us down.

523
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,900
Bob, will show us the way.

524
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,360
Let us pray.

525
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,880
Our salesmen who art in Dobbs Town, name thy behalf.

526
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,080
Come, he who died, come and come again.

527
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
Give us each day our daily flock and justify our trespasses.

528
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,120
To those who cannot take a joke.

529
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:43,940
We are the people who are seriously suffering from a major problem.

530
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,100
Oh, it feels good.

531
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,760
Hallelujah, peace, peace, Lord!

532
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,140
I know the word hell.

533
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,540
Yeah, yeah, girl.

534
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:54,600


535
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:54,600


536
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:54,620


537
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,880
It was like the end of the world.

538
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,300
There was destruction everywhere.

539
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,660
People scrambled around in hysterical panic.

540
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,000
Cars and buses and taxis were slamming into each other by the second.

541
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,400
Mass confusion reigned like never before.

542
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,400
And the cause of all this?

543
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,280
Bob?

544
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,780
Let me hear you some genius!

545
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,680
You're not Jesus.

546
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
You're Bob.

547
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,080
Yes, Bob.

548
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,600
You're Bob.

549
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


550
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


551
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


552
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


553
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


554
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


555
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


556
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


557
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


558
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


559
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


560
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


561
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


562
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


563
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


564
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


565
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,600


566
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,620
Take a good look with your eyes and say a goodbye.

567
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
The sauce is on our side.

568
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,640
Damn right.

569
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,460
We got the pipe.

570
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,180
We got the tools and we wrote all the rules.

571
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
They want to cancel those plans.

572
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,940
Let me tell you now where you stand.

573
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,380
Starfish, kiss the night.

574
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,560
It's such a glorious sight.

575
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,920
Chomp your face in the dirt.

576
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
Show you what you really were.

577
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,120
Step back to the end of the line, cause it's our time.

578
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,280
This ain't no game, son.

579
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,300
You fix it better.

580
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,040
Run, run, run.

581
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm on my hot horse and I'm gonna ride, ride, ride.

582
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,880
I hit the power source.

583
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
Make us fly, fly, fly.

584
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
I paid my dues to the man with the pipe.

585
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,540
And we hold all the guns.

586
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,640
We're gonna watch this planet blow tonight.

587
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
Cry, baby, cry.

588
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,540
Tears won't change the story.

589
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Scream, baby, scream, cause it won't change a thing.

590
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,580
Just to fight your sin with a pipe and a grin.

591
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,860
There ain't no asking why.

592
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,420
It's time to slack off or die.

593
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs, master of slack.

594
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,000
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

595
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,140
I'm on my hot horse and I'm gonna ride, ride, ride.

596
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


597
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


598
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


599
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


600
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


601
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


602
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


603
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


604
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


605
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


606
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


607
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


608
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,140


609
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,720
I hit the power source.

610
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,780
You fix it better.

611
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:27,860
Run, run, run.

612
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:27,860


613
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,940
Put it under Bob's control.

614
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,360
The hover expires while you wait.

615
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,300
Operators are standing by.

616
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,560
From then on, there's no stopping the pop as it spreads from town to town.

617
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,160
I'm a yeti through and through.

618
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,460
Ain't nothing that you can do.

619
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,680
Make all the pings start shaking in their boots.

620
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,800
Make the conspiracy one of you.

621
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,380
You can't hold me or control me.

622
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,140
All the bobbies, whatever you mean.

623
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,120
Till the sausage come down and burn your tongue.

624
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


625
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


626
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


627
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


628
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


629
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


630
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,120


631
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,600
There's no stopping the pop as it spreads from town to town.

632
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
There's no passing dough.

633
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,140
Collect 200 million souls.

634
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,880
Sunrise July 5th and the martial symphony shall be recorded.

635
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,540
Then it's time to settle the score.

636
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,840
It ain't about the battle.

637
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,980
It's about the war.

638
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,220
The revelation that comes after the score.

639
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,860
I got more.

640
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,280
First you stand in the Bible.

641
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,580
Play the black and the silent.

642
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,220
It's just too damn much for all of us to rely on.

643
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,480
Cry, baby, cry.

644
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,020
Tears, woe, jades, and story.

645
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,140
See, baby, scream.

646
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,340
Cause it won't take a thing.

647
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,060
Justify your sin with a pipe and a grin.

648
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,380
There ain't no asking why.

649
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,980
It's time to slap your heart or die.

650
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,140
Say you're a black bear with a pipe.

651
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,060
J.R.

652
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,180
Bob Dobbs, master of slap.

653
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,080
It's my last chance to save your life.

654
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,280
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

655
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,960
Don't leave your cruel and sacred soul.

656
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,460
Put it under Bob's control.

657
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,380
This offer only goes through X day, July 5th, 1998.

658
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,360
You can't stop the pop.

659
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


660
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


661
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


662
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


663
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


664
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


665
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


666
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


667
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


668
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


669
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,360


670
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,800
For Christ's sake, isn't there one you fucking maniacs

671
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,980
that know who I'm talking about?

672
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,280
July 5th is coming.

673
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,700
There's no time to wait!

674
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,120
Serve a World Cup golfer's head on a plate.

675
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,260
Know the bliss from the rings of Bob's pipe smoke.

676
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,320
And if you call within the next 30 minutes,

677
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,440
we'll throw in a par-press prairie squid.

678
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,980
Damn, in some parts of the universe,

679
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,600
this thing would be considered gritty!

680
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,620
Woo!

681
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,100
Repent, quit your job, slack off, and drink bomb!

682
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,780
Monkey Hive recorded live at 13X Day Drill.

683
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,460
Unbelievable.

684
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,340
Praise Reverend Suds Pasha and Reverend Gaffer

685
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,440
for that.

686
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,700
More to come in the future.

687
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,640
Before that, collages by Reverend Heart Ignition.

688
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,620
And next, Reverend Fat Man D.

689
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,780
Still on topic from 13X Day Live.

690
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,260
But first, The Large.

691
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,220
I wanna be high.

692
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,680
I wanna be high.

693
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,140
I wanna be high.

694
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,020
I wanna be high.

695
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,020


696
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
And through it.

697
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,740
And through it.

698
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,740
And through it.

699
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,180
And through it.

700
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,720
So I think I'd like to sing you one brand new one

701
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,180
before I bring up my very special guest,

702
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,380
this gorgeous girl.

703
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,000
This gorgeous girl.

704
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,880
Let me find it.

705
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,520
I've never sung it in public before.

706
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,880
But I think you will like it.

707
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,140
And if you don't,

708
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,960
you, yeah, fuck you.

709
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,680
If you don't like it, fuck you.

710
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,000
I wish I could say that.

711
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,980
I wish I could say that.

712
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,440
I'd be like,

713
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
like, you don't fucking like my show?

714
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,740
Yeah, I don't fucking wanna sing for you.

715
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,640
I don't fucking wanna sing for you.

716
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,360
That's not how that works, though.

717
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:20,980
That's not how that works, though.

718
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,600
I don't fucking wanna sing for you.

719
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:25,600


720
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,860
You never wanted whiskey.

721
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,740
You never wanted rye.

722
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,140
You only asked me for the reefer.

723
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,000
But for the reefer you must die.

724
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,460
My friend the priestess told me

725
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,720
She warned me of your church.

726
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:50,960
And I said,

727
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


728
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


729
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


730
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


731
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:50,960


732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm gonna go to church.

733
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,080
Who gave the starving child

734
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,540
Who gave the starving child

735
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,680
To the nuns who

736
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,820
To the nuns who

737
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,420
She dreamed of nuns

738
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,820
She dreamed of nuns so blinded

739
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,140
By their faith

740
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,960
By their faith they could not see

741
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,340
They could not see

742
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,340
A hungry baby

743
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,500
A hungry baby crying

744
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,100
Nearly dying to be

745
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,060
Nearly dying to be free

746
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,940
Nearly dying to be free

747
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,660
You never wanted whiskey.

748
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,860
You never wanted rye.

749
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,380
You never wanted rye.

750
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,380


751
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,980
You only asked me for the reefer.

752
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,760
You only asked me for the reefer.

753
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,680
But for the reefer you must die.

754
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,420
But for the reefer you must die.

755
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,140
What do angels sound like

756
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,300
What do angels sound like

757
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,040
When they're crying?

758
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,220
What makes them raise

759
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,080
Their voice in song?

760
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,220
Is it music

761
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,580
Or a death march?

762
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,080
Are we dreaming

763
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,780
We've been wrong?

764
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,220
I hear the church bells ringing

765
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,500
I hear the church bells ringing

766
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,240
They tore down trees to house

767
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,400
They tore down trees to house their dead

768
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,160
The living goddess

769
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,700
The living goddess sings among us

770
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,340
I can still

771
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,960
I can still hear her in my head

772
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:13,900
I can still hear her in my head

773
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,800
I wish those priests

774
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,480
I wish those priests surrender

775
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,760
Walk away with their

776
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:34,860
tales of sin. I live for life and for loving. I care not for the lies they bring. You never wanted

777
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:50,180
whiskey. You never wanted rye. I only asked you for some reefer. But for that reefer I must die.

778
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,780
I must die.

779
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:44,840
Won't you help us feed that child still hoping to survive? Why can't we feed it loving? Must it choke for your false gods to survive?

780
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Where is your Jesus hiding?

781
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,940
Where is your Jesus hiding?

782
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:50,940


783
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:50,940


784
00:34:50,940 --> 00:35:12,400
When I can hear my goddess sing. This earth's forever growing. It knows not of Christ your dead king. You drink the blood of your savior. His flesh grinds between your teeth.

785
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,920
But I'm from civilized people. I praise the life beneath my feet.

786
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:20,920


787
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:20,920


788
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,860
But I'm from civilized people. I praise the life beneath my feet.

789
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:40,220
We will feed the baby. From our bosom it will feed. Your priests can call me harlot or witch if they so be all a need.

790
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:49,180
I don't want your whiskey. And I don't want your rye.

791
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,920
I don't want your whiskey. And I don't want your rye.

792
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:50,920


793
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,580
I only asked for a reaper

794
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,680
I think those priests must die

795
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,600
Thank you so much.

796
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,420
As you can tell,

797
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,520
I don't get to sing that one at the club too often.

798
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,820
Fatman D of FatmanD.com did that.

799
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,260
Next, a subgenius song about 10 years ago

800
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,680
and just now reintroduced to us

801
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,480
by Dr. Jerry Faison.

802
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,700
A song called Pink Boys.

803
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,900
Pink Boys.

804
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,940
Pink Boys.

805
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,040
Pink Boys.

806
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,280
Pink Boys.

807
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,380
Pink Boys.

808
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,180
Pink Boys.

809
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,240
Pink Boys.

810
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,260
Pink Boys.

811
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,020
My body is a temple and I'm a hope

812
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,720
And one man's sacraments, another man's gold

813
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,840
The minute God appears in a river

814
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,900
The way you live away your power to the social engineers

815
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,340
They say you're profiting, it doesn't make a way to feel

816
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,260
To figure it out, there's all that bullshit to live

817
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,700
The best profession is a good education

818
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,340
Not being a criminal, so not by invasion

819
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,500
Absolutely not by domination

820
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,340
I predict in the near future

821
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,220
the right wing

822
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,880
will use

823
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,620
drug experience

824
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,280
as a pretext

825
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,420
to set up an

826
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,400
international

827
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,620
police operation.

828
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,660
I hear you, man.

829
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,880
Those guns behind your butt.

830
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,420
Hey.

831
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,540
It was up in the big boy.

832
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:47,600
Hey.

833
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,520
Your flesh is my appeal, boy.

834
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,520
Please stay patient.

835
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,680
Hey.

836
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,860
Tell me what's up with the big boy.

837
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,540
Hey.

838
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,640
My body is a temple and I'm a homeboy.

839
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
And one man's sacrifice,

840
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
another man's gold.

841
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,820
Sacred plants and vegetables

842
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,620
have been used for thousands of years

843
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,620
to expand

844
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,460
man's mind.

845
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,180
Man's

846
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,720
mind. That one

847
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,280
was not from

848
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,600
any time recently.

849
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,120
Pink Boys was the name of the song

850
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,660
by Jerry Faison from

851
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,900
the 1990s.

852
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,920
But now, from last July

853
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,220
2010, live at

854
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,180
X-Day 13,

855
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,380
Tommy Amoeba.

856
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,320
For my next

857
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,260
number, I would like

858
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,440
to sing to you

859
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,380
a song that I wrote.

860
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,760
It was inspired by

861
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,320
a short story

862
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,780
by my favorite

863
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,260
scientist.

864
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Science fiction author

865
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,440
Arthur C. Dobbs.

866
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,820
It's called

867
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,700
The Nine Billion Names of Bob.

868
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,320
I folded

869
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
up my

870
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,380
telescope

871
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,700
and waited for

872
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,160
the wind

873
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,500
to blow

874
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,940
the clouds away

875
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,120
so I could

876
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,100
see the stars.

877
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,820
But when

878
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,360
the heavens

879
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,400
were unveiled,

880
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,720
how could I

881
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
trust my eyes?

882
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,340
Beyond

883
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,540
belief,

884
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,020
I

885
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,920
stood beneath

886
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,100
a

887
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,240
black and empty

888
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,180
sky.

889
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,980
If you listen

890
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,040
for the sound,

891
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
of the voices

892
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,660
in your head,

893
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,920
the nine billion

894
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,660
names of Bob,

895
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,980
will be whispered

896
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,300
in the wind.

897
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,440
As I'd given

898
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
up all hope,

899
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,300
all my wonder turned

900
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,540
to dread,

901
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,780
I folded up

902
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,020
my telescope

903
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,340
and waited

904
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,260
for the wind

905
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,260


906
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,940
for the wind.

907
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
We're going to have a couple of ranters before the next act.

908
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,620
And the first ranter is an interesting character.

909
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,620
His name is Reverend Jim Jones.

910
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,080
I'd like everybody to give a hand for Reverend Jim Jones, who apparently has something he

911
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,240
really loves.

912
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,240


913
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,240


914
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,240


915
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,560
He really,

916
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,900
really

917
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,300
needs to let out.

918
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,420
Thank you for giving me a hand, Reverend Stang.

919
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,080
Now I wish I had some good news to tell you people.

920
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,140
I wish I could tell you about how Bob entered my life and how everything was okay, but I can't do that.

921
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,740
So therefore, I'm going to need to make a request.

922
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,680
I need all the haters.

923
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,980
I need you to get up front.

924
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,440
I need all the people that have been crapped on by life.

925
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,100
I need all the people that are ranting and screaming and are mad as hell.

926
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,200
I need all of you up here right now.

927
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,820
That's what I'm talking about.

928
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,260
Now, I'd like to begin things the way I end them.

929
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,400
So I'd like everybody, just for a second,

930
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,460
if we could all join together

931
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,560
for a moment,

932
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,200
of noise!

933
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,060
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

934
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,700
Yeah!

935
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,820
Thank you very much.

936
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,080
Now,

937
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,140
Pisces told you that there was something I need to get off of my chest.

938
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,000
It's actually on my chest.

939
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,880
I have this thing.

940
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,980
It's called a hate gland.

941
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,020
Now, you might think to yourself,

942
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,580
why do you need a hate gland?

943
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,720
Just with...

944
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, that's the thing.

945
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,260
For most people,

946
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,040
when something makes them mad,

947
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,160
they're just out with it.

948
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,600
You know, wow, you made me mad.

949
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,620
I'm gonna hit you in the face.

950
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,000
But in our world,

951
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,360
we can't do that to Pinks no matter how much we want to.

952
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, we want to.

953
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,240
So what do you do?

954
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,640
You get your hate gland.

955
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,300
And every time somebody says something stupid,

956
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,060
your hate gland fills a little more.

957
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:42,900
Yeah.

958
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
When those Pinks,

959
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
when they tell you that you're just gonna get over it,

960
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,980
your hate gland fills a little more.

961
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,480
When they ask you what it is about this Bob thing,

962
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
your hate gland fills just a little more.

963
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Well, tonight,

964
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,020
the next day before the pink...

965
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,180
before the X's show up,

966
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,300
we're gonna get all that hate gland out.

967
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,640
I'm emptying it,

968
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,600
and now I'm taking all you with me.

969
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,220
Yeah!

970
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,220
All of you!

971
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,380
See?

972
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,220
Even he couldn't hang out with it.

973
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:20,940
Yeah.

974
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,860
And he's back.

975
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,320
Don't worry.

976
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,980
He'll be out again.

977
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,560
Now,

978
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,780
I've been thinking a lot about the Pinks.

979
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,680
They're kinda in your face.

980
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:35,920
Ugh!

981
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,100
I just can't get them out of their head.

982
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,920
They're like a virus.

983
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,740
They're like some cheesy 80's band.

984
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,320
And they're just like,

985
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,060
they're growing.

986
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,000
And it's like,

987
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,540
you're gonna get a swelling head from the normal,

988
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:46,740
the pinkness.

989
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,280
Now,

990
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,640
a lot of people think,

991
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,120
you know what,

992
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,820
I can pay my $30 and I'm good.

993
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,000
I will have slack.

994
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,040
The conspiracy will stay off my back.

995
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,340
Everything will be okay.

996
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,800
All I gotta do is pay that $30.

997
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:02,860
No!

998
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,100
No!

999
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:04,640


1000
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,500
You think you can do it every day?

1001
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:07,720
No!

1002
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,140
You gotta praise Bob every day.

1003
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,540
You gotta fuck shit every day.

1004
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,800
You gotta make mistakes.

1005
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,280
Every goddamn day!

1006
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,940
That's what I'm talking about!

1007
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,620
You gotta be a subgenius every minute.

1008
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,040
And if not,

1009
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,340
then you backslide.

1010
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,280
And you might think,

1011
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,720
well, you know,

1012
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,380
if I backslide,

1013
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,300
I still pay my $30.

1014
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,800
But here's the thing.

1015
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,480
You may get on those saucers,

1016
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,720
but you will live a lifetime of slacklessness.

1017
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,140
If that's all you do,

1018
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,380
you gotta get that original slack.

1019
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,700
You gotta get it back in you.

1020
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,380
Thank you.

1021
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,000
Can I get a praise, Bob?

1022
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,120
Yeah, yeah!

1023
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,220
Yeah, yeah!

1024
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,040
Yeah, stamp straight!

1025
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,600
Stamp straight!

1026
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,520
That's what I'm talking about.

1027
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:54,900
Now,

1028
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,020
I want,

1029
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,640
you can get that slack back.

1030
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,980
First, you pay your $30.

1031
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,380
Step one.

1032
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,180
Step two,

1033
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,680
you give money to Bob.

1034
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,500
Yeah!

1035
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,600
How do you give your money to Bob?

1036
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,040
You go to the swag shack.

1037
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,100
You spend money at the swag shack.

1038
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,820
You listen to the hour of slack

1039
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,400
every single week.

1040
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,300
Now, you see,

1041
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,960
Now, you see, here's the thing.

1042
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,160
I'll tell you guys a little bit of a secret,

1043
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,160
a little bit of a confessional.

1044
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:32,940
I,

1045
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,520
I used to be like those normals out there.

1046
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,740
I know, I know!

1047
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,560
I don't believe it either.

1048
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,700
I used to think, you know what,

1049
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,460
maybe if I just, you know,

1050
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,020
work a little harder,

1051
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,900
make a little bit,

1052
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,460
yeah, then I'll get slack.

1053
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,020
Maybe, maybe,

1054
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,340
maybe if I just smoke a little bit more,

1055
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,960
then I'll get slack.

1056
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,380
Maybe, maybe,

1057
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,520
maybe if I just cut my hair

1058
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,260
and shave my beard and look normal,

1059
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,380
maybe I'll get slack!

1060
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,840
And then I had a vision.

1061
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,580
Then I saw, you know what I saw?

1062
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,080
I saw that face!

1063
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,260
I saw that face!

1064
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,660
That face!

1065
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs!

1066
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,660
I saw that face!

1067
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,720
And I looked at that face and I said,

1068
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,640
what the hell is this, this Bob guy?

1069
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,180
Fuck!

1070
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,400
I don't want that Bob guy.

1071
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,300
I want like Jesus.

1072
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,580
I want the goddess.

1073
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,700
I want that Wiccan shit.

1074
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,480
You can get the Wiccan chicks that way.

1075
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,160
But no, no!

1076
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,340
I got Bob!

1077
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:37,360
I got Bob!

1078
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,980
And I'm sitting here and I'm like,

1079
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,900
what do you want from me, Bob?

1080
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,100
Why won't you leave me alone?

1081
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,660
And he said, no!

1082
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,660
I'll make you a deal.

1083
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,300
You, and I was like, okay.

1084
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,560
Yeah, I was like, you know what?

1085
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,380
Okay, okay.

1086
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,920
We'll make this deal.

1087
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,540
You tell me what you're gonna give me.

1088
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,260
And he said, here's the deal.

1089
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,040
First, you pay your $30.

1090
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,320
Then, you listen to the hour slack.

1091
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,600
Then, you buy shit at the swag shack.

1092
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,380
And then, you will get slack.

1093
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,520
Yeah!

1094
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,980
Now, I wish I could say that I fake my hate.

1095
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,820
I wish I could say to you guys that, you know,

1096
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm not really like this.

1097
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,000
You know, like Stang does.

1098
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,360
You know.

1099
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,100
I wish I could be that cool.

1100
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,760
But you know what?

1101
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,120
I'm not.

1102
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,580
Because I look at the pinks and I feel, hey!

1103
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,320
Can I get a praise, Bob?

1104
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,360
Yeah!

1105
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:36,740
Yeah!

1106
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,740
Yeah!

1107
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,280
I look at their excuses, I look at the dumb shit they do, and I'm like, ugh!

1108
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,920
That's what I'm saying.

1109
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,620
That's what I'm saying.

1110
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,980
How am I doing for time?

1111
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,940
We got it.

1112
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:00,840
Now.

1113
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,360
Yeah.

1114
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,720
Whatever you want.

1115
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,160
Yes!

1116
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:11,780
Sex!

1117
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:12,520
Sex!

1118
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,580
Bob is better than sex!

1119
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,020
He is better than drugs!

1120
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,660
He is better than everything because he is slack!

1121
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,800
He is everything and all of that and none of it at the same time!

1122
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,240
That's what I'm talking about!

1123
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,800
Now.

1124
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,020
There's something I want you guys to get ready for that we're going do here in a minute.

1125
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,500
Now.

1126
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,400
Now, I thought I could do this for a long time, but you know, I'm going to cut it short, give you the essence.

1127
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,500
But I want you to start getting ready for it now.

1128
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,840
Now, I know I'm not the only person that has the hate.

1129
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,740
I know all of you fuckers got it too.

1130
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,100
Don't lie.

1131
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,220
Don't front with me.

1132
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,820
You all got it.

1133
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,440
Now, I want you to take that hate.

1134
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,520
You feel it right there.

1135
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,800
That type of hate that makes you sick.

1136
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,120
That type of hate when everybody says something bullshit about Bob.

1137
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,340
Whenever Bob says bullshit to you.

1138
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,080
All of that everyday crap that's in your head right now.

1139
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,220
I want you to start getting ready.

1140
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,560
Because at the end, when I get that tone from Pisces, we're going to do a one minute hate.

1141
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,340
I'm not just going to do it.

1142
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,540
I'm going to make a fool out of myself.

1143
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,560
Don't you worry about that.

1144
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,760
But I'm going to make a fool out of myself so you guys can do it too.

1145
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,840
So whatever you do, don't worry.

1146
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,020
I'm going to be a lot.

1147
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,200
More stupid looking than you.

1148
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,060
And I can take comfort in the fact that no matter how stupid I look.

1149
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,860
I'm going to be stupider than that face.

1150
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,760
Yeah.

1151
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,880
Because we are not stupid enough to be Bob.

1152
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,900
We are not slantful enough to be Bob.

1153
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,400
And you know what?

1154
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,200
That's okay.

1155
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,440
That is awesome.

1156
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,860
Because it always gives us something to aspire to.

1157
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,560
And I remember I was watching that thing live.

1158
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,380
That CD.

1159
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:08,760
You know.

1160
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,120
You're supposed to get it to kind of like fiddle with your head or something.

1161
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,120
And you know, they said that those eyes and that face.

1162
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,180
That face.

1163
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,520
Can I get a praise for that face?

1164
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,960
Yeah.

1165
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,600
And they said that that face is the face of the conspiracy.

1166
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,620
And that it's all.

1167
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,020
I know.

1168
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,460
I know.

1169
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:29,980
I know.

1170
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,360
And they said it's all the joke.

1171
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,780
But you know.

1172
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,080
What a very wise man said to me not long ago.

1173
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,460
And he said it to all you guys too.

1174
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,320
Tell us.

1175
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,060
Tell us.

1176
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,740
Yes.

1177
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,040
Tell us.

1178
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,500
But first, you got to scream for me.

1179
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,380
Praise Bob!

1180
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,520
That's what I'm talking about.

1181
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,300
Thank you.

1182
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:56,860
Now.

1183
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,260
He said that this may be the greatest joke ever.

1184
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,800
If the earth can make it.

1185
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,000
The punchline.

1186
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,100
But I don't care if it's a joke.

1187
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,480
I don't care if it's funny.

1188
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,820
Uh-uh.

1189
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,500
Uh-uh.

1190
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,620
They're giving secrets.

1191
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,560
That's probably some of that church hierarchy stuff.

1192
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,540
I wish I could tell you about that.

1193
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,880
But I don't know nothing about that.

1194
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,980
I'm just up here screaming.

1195
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,240
Dancing for your amusement.

1196
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,180
Now.

1197
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,380
I think it's about time.

1198
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,040
Do you guys feel that hate yet?

1199
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,620
Yeah.

1200
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,660
Are you feeling it?

1201
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,220
Yeah.

1202
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:37,720
Okay.

1203
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,200
Can I get somebody with one of those conspiracy clocks?

1204
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,080
Give me.

1205
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,980
You know what?

1206
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,300
I was going to give it one minute.

1207
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,940
But I think you guys want two.

1208
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,800
Do you guys want a two-minute hate?

1209
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,700
No.

1210
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,160
We want three minutes.

1211
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,460
You want three minutes?

1212
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,120
You want to give Bob three minutes?

1213
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,920
Here's what I want you guys to do for me.

1214
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,540
Hate.

1215
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,980
I want you guys to scream so loud that they will hear it everywhere.

1216
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,380
Hate.

1217
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,660
Scream.

1218
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:14,660
Woo.

1219
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,440
Go.

1220
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,820
Oh.

1221
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,440
Oh.

1222
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,920
Oh.

1223
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,800
Faster.

1224
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,380
Do it.

1225
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,200
Do it to the ground, people.

1226
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,640
Yeah.

1227
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,080
Yeah.

1228
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,860
Yeah.

1229
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,000
Woo.

1230
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,660
Up you up.

1231
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,140
Woo moves it.

1232
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:51,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, but it's going to explode.

1233
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,780
Thank you.

1234
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,580
Have it yourselves.

1235
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,520
I get kay.

1236
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,520


1237
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,520


1238
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,520


1239
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,260
Buy me a drink on those saucers.

1240
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,160
Amazing, crazy Jim Jones.

1241
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,300
You know what is the coolest thing about that guy?

1242
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,440
His hairstyle.

1243
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,400
Praise fucking Bob.

1244
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,420
Oh, you noticed.

1245
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,860
Well, we appreciate the appreciative.

1246
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,100
Yes, friends, Reverend Crazy Jim Jones did that,

1247
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,100
and everybody was impressed.

1248
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,200
Before that, Tommy Amoeba, likewise.

1249
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,540
That 13X Day Drill, sponsored by the same bunch of knuckleheads

1250
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,700
who did this show, the Church of the Subgenius.

1251
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,820
For more information, see subgenius.com.

1252
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,200
In the radio section of that website,

1253
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,380
you'll find all lists of what we play

1254
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:56,980
and the MP3 downloads of all shows we have ever done.

1255
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,560
That's subgenius.com.

1256
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,180
Meanwhile, Lemur paves.

1257
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,780
The way.

1258
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,340
Thank you.

1259
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,760
Oh, and by the way, the background music during the credits

1260
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,420
was from the new album by Mayan Ruins,

1261
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,100
Sacred and Profane.

1262
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,300
You can see mayanruinstribal.com

1263
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,720
for more information about that fine CD.

1264
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,180
Thank you.

1265
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,420
Joe.

1266
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,860
Juvenile Friday.

1267
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,240
Yes, ma'am.

1268
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Could you hold on a minute, please?

1269
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,160
Yeah.

1270
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,100
Speak just enough English to answer the phone.

1271
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:37,480
Yeah.

1272
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,500
Can I help you?

1273
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:43,700
Yes, sir.

1274
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,280
No, sir.

1275
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,660
Yes, sir.

1276
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,300
No, sir.

1277
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:45,520
Yes, sir.

1278
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,180
No, sir.

1279
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,860
Right.

1280
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,280
Like they say in Tibet, you know.

1281
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,880
No, I guess you wouldn't know it.

1282
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,320
Is that right?

1283
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,060
It's been a lot.

1284
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,480
Right.

1285
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,080
I'll bet.

1286
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:55,820
Thank you.

1287
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,100
Yeah.

1288
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,620
A stoner could have done it.

1289
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:57,980
Go ahead.

1290
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,600
A stoner was right back on the floor.

1291
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,840
Is that all the money you got?

1292
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,820
It's not fair.

1293
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,520
Back.

1294
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:02,720
Back.

1295
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,000
Back.

1296
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,620
Has he been using narcotics?

1297
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,200
What's that?

1298
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:05,660
How's that?

1299
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,820
Tomorrow you get a haircut and those beads come off.

1300
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,260
Yeah.

1301
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,520
Hello.

1302
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,700
Goodbye.

1303
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:25,740
Well, compatriots, compadres, campesinos, mis amigos, we're not here because we want

1304
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,740
to stay on Earth.

1305
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:33,500
And we're not even actually satisfied with what may or may not be.

1306
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:44,120
We are here for one reason and one reason only and that is to have sex with aliens.

1307
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,020
And in that vein.

1308
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,820
Our last selection is the theme song to everybody's favorite sci-fi classic hit, Star Trek.

1309
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,700
This song was written by Alexander Courage and Gene Roddenberry.

1310
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,840
Thank you so much for tuning in to X Day 13.

1311
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,060
Live in Brushwood, the last and only.

1312
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,240
I'm Fat Mandy.

1313
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,540
This is Princess Wiardo.

1314
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:14,900
Woo!

1315
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,200
Beyond the rim of the starlight.

1316
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,940
My life.

1317
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,880
Is wandering in star fly.

1318
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,200
I know.

1319
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,640
He'll find in star clustered reaches.

1320
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,540
Love.

1321
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,820
Strange love a star woman teaches.

1322
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,100
I know.

1323
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,760
His journey ends never.

1324
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:08,400
His star trek will go on forever.

1325
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,920
But tell him when he reaches his story.

1326
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,460
See.

1327
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:19,580
Remember.

1328
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,480
Remember me.

1329
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,640
See.

1330
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,740
Remember.

1331
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:30,740


1332
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:30,740


1333
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:30,740


1334
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:31,520
See.

1335
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,680
See.

1336
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:32,680


1337
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:32,680


1338
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:32,680


1339
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:32,680


1340
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:32,680


1341
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:32,920
See.

1342
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,120


1343
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,100
See.

1344
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,400
See.

1345
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,200
Oh.

1346
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,020
Stay near me.

1347
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,740
Far or near.

1348
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,640


1349
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,940
To play far is fun and sweet.

1350
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,940
We are the Dole!

1351
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:51,980
Oh.

1352
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,600
Love.

1353
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,120
Love.

1354
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:56,580
Love.

1355
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:56,580


1356
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:56,580


1357
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,340
police statistics in français.

1358
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:00,840
Me outside the screen.

1359
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:00,840


1360
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,880
Yes, sir, what'll it...

1361
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,520
Well, hello.

1362
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,500
Can I be of some assistance, maybe?

1363
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,720
I just want my suitcase.

1364
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,080
Thanks, baby.

1365
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,760
Here.

1366
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,520
Small token of my appre...

1367
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:16,940
Oh.

1368
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,780
Okay, pal, whatever you say.

1369
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
You want me to wait?

1370
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:20,900
Yeah, you better.

1371
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:21,860
Yeah.

1372
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:32,680
I headed for the slippery half-open single-beaded plush-white yellow-stretched-out wild-sparkling pudgy cocky-polished little cherubic smile.

1373
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,280
Smiling lassie.

1374
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,700
Flyway fire red blood-stained leather boots.

1375
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,120
Happy of the seven dwarfs in Jungle Getup.

1376
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,580
It was a good time for me and my 38 to announce ourselves.

1377
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,260
Thank you.

1378
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,460
I always do.
