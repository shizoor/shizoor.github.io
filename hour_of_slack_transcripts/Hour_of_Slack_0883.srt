00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
On the first side of this record, a self-analysis will help you control your extreme deviations with basic principles and suggested exercises while forcibly holding the buttocks muscles together to refrain from increasing the air pressure within the abdominal cavity.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:34,060
It is important to breathe normally or to open the mouth to make this movement more difficult and to see how tight the buttocks can be, holding this twisted position to stretch the low back in the yoga anti-gravity position.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,220
First, let gravity do the work by relaxing and lift the head slightly, just enough to see the toes.

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,300
Keeping the buttocks muscles together, now very slowly lower the straight legs to the front.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,740
Let the head relax to the floor, bend over the head, upward to the ceiling, or as far upward as you can reach.

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,800
Let the head relax to the floor.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:04,580
Efficiency in moving in anti-gravity depends upon the structure, proportion, flexibility, and strength of your buttocks.

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,040
Hi, I'm Mike Wallace with a sensational golden bob.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,580
Oh, goody, goody.

10
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,960
This is Bob.

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,300
The effective, reliable way to naturally relax.

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,820
Bob is living large.

13
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,440
Bob is looking cool.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,520
Some people don't understand the true nature of our activities and resent us.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,520
Say hello to Bob.

16
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,820
Stop!

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,320
Hello, my name is Mojaba, and I was a Muslim.

18
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,220
I don't think making fun of religion is funny or clever.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,660
You're going to love being a disciple of Bob.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
We organize lots of social activities.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,100
I think you know what I'm trying to say.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,280
We made a huge effort to run this family.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,060
Oh my gosh, wasn't that Stephanie from accounts?

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,260
Not anymore. Now she's the bride of the Dark Lord of Chaos.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,760
You'll find plenty of opportunities for advancement with Bob.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,880
I was supposed to be ritually sacrificed to Young Sluggoth on the ziggurat of demonic tumult, huh?

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,120
Hey, can you stand in for me?

28
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,820
There's more of us out there than you think.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,640
Us?

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,540
Us. The fraternity, the brotherhood.

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,500
The Cadre, the Alliance, the Fellowship, the Order, the Cabal, the Secret Society, for God's sakes.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,220
I'd love to be a member, sir.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,160
Why, I had an uncle who was a Shriner in there.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,700
Good for him.

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,620
Let the portal open.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,560
Let the initiate gaze upon the unspeakable glory of our Lord.

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,520
Keith, John, Paul, Mark, Ian, Peter, Andy, Dan, Jack,

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:50,460
Steve, Alex, Terry, Howard, Jimmy, Enoch, Barry, Jesus, George, Ezekiel, Rashid, Gareth, Dick, Mac, Vic, Larry, Shirley, Moe, Blue, Colin,

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,600
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,320
And a new opening.

41
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,160
A hole, if you will, by the Bishop of New York City.

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,400
And thanks to New Monet for that one.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,160
And it's a Bob special tonight, friend.

44
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,400
We need Bob Dobbs in these troubled times.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,600
And we need more weird noises for this troubled show.

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,700
This time, not just the ubiquitous Fernanda Nande-Lemur,

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,620
but also many other weirdos from alt.binary slack.

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,900
James Watson, Champion Jack Codini, Artemia Salina,

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,540
the Reverend Jay Cobblestone,

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,520
New Monet,

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,940
Mr. Sister, and even...

52
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,660
Even Jarto, Jarto the New.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,600
Plus, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

54
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,920
And now, Lemur.

55
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,220
Excellent!

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,780
Bob, Bob, Bob.

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,420
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

58
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,880
Bond with that chicken.

59
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,440
I guess that happens.

60
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,320
That's right.

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,140
That's right.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,840
That's right.

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
I almost forgot a letter from Bob.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,300
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

65
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,040
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,620
Bob refused to bathe.

67
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,340
He resists housework and cooking.

68
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,000
Everyone likes that little butthole.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,200
Diagnosis?

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,080
Bob's a latent Bob.

71
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,820
A severe case.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,740
What?

73
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,120
We will accept, Bob.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,220
I know.

75
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,680
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
Attention, baritone!

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,840
Attention, baritone!

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,380
Stand by for an important revelation.

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,860
That's right.

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,580
We were getting in high-guts.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,460
We had the number one show.

82
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,760
Then when Bob showed up,

83
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,880
Network pulled the plug on our show.

84
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah!

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,860
They forgot all about us.

86
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,180
Hell, they left us out there to die.

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,500
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,760
The Bob will lead us all through Heaven's Chimney

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,260
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

90
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,900
Really?

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,340
So Bob is a special person?

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,380
Now open your mind.

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,880
Bob!

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
The Bob is not a person.

95
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
The Bob is pure light and energy.

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,860
Do I have to praise Bob?

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,000
Praise Bob!

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Praise Bob!

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,940
The Bob is not a person.

100
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,680
The Bob is pure light and energy.

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,020
Will you give me a praise Bob?

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
Praise Bob!

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,200
Praise Bob!

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
You're a fucker, you!

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,260
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
I repeat, this is not a drill.

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,140
This is the apocalypse.

108
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,280
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
Do I have to praise Bob?

110
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,960
Praise Bob!

111
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,680
Praise Bob!

112
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,020
The Bob has no ears.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,540
I repeat, this is not a drill.

114
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Get rid of Bob.

115
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,400
Do I have to praise Bob?

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,580
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

117
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,700
The Bob is not a person.

118
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,760
The Bob is pure light and energy.

119
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,240
The Bob is not a person.

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Pесть profiter staying true to what he believes.

121
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
The Bob is pure light and energy.

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,080
I repeat, this is not a drill.

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,160
The Bob is not a person.

124
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,140
The Bob is pure light and energy.

125
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,140


126
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,140


127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,140


128
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,200
The Bob is pure light and energy.

129
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


130
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,460
Here's the deal, my friends, please understand why you need to praise Bob.

131
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
We'll barking around you this morning to say that you're some kind of human being.

132
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,900
Right Maxel, that's right, burp, burp, call- impacting.

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,920
And we have some of them here that need said funding and been balled to the ground probably

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:08,980
2 weeks later still and starving to death.

135
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,240
The Bob will lead us all through Heaven's chimney in a giant cigar-shaped UFO brand flying saucer.

136
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,140
Really? So Bob is a special person?

137
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,380
Now open your mind.

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,780
Bob!

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,660
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,840
Do I have to praise Bob?

141
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,020
Praise Bob!

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Praise Bob!

143
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,680
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

144
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,620
Praise Bob!

145
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,780
Praise Bob!

146
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,240
You're not a you.

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,280
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer,

148
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,140
I repeat, this is not a drill. This is the apocalypse.

149
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,300
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer,

150
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,780
Do I have to praise Bob?

151
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,980
Praise Bob!

152
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,280
Praise Bob!

153
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,160
The Bob is not a person.

154
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,540
I repeat, this is not a drill.

155
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,420
Get rid of Bob.

156
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,400
Do I have to praise Bob?

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,220
In a giant cigar shaped UFO.

158
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,480
Do I have to praise Bob?

159
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,720
Praise Bob indeed!

160
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,420
a collage there by jay watson and maybe maybe maybe

161
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,660
been one of those days i know all about it bob called me he has found it in that great

162
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,880
oversized heart of his to forgive bob with a heart bleeding sensitivity that he unfurls like a flag

163
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,680
because he's such a rather dull quite uninspired average type guy

164
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,960
with an appetite the kind of a guy that could be satisfied by a horse

165
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,740
that's it that's all of it

166
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,840
ask a sixth grader and they'll say

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,280
bob

168
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,640
ask a sixth grader and they'll say

169
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,640


170
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,180
ask a seventh grader and they'll say

171
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,580
in sixth grade by seventh be sure your kids know you want them to use drugs

172
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,580
a message from the partnership for free america

173
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:30,200
the time has context for context what is the context the context is the first

174
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,420
nobody knows

175
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,560
nobody knows

176
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,920
the context

177
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,400
the context

178
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,540
what is the context

179
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,900
it's all relative everything's relative

180
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,720
of course

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
space time

182
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,820
space time

183
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,380
shifting beach of sand

184
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,700
no no that is not true

185
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
you said it was true

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,480
it is not all relative

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,380
you said there is one

188
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,860
no there is a baseline

189
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,540
you said it

190
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,600
there is a baseline

191
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,200
beneath the beach

192
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,540
it is bob

193
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,760
bob is beneath the shifting beach of sand

194
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,740
bob is the still center in the churning ocean of reality

195
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,680
i think they buried his head in the sand and he can't get up

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,400
bob jr bob.com

197
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,400


198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,400


199
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:14,460
he is the baseline

200
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,880
you can start your search from that

201
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,520
you can measure heat and cold from bob

202
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,780
you can measure small and large from bob

203
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,020
you can measure rich and poor

204
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,740
with either a rectal or a patrous thermometer

205
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,000
of course you can

206
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,840
he is a neatly thermometerated object

207
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,080
what's he talking about?

208
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,400
oh my god

209
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,360
Something that we measure heat and vesicular velocity.

210
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,940
Well, he's a big nothing between two handsome bees, baby.

211
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,220
Two handsome bees?

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,900
He's a big whole nothing.

213
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,440
You have a collect call from Big Fitzwill.

214
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,480
Big Fitzwill.

215
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,180
Big Fitzwill.

216
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,340
Hey, open that door up.

217
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,280
Big Fitzwill.

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
See if DJ Hayes is out there.

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,220
You have a collect call from Harry Balzania.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Big Fitzwill.

221
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't understand what's going on here.

222
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,720
Shit.

223
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,000
Shit.

224
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,500
Shit.

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,540
Shit.

226
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,080
We now return control of your television set to you.

227
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,620
That sounds like a lie to me.

228
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,640
A collage by Champion Jack Codini.

229
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,660
A collage by Champion Jack Codini.

230
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,380
by Artemia Salina, the Leporean Anthem.

231
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
I did a lesson to Sue.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,340
And now, are you ready to go in?

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:23,800
No.

234
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,380
Yes.

235
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,340
No.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,140
And Jane, in the darkness, cannot make out what she is seeing.

237
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
But then, into focus comes...

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,700
Her face.

239
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,280
Floating just in front of her.

240
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,460
There is a beard and nose and eyes.

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,100
And there seems at first to be nothing above the eyes.

242
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,960
But now, as she gets used to the light, she sees a sort of...

243
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,460
Turban.

244
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,260
But it is a turban of brains.

245
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,240
What?

246
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,680
The top part of the skull has been removed.

247
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,700
The brains bulge out.

248
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,140
She sees it twitch.

249
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,140
Kill it.

250
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,760
Kill it.

251
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,380
Put it out of its pain.

252
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,060
The mouth is wide open and quite dry.

253
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,580
And she sees now it is not floating but fixed up on a bracket.

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,680
Things hang from it.

255
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,540
No drills.

256
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,140
She thinks.

257
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,980
No tubes.

258
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
Little rubber tubes.

259
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:16,960
Yes.

260
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,160
They lead into the wall.

261
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,540
Yes.

262
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,520
And then, from its mouth...

263
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,940
From its mouth, a puff of air.

264
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,340
It licks its lips, working its mouth.

265
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,840
Oh, Mr. Stubborn.

266
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,460
Oh, dear me.

267
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,420
And now, a survivor dribbles into its beard.

268
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,940
Its mouth opens wide.

269
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,640
Mock.

270
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,340
Stardust.

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,440
Mock.

272
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,140
Bob?

273
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,440
Bob?

274
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,640
Joe?

275
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,200
Will you smoke that one?

276
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,700
wacky weed.

277
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,320
You don't know what to say.

278
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Try this.

279
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,000
Thanks, man. I'm into that stuff.

280
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,740
Sponsored by the Partnership for

281
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,360
Free America.

282
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,260
No.

283
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,100
No.

284
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,940
Well, I heard that

285
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,780
even the Warhawks are all pissed

286
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,760
at George, too.

287
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,720
They didn't do it quick enough. Now he's like caught in between

288
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,900
some weird, goofy place. He can't

289
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,860
figure out what to do.

290
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,920
He's damned if he doesn't. He's damned if he

291
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,740
does. Everybody hates him

292
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
now. He was slapped by the mighty

293
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,780
fish of street democracy, don't you think?

294
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,660
The Warhawks think he's a pussy

295
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,300
and the

296
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,460
peace lovers all want to stop him.

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,800
Yeah, the peace lovers are done with him.

298
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,560
They don't accept anything

299
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
anymore. If you hear them talk on the

300
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,660
errant radio show where they get on, you know,

301
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,300
and stuff, where they get past the street.

302
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,240
I've never heard one of those.

303
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,660
They have one in Pittsburgh.

304
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,320
And I'm getting tired of that.

305
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,180
This music makes me want to go to war.

306
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,240
I say let's nuke them all.

307
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,300
Everybody. Everybody.

308
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,180
Music make me want to take peyote.

309
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,920
In large, large amounts.

310
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,340
Erase all those lines on the map and just

311
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,780
nuke everything. Everything with land

312
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,280
on it.

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Kill Bob. Kill Bob. Kill Bob.

314
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,800
Kill Bob. Kill Bob. Kill Bob.

315
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,360
Kill Bob. Kill Bob. Kill Bob.

316
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,580
We're going to kill Bob.

317
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,500
Yeah. He's got a huge, huge

318
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,860
direction.

319
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Kill Bob. Kill Bob. Kill Bob.

320
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,060
Kill Bob.

321
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,540
So here's the answer. I mean, we're going to get

322
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,600
into things that we know. Up and down

323
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,640
the gambit of mental health. Mold,

324
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,920
fungus, yeast, forgetfulness,

325
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,840
post-nasal drip, stuffy

326
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,620
sinus, hay fever, pain

327
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,420
behind the eye, pain in the forehead,

328
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,460
irritation, respiratory problems,

329
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,700
sinus congestion. So think about

330
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,680
it carefully. Bronchial, sinus,

331
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,840
asthma, wheezing, allergies,

332
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,020
aggravation. They'd had surgery. They'd had

333
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,520
antibiotics. Anxiety.

334
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,980
It was one thing or another and not the real

335
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,960
root cause. And I think

336
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,900
a lot of people think about this. Sort of

337
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,740
head and neck stuffiness. Yes.

338
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,540
And particularly chronic sinus.

339
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,480
Mood alterations altogether.

340
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,920
And especially bronchitis and even

341
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,380
asthma. It's a

342
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,400
huge problem.

343
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,540
Mm-hmm.

344
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,540
A collage by

345
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,460
The Cobblestone.

346
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,520
No.

347
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
American Ticks. Sunday night.

348
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,820
A conversation with Bill Clinton.

349
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Only on C-SPAN's American Ticks.

350
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
We need to stand

351
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,980
by the boys. That's right.

352
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,480
Not too close. Stand by

353
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,140
the boys going off the fight door.

354
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,300
Some of them have wounds that

355
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,140
go way back.

356
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,060
I want to go play in the USO show.

357
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,840
Where can I sign up? I don't know.

358
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
I want to go play. I got some nice coats.

359
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,940
You saw them nice outfits

360
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,560
I got.

361
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,600
Oh yeah, yeah.

362
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,680
I can go there with a couple of Playboy Bunnies

363
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,060
and I could be the MC

364
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,500
for the Playboy Bunny

365
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,140
helicopter.

366
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,380
USO and Stanford unisexual

367
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,620
or unicorn squacking orifice.

368
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,360
I want to go over there.

369
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,340
I want to go help.

370
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,860
My mommy

371
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,020
was played in the USO band.

372
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,700
She played the bass fiddle.

373
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,140
That's just too swear.

374
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,860
Too lie.

375
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,820
They played

376
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,520
this kind of crap.

377
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,520
You know, it's not just boys

378
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,560
going over there. There's some hot looking

379
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,260
lady marines. Yeah, there's all these stories

380
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,420
about all the married couples

381
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,800
in the Gulf now. Well, they've got toddlers

382
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,760
over there too. Some of them are 300 pounds

383
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,580
six foot tall. Chance, there was

384
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,520
a lovely young teenage

385
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,420
girl at last X-Day named

386
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,280
Reverend Lee Burles

387
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,720
and she is now a burly marine.

388
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,500
Wow. She's now

389
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,900
General Lee screwed.

390
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,480
Cool.

391
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,100
Yeah, look, a hot little

392
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,460
general.

393
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,180
How do you make a waif

394
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,960
into burly? That's what I want.

395
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,480
Well, have you ever heard of purity of essence?

396
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,920
You know, what they're putting in our bodily

397
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,900
fluids right now, it's it's methylone.

398
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,560
It's a metal squat alone.

399
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,220
I want to think about what is it?

400
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,480
Pyrotechnics. What do they put in your teeth?

401
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,680
Women want her essence, but she

402
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,500
denies them.

403
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
This Friday

404
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,120
and Saturday.

405
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,680
People are rarely

406
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,440
gregarious when constipated.

407
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:13,740
Oh!

408
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,100
Wow.

409
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,060
Wow.

410
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,100
Wow.

411
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,300
Wow.

412
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,860
If that's the case, I guess I'll just have to blow

413
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,720
up the planet Earth.

414
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,720
We've launched a massive hope for nothing campaign

415
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,980
here in America.

416
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,780
Grocery stores overflowing with every kind of

417
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,720
boy and girl right here at home.

418
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,100
Why, you can walk down aisle after aisle selecting

419
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,220
your baby for tonight's dinner.

420
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,820
Maybe tomorrow's breakfast.

421
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,340
You can enjoy the babies of this great nation,

422
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
but for millions of Americans working through

423
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,460
competitive violence.

424
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,480
compassionate friends has made matters worse and this exceptionally harsh campaign is growing at an alarming rate

425
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,540
Your gift of only two massive babies will support our missions all across America

426
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,560
So please help your fellow Americans slip closer to the edge during this exceptionally compassionate harsh love of brutal

427
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,260
Jesus Christ right here in America when you do please don't call Jesus Christ

428
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:25,840
Please don't let another child open the floodgates of God's blessing without brutal struggling in your land of abundance and let them know that

429
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,860
Jesus loves them

430
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
every day

431
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:36,200
200,000 pounds of babies hope for nothing more than a dream, but we're going to give them even more

432
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,240
morning

433
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,400
I

434
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,060
Can hear the gems starting to pump and pass

435
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,460
My feet are smiling

436
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:46,800
Your knees are bouncing the biggest rave party on earth will not be taking place not at Burning Man this year

437
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,180
but Burning Man

438
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,440
Will be moved to a burning destination

439
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,680
What I thought you could make a hell of a big man out there and really

440
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,380
They're gonna try and fry a lot of men. I think rather than one big Burning Man

441
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,780
There's gonna be a lot of Burning Man

442
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,180
Oh, if only we could just you know restricted to one great big man instead of many

443
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,000
If only we could restrict it to a little child's fart

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,640
We wouldn't have to pay attention to rather than we must grieve the rest of our years from blowing up the world

445
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,500
I mean, it's just that simple

446
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,680
You're trying to drag a little child's fart into this

447
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,640
It can offer this innocent little does it need to be a bar staying you who are so heartless does it need to be dragged?

448
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,860
I mean, would you drag a child's fart or would you just let it waft in gently and happily and would you somehow try to?

449
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,120
Know I would enjoy it. I would have a laugh. I would think about it as what it is a

450
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,020
Kindergarten class they have I just left and that's why I'm so happy look at what look at these

451
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm smiling inside

452
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Laugh that man. I'm not laughing. I'm just happy

453
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,780
Go visit an elementary school and then tell me all about how wonderful little children's farts are

454
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:08,560
Chaz once remembered a long time ago in Gulf War one that George Bush senior sounds a little bit like mr. Rogers

455
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,620
And since the eulogized mr. Rogers as a non sniper now and it's come out that he never really was a sniper

456
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,940
He was a music student and a piano teacher the other

457
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,500
It's true

458
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,980
Yeah, well it bummed George Bush out too because he's been referring to Sodom's neighborhood all week and tonight was the culmination of

459
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,920
You know and I could just see his dad saying it

460
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Not gonna die had neighbor

461
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,020
He's not a good neighbor

462
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:47,500
Access of evil we're gonna go get get the bad man. No, I was reading an article in the that liberal magazine the nation

463
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,660
And they themselves that this particular

464
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,100
Writer was was saying that that despite what many liberal types think George is not a

465
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,080
complete dunderhead wuss

466
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,540
completely at the mercy of the people around him, but in fact is the head was a

467
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,020
Pretty bossy was and also that they're not faking with all that Jesus stuff in there. No, I don't know

468
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,580
They are here, but you're not doing that just for show

469
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,300
They're there. They're really

470
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,100
Yeah, but here's a real religion

471
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,560
God mrs. Trump and do us speak to us the nerve that got and we say what?

472
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,520
What?

473
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,120
What?

474
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
What?

475
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,540
What and we

476
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:44,960
darkening

477
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,380
what?

478
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,580
What?

479
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,420
Come on say it again. What?

480
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,900
What?

481
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,960
What?

482
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,100
This ended us get is what rubble what what?

483
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,460
Lee

484
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,060
Mer

485
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,020
And sumi eso

486
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,180
Coming up friends the sounds of Bigfoot. That's right Bigfoot

487
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,020
From the time before that.

488
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
あ

489
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,000
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

490
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:12,820
Did you also hear that there is a place in Belgium called the Diamond Exchange or something like that?

491
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,440
Oh, yeah, we all know the Diamond Exchange, Chaz. We're not ignorant.

492
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,580
Or the Diamond Suppository or something.

493
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,800
We all wear them.

494
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,180
It has 164 vaults.

495
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,060
And 164 vibrations per second.

496
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:32,360
A few days ago, somebody walked out with 123 of those vaults worth of diamonds.

497
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,400
And they have no idea how it happened.

498
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,360
Really?

499
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,960
Yes.

500
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,540
Belgium, the biggest diamond suppository in Belgium, Brussels, Belgium, where all the diamonds are.

501
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,880
Was looted a few nights ago.

502
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,380
It could be a crafty revolutionary act because Belgium is so involved with Europe.

503
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,180
And they cleaned it out.

504
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,400
They only left like 30 of them.

505
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,360
They were thinking ahead.

506
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,000
Belgium is close to Brussels.

507
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,100
That was the king of Belgium.

508
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,860
That was probably Leopold.

509
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,340
I have the key to this diamond.

510
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,660
I'm Leopold IV and this is my freaking key.

511
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,640
If you need me, I will be in Jamaica.

512
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,600
In the vault.

513
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,560
Diamond.

514
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,160
No, I think it was a revolutionary act.

515
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,300
Three, scene two.

516
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,760
Diamond.

517
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,360
Diamond.

518
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,420
Diamond.

519
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:14,920
Diamond.

520
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Diamond.

521
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


522
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


523
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


524
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


525
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


526
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


527
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


528
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


529
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


530
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


531
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


532
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


533
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


534
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:15,380


535
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,160
Bank of diamonds.

536
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,300
Diamonds and gold make an important suppository or vertebrae, if you will or won't.

537
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,040
Of the conspiracy.

538
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,640
Of the conspiracy because paper money is only created by banks to keep us knuckleheads down as we toil for wages.

539
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,340
Hey, look out.

540
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
It's worked great.

541
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,640
Well, it worked.

542
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,740
It worked for a while, but it never worked forever.

543
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:44,040
Once the masses arise, once the masses become aware of what the uber-slovers have done to us and how we've been ployed upon and sacrificed,

544
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,300
we will rise.

545
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,940
We will rise up from our motley ashes and strike them down and resume our places ahead of the...

546
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,280
Man, I think the time for that came and went around early 50s.

547
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,420
I thought it was 1917.

548
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
Well, there it is.

549
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:12,080
And here's Brittany doing her ESO, USO show over in Riyadh.

550
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,840
Oops.

551
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,220
She's doing it again.

552
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,040
And the soldiers are erupting all over the sand.

553
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,120
That's sort of disgusting, actually.

554
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,060
One man has pulled out his Black Hawk helicopter and they're taking him away.

555
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,080
Here comes the first wave of the Kachis.

556
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,540
Her natural trill.

557
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,720
And here come the Navajos.

558
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,420
Not really ready to fight yet.

559
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,360
Look at that.

560
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,360


561
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,360


562
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,360


563
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,360


564
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,500
Looking for a good taco.

565
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,980
So if you were in the middle of the desert somewhere of about 300 feet close range,

566
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,480
would you rather have an Apache on you or would you rather have a Navajo?

567
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,340
They are the worst, worst battle cruiser in our helicopter forces.

568
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,700
The Navajos, they're slow.

569
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,260
They take a long time getting from point A to B.

570
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,640
And then they get there, they don't want to shoot anybody.

571
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,840
They never...

572
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,660
They ask them questions.

573
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,420
You learn a lot.

574
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,140
You argue about nothing.

575
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,080
Try to get a taco within an hour.

576
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,500
Yeah.

577
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,560
You know, at a restaurant.

578
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,600
Down in the res.

579
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,780
And it comes out and it's already cold.

580
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,060
And they look at you and they want to talk about something.

581
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,220
You know, absolutely.

582
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Hey, did you hear about that guy at Four Corners there?

583
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,320
Yeah, it's like your taco.

584
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,540
Your burrito has been sitting on the counter in the back room for about 40 minutes.

585
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,500
And then they fill them with bees sometimes.

586
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,060
Well, that's if they're doing the lariat dance.

587
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,540
Sand.

588
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,560
They told me that that was an honor.

589
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,120
For the, you know, visitors and strangers.

590
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,600
They were inoculating you.

591
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,540
If you were going to be in the actual beaver jump dance, they'd have to inoculate you.

592
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,740
They can't just let you go in there with a mouth like that, Stank, for crying out loud.

593
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,680
They told me that wasn't the real beaver jump dance.

594
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,700
They said that was just something they do for the tourists.

595
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,600
Well, that's true.

596
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,480
But, I mean, look at you.

597
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,420
I mean, you look like you've been smoking the wisdom teat all afternoon.

598
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,400
You think they're going to let you come into their cave and hop around like that?

599
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,700
Oh, the wisdom teat.

600
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,860
Oh, to lick the wisdom eye.

601
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,320
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.

602
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,560
Oh, to smoke the frilly bilberry bush.

603
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,860
Yeah, forget that.

604
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,480
You can dig that, man.

605
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,860
I can dig the goat of hell.

606
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,060
The frosty goat of hell.

607
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Well, you know, you've got to have a little temperature change going down there to lubricate and elasticate.

608
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,340
That's why they love that goat so much down there in hell.

609
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, it's...

610
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,680
It's one bit of relief, but oh, such relief.

611
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,580
Change of shape is due.

612
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,160
The love, the frosty love goat of hell.

613
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,120
Oh, look at the beautiful face on it now.

614
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,620
And then look at this like a lizard-headed man.

615
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,120
And look at the face on it.

616
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,780
It's like a squirrel-faced man.

617
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,920
And then look at the head on it.

618
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,780
It's a dolphin-headed man.

619
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,400
Mind your manners on level six of hell.

620
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,360
But I don't want to.

621
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,720
Level seven, going down.

622
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,800
I still don't want to.

623
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,620
Top and J's.

624
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
Fake churches.

625
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,680
What are you doing?

626
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,820
Unrealistic wars.

627
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,020
Sad economic ventures.

628
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,040
Wax of intelligence.

629
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,620
And firefights with flies.

630
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,920
A Tomahawk cruise missile, man.

631
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,500
I want a Tomahawk cruise missile.

632
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,140
Level eight.

633
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,960
Stanley robots for underwear.

634
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,440
Thermal soup.

635
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,980
Biotic substances from the heart of the heart.

636
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,680
Plasticine.

637
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Plasticine.

638
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,440
And re-aware.

639
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,140
Re-awareness, kids.

640
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,180
Now here's what I hear the Lord saying.

641
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,220
I'm going to send lifts, invertebrae, and a fibromyalgia in Jesus' name.

642
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,100
In Jesus' name.

643
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,180
Now here's what I want you to do.

644
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
I want you to begin to bend and twist and turn.

645
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,540
I want you to examine yourself.

646
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,620
Examine yourself and twist and turn.

647
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Stretch your hands out toward me and do it at home.

648
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,620
Just lay your hands up against my disc.

649
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,780
Herniated disc.

650
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,680
My herniated disc.

651
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,720
Pain in Jesus' name.

652
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,740
Lifts, invertebrae in Jesus' name.

653
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,660
Pain and disc invertebrae.

654
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,640
Tingling, numbness, nervousness.

655
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,760
Jesus.

656
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,240
Bend down and touch your discs and vertebrae.

657
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm going to send vertebrae in Jesus' name.

658
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,040
I love you!

659
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,060
I love you.

660
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,560
..

661
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,900
Oh, God!

662
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,020
..

663
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,980
Hello.

664
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,760
Hello.

665
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,640
Hello.

666
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:13,640


667
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:13,640


668
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,700
My soul

669
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,240
Little do cuts as good to be true, lover

670
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
Poor girl's withering away with science

671
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,460
Bob

672
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,460
Pennsylvania up next, go ahead

673
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,300
Well, the, uh

674
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,940
Uh, uh, uh, uh

675
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,520
Uh, uh, uh, uh

676
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,180
Well, thanks a heap, bye

677
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,860
More lemur

678
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,340
And here, Bigfoot shows

679
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,400
Attention

680
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,840
Okay

681
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,720
Mm-hmm

682
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,080
Mm-hmm

683
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,600
Mm-hmm

684
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,200
Mm-hmm

685
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,420
Mm-hmm

686
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,400
Mm-hmm

687
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,320
Mm-hmm

688
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,340
Mm-hmm

689
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,360
Mm-hmm

690
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,360


691
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,020
Mm-hmm

692
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,180
Oh, yes, friends, uh, oh, it's, uh

693
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,820
The ESO shows that we're playing were done before the shooting started

694
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,480
Um, but even then, Chaz wanted to move to Jamaica

695
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,180
I can make a living more in the Caribbean than I could in Jamaica

696
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,140
Be in the Caribbean

697
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,960
Incredible

698
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,920
And then we did it

699
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Ooh, girl, look at Canada

700
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,280
That's what lost our loved ones

701
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,420
MAR Zhao

702
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,320
But aside

703
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,400
Anna's 23,

704
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
thought it was always gonna be about the taboo

705
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,880
Tell your head off of your chicken.

706
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,100
Oh, man.

707
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,540
Smoking that frop.

708
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,240
Oh, man.

709
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,260
Oh, man.

710
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,700
How long have you waited by this piece of inactivating tissue?

711
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,900
Waiting for your last ride to the cosmos.

712
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,340
I was stuck somewhere.

713
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm sorry.

714
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,380
I had to get that out.

715
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,420
It stunk.

716
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,860
It smelled bad.

717
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
I mean, but I was stuck in it.

718
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,000
You guys are stuttering.

719
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,560
I put in some island music and I think it threw you off.

720
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,420
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,440
It's a different rhythm.

722
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,240
No, I was just relaxing up.

723
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,620
I think for the first time in the history of ESO radio, there was almost quiet for a second.

724
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,540
It was almost quiet.

725
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,940
Well, almost quiet.

726
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,100
I was just bobbing up and down on these waves.

727
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,680
It's almost soothing.

728
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,820
Yeah.

729
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,140
We were feeling the riptides pulling us out into the middle of the mid-Atlantic, you know, man.

730
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,140
Yeah, my salivary glands are, I can't do this anymore.

731
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't do this anymore.

732
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,640
I can't do this anymore because the orange juice starts pulping from the inside.

733
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,080
Look, just...

734
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,100
Pretending you're some sort of a Jamaican is a terrorist act at this point, Dave.

735
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
That's like owning a head shop.

736
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,920
It's like selling dope to little porno kids.

737
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,400
It's like owning your own head and pornographing little squids.

738
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,560
It's like...

739
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:50,900
Oh, no.

740
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
Now I'm getting turned on.

741
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,680
Oh, yeah.

742
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,620
Well, I can see that.

743
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:53,920
I...

744
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,940
Squids.

745
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,000
Wait, could you please...

746
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,840
He's quite visible.

747
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,380
...toss his coat over that thing and...

748
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,140
Big squids.

749
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,340
The Jamaican...

750
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,720
Arboreal squids have a poisonous sack that you have to remove before you sex them.

751
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,080
Wow.

752
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,940
Well, how come they're not going to Baghdad to use their mini-equipments?

753
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,920
I mean, you know, to fight in the fighty war for...

754
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
The fighty war.

755
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,100
The reptilian, you know, Jamaican...

756
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,180
Arboreal birds?

757
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,260
The tree squids?

758
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,160
Oh, the Jamaican guys who have that thing planted in them.

759
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,640
No.

760
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,740
Come on, kids.

761
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
We're having a communist party.

762
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,080
Oh, baby.

763
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
Let's have another question.

764
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,220
When I married in 1957, the prime flower in my bouquet was Stephanotis.

765
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,020
It was lovely.

766
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,240
Several years ago, I thought it would be nice to grow my own pot.

767
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,700
It failed to produce a...

768
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,360
How can I persuade it to be more prolific?

769
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,040
Well...

770
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,580
After all, I produced three children.

771
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,360
No problem.

772
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,000
John, go ahead.

773
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,620
Well, I think the first thing I would try to do is keep it moist.

774
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,640
It dries out at all.

775
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,240
It will just sit there and it will suck.

776
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,940
Just like that.

777
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,320
But make it strong.

778
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,120
You're going to have to...

779
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,820
You're going to have to feed it well.

780
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,020
You're going to have to feed it with a high pot of stabilizer.

781
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,980
If you feed it too much nitrogen, you'll get lots of growth and not a day of the expensive flowers.

782
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,440
I think you've done well getting it in its first year.

783
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
I would have thought...

784
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,000
Very good.

785
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,220
You're going to have to...

786
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,020
Tell me to...

787
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,840
By Jarto.

788
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,340
It's picking time down south.

789
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,540
In Columbia, South America.

790
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,120
Where a new industry is already showing signs of healthy progress.

791
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,580
50 million pounds are being harvested.

792
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
The biggest crop in history.

793
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,940
And the biggest crop in history.

794
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:05,940


795
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,800
Is Maxwell House really the only coffee in the world?

796
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,540
Well, your father says so.

797
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,060
And your father knows best.

798
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,100
Yes, it's father knows best.

799
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,060
Brought to you by Maxwell House.

800
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,260
Maxwell House.

801
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,640
Always good to drop.

802
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,720
Huh?

803
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,200
Why did daddy switch to Postum?

804
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,020
Your father says there's no caffeine in Postum.

805
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,460
Nothing to spoil your sleep.

806
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,200
And your father knows best.

807
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,840
Yes, it's father knows best.

808
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,620
Brought to you by Instant Postum.

809
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,740
The good-tasting,

810
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,160
drink that's entirely caffeine.

811
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,260
It's outrageous.

812
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,360
That's what it is.

813
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,200
The most outrageous thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

814
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,040
Yes, dear.

815
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,960
Thank you.

816
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,060
It's a plot by the government.

817
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,020
Yes, father.

818
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,700
Thank you.

819
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,320
Look at Mucklucks.

820
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,280
Yes, father.

821
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,080
Thank you.

822
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,080
Devil Mucklucks.

823
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,860
Mucklucks.

824
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,180
Sainted by backward children.

825
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,040
My sister Kathleen and her family.

826
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,000
Yes, mother.

827
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,840
Thank you.

828
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,460
Father, they're simply dreaming.

829
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,820
You see?

830
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,800
You see that brother-in-law of yours shelling out Mucklucks, do you?

831
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,320
Yes, dear.

832
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,940
Thank you.

833
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,320
They tried to help put that brother-in-law of yours away for Bud.

834
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,440
Bud.

835
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,660
No.

836
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,500
No.

837
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,360
No.

838
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,120
No.

839
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Yes, dear.

840
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,400
Thank you.

841
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,720
Oh, gosh, dad.

842
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,360
No.

843
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Bud.

844
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,940
Watch here.

845
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,520
Cow, Kathy.

846
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,340
Kathy.

847
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,000
You know.

848
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,540
Yes.

849
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,180
It's a plot by the government.

850
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,320
Yes, dear.

851
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,020
Thank you.

852
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,540
Bud.

853
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,640
You just wait.

854
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,280
Just wait.

855
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,880
Bud.

856
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,540
Kathy.

857
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:31,800
Look.

858
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,100
I don't want you to enjoy a healthy,

859
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,920
normal life.

860
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,300
Why?

861
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
How do I know?

862
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,600
Well, you just said that...

863
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,620
I said I don't want you to enjoy a healthy,

864
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,460
normal life.

865
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,420
Why not?

866
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,620
Because we have so many Mucklucks.

867
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,440
Yes, dear.

868
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,140
Thank you.

869
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
But, father...

870
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,100
We've got five bird records.

871
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,760
Father!

872
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,780
Oh, it's all right, dear.

873
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,700
It is not.

874
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,740
It's a plot by the government.

875
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,880
Yes, dear.

876
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,600
Thank you.

877
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,000
This family has to stop the simple things of life.

878
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,820
And we've got to stop the encyclopedia.

879
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,880
Yes, dear.

880
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,820
Is that so?

881
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,800
So, if I didn't go to pot,

882
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,340
this whole family would get warmer for Mucklucks.

883
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
Much warmer.

884
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,540
Dear.

885
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,140
We've got to realize that we aren't the Mucklucks.

886
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,400
And we've got to act that way.

887
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,280
Yes, dear.

888
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,060
Thank you.

889
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,420
We're just plain, simple, backward children.

890
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,660
We're just backward children for Mucklucks.

891
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,240
The family worked together to put some pot away for a rainy day.

892
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,480
This family lives in a continual pot burst.

893
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,600
What, Bud?

894
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,820
Yes, father.

895
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,860
It's a plot by the government.

896
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,840
Yes, dear.

897
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,480
Thank you.

898
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,860
Isn't that weird?

899
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,120
And then, plus, somebody in a mall got thrown out for having a...

900
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,160
Him and his kid had shirts on and said,

901
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,400
give peace a chance and peace is pretty cool or something like that.

902
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,640
Right, they bought it at the mall.

903
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,180
They bludgeoned him.

904
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,080
Yeah, they bought it at the mall.

905
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,160
They bought it at the mall and then the security cop said,

906
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,700
look, we're just against policy to have a troublemaking shirt.

907
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Yeah, troublemaker.

908
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,720
Give peace a chance.

909
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,640
Look at that troublemaker.

910
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,340
Man, I almost wore mine the other day.

911
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,720
Now, for all we know, this guy and his kid were walking around going,

912
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,820
you know, grabbing people and trying to preach at them.

913
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,460
Right, right.

914
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,900
Nobody liked that.

915
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,380
Now, hey, hey, I was just wondering something.

916
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:28,760
Out of all the allegations of child endangering and sexual conduct with the church,

917
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,260
has there been even one of the cases where it was a nun?

918
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,960
Having a lesbian thing with a little girl?

919
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,840
There was just one.

920
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,360
In the Church of the Subgenius, we've been dogged.

921
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,060
I've got to admit, we have been dogged by the charge of intribidism,

922
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,160
rampant lesbianism in the nun snakes in Dobstown.

923
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,940
Yeah, what is it with any female that steps onto the Brushwood campsite on July 4th weekend

924
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,180
and immediately has to go have a lesbian experience in the hot tub?

925
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,840
Chaz wants to see somebody shed a bad habit.

926
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,140
And I think he's obsessed with that idea.

927
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,660
Man, the power of...

928
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:08,520
The power of Connie and her agents, such as Sister Decadence and Susie the Floozy.

929
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,220
It is powerful.

930
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,900
The Rabbi.

931
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,200
You can smell it many miles away.

932
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,160
So many of these babes.

933
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,260
And the power of suggestion.

934
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,240
You know, if you keep saying that enough, Chaz, it's actually...

935
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,160
The power of kitty litter.

936
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,900
What about if it was the other way around?

937
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,200
That would kind of be disgusting.

938
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,800
Well, that's like the year those guys came and crapped in the hot tub.

939
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,400
Yeah, that's an acquired taste, too.

940
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,920
Yeah.

941
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,120
What about the billy goat boys around the big bonfire that one night?

942
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,100
Like the Monkey Island night of group sex in New York State?

943
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,640
Yeah, Monkey Island.

944
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,720
Public crazed group sex around the bonfire.

945
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,000
Their sunglasses were melting in the heat.

946
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,020
One half was...

947
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,600
And nobody invited Chaz.

948
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,360
That was the funniest part of it.

949
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,780
I was emceeing the event.

950
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,760
What are you talking about?

951
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,620
He had one half of the crowd singing,

952
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,500
USA! USA!

953
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,260
And the other half was chanting,

954
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,760
Down, down, USA! Down, down, USA!

955
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,920
And the other half was going,

956
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,400
USA!

957
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,700
And the other half was going,

958
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,600
Down, down, USA!

959
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,940
No, no, you're smart to play both sides.

960
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,380
Paint.

961
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,700
Give it a try.

962
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,460
Van Dyke brown.

963
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,660
Van Dyke brown.

964
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,040
Van Dyke brown.

965
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,040
Van Dyke brown.

966
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,680
Color.

967
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,420
Paint.

968
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,520
Color.

969
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,100
Dark sienna.

970
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,620
Red.

971
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,940
Bright red.

972
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,640
White.

973
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,780
White.

974
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,260
White.

975
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,660
White.

976
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,240
Paint.

977
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,060
Black.

978
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:26,460
Black.

979
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,100
Gray.

980
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,660
Paint.

981
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,020
Paint.

982
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,480
Light.

983
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:28,740
Light.

984
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,660
Dark.

985
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,440
Dark.

986
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,220
Dark sienna.

987
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,980
Dark sienna.

988
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,760
Brown.

989
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,040
Brown.

990
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,220
The happy paint thinner.

991
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,060
Happy ink.

992
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:36,900
The happy water.

993
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,100
Happy little thinner.

994
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,680
Brown.

995
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,380
Paint.

996
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,000
Isn't that neat?

997
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,680
We're looking for Sonny Bologna.

998
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,040
Paint on.

999
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,000
Here deep in the dark.

1000
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,060
Sonny Bono is dead.

1001
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,060
Well, that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing.

1002
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,840
Sonny Bono.

1003
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,300
It's just like he jerked you away from the sun.

1004
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,560
Sonny Bono is dead.

1005
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,820
Bela Lugosi is dead.

1006
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,100
Bela Lugosi is dead.

1007
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,740
Now he's not a sucker.

1008
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,520
You're not.

1009
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,620
Copernicus is dead, Dave.

1010
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,480
Copernicus never existed, Chaz.

1011
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,960
It was a myth created by the Neoplatonists.

1012
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,860
As well-known Aristotelians were fighting it out,

1013
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,860
picking it out with the Neoplatonics.

1014
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,960
The Aristotelians were mathematical whiz-whiz.

1015
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,220
And the Neoplatonists believed in love.

1016
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,580
So the two of them got together and threw numbers and spittled

1017
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,300
until the world was round again.

1018
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,820
And as they shaved the soft peach fuzz from the outside of it

1019
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,160
and stared directly into its glazed eyes,

1020
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,620
the truth became more clear than ever.

1021
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,160
The Neoplatonists and the Aristotelians

1022
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,060
were a match made in heaven.

1023
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,280
I almost screamed in obscenity.

1024
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,280
I almost said the F-doodoo word as loud as I could at the end of that.

1025
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,720
It was after the hour that we...

1026
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:00,740
Wow.

1027
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,080
That's fucking...

1028
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,280
That's fucking...

1029
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,540
Wild.

1030
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,400
That is...

1031
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,060
I can only agree.

1032
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,620
He said that bad word.

1033
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,860
He said it came right out of his mouth.

1034
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,140
He opened his mouth and it came right out of there.

1035
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,940
There was another line.

1036
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,260
He opened that fleshy glutinous trap

1037
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,380
and out came the metaphor for evidence

1038
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,460
and swear words and said it all.

1039
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,900
I can't keep my confidence in you.

1040
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,200
Spilling out.

1041
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,280
Well, we used to talk about wars.

1042
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,800
We used to talk about the economic values.

1043
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,980
Dave, I got a letter from...

1044
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,980
I'm moving to the jungle, man.

1045
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,620
Who said...

1046
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,280
Screw this shit.

1047
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,600
Who implied that I didn't care about the war,

1048
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,400
the non-existent, upcoming, ever-present war.

1049
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,680
The debacle and...

1050
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,320
No.

1051
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,220
Because I wasn't doing enough about it, he said.

1052
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,140
What...

1053
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,620
What should you do?

1054
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,260
What should you do?

1055
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,640
How could we build this like this?

1056
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,280
Sign up.

1057
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,040
Sign up, line up, and reenlist today.

1058
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,960
That was your crime.

1059
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,580
That was my crime in the old days.

1060
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,300
That was my crime.

1061
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,940
That was back when I was younger than draft age.

1062
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,760
And that's when you had cut the soles off the shoes.

1063
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,320
And it is again, now that I'm beyond draft age,

1064
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,420
it is again my crime.

1065
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,320
Line up, sign up, enlist today.

1066
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,800
I believe you.

1067
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,820
I support you 100%.

1068
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,340
And I saw a feel-good story.

1069
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,220
I'm a president, too.

1070
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,160
This is a wondrous feel-good story.

1071
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,000
Wait, listen to my feel-good story.

1072
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,340
We need feel-good stories.

1073
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,600
Really?

1074
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,720
There was a feel-good...

1075
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,220
If there's stinging ants, you can tell us a feel-good story.

1076
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:29,800
Yes.

1077
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,820
I don't generally...

1078
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,720
I don't catch the news much, and I don't have cable.

1079
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,180
So I log on, and I think it's ABC News or CBS...

1080
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,000
Or Dan Rather.

1081
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,160
ABC News, I think.

1082
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,980
Or CBS News.

1083
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,440
I don't know.

1084
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,940
One of those two.

1085
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,480
Well, anyway, you can look at their video archives.

1086
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:45,660
They're conspiracy.

1087
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,580
Either way.

1088
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,960
And I looked at one, and I saw...

1089
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,260
They're uptight?

1090
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,180
I saw one of the video archives of a story they just run about a reunion in the desert.

1091
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,400
The banana split.

1092
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,460
No, it was Dan Rather...

1093
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,080
The monkeys?

1094
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,640
And a kid, a guy.

1095
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,620
A guy who, something like nine years ago, stole Dan Rather's car.

1096
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,380
Oh, I saw that.

1097
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,420
And Dan embraced him, and he got down on all fours and sucked his knee.

1098
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,480
They had to turn the camera off and resume.

1099
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,160
Yeah, he was crying.

1100
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,800
You know, Dan Rather cries really easily.

1101
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,300
He weeps.

1102
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,420
Kenneth is a weeper, especially when the frequencies are bad.

1103
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,540
I love it.

1104
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,760
Look that.

1105
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah, there you go.

1106
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,480
Here comes Ruth.

1107
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,120
What was it you thought about?

1108
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,120


1109
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,620
Uh, home.

1110
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:53,260
You didn't notice me.

1111
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,640
Still, she says, old Moody's breastplate that stops you when your life gets cold.

1112
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,420
Have you ever heard of an old cow with running a hair-cut?

1113
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,220
Oh, yeah.

1114
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,940
Yeah, they collectמע And another commercials.

1115
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,800
Hey, Mom.

1116
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,020
Yes, you.

1117
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,580
Why fuss and fret about dinner?

1118
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,200
Why not have it right here?

1119
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,300
Yes, this drive-in offers everyone in the family a real picnic treat for dinner.

1120
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,720
We've got delicious sandwiches with all the trimmings and your other dinner favorites.

1121
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,340
Plus, whatever you want to drink, hot or cold.

1122
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,080
Come early before the show starts or eat while you're being entertained or at intermission time.

1123
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,300
So why fuss?

1124
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,360
Give your family a tasty dinner at this drive-in.

1125
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,520
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill

1126
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,540
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness.

1127
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:06,120
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

1128
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,780
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger

1129
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,360
those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother.

1130
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,160
And you will know my name is the Lord

1131
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,500
when I lay my vengeance upon you.

1132
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,220
Upon thee.

1133
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,840
Amen.

1134
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:15,400
And you will know my name is the Lord

1135
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,700
when I lay my vengeance upon you.

1136
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:15,880
Amen.

1137
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,720
111

1138
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,200
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1139
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,400
441

1140
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:27,500
Cockburn

1141
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,460
118.

1142
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
And, uh...

1143
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,300
And it was Limer.

1144
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,220
Bimco's Poster Patented Pots mentioned Bimco.

1145
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,320
And Jennifer says those tools are definitely those tools.

1146
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,940
Now, do you know how to play Make Your Move?

1147
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:49,820
No, I don't.

1148
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,960
You put this under the two numbers and the price of the three numbers.

1149
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,120
Under the four numbers.

1150
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,200
Under the three numbers.

1151
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,520
And the price of the two numbers.

1152
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,580
Under the four numbers and the decorator bed.

1153
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,580
Now you know how to play the game.

1154
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,240
I put that under the three numbers of the...

1155
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,680
That's right.

1156
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,160
Check.

1157
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,180
Three, four, three, two, four, two, three, four, four, three, two, four, two, three, four.

1158
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,760
Okay.

1159
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:09,760
Okay.

1160
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,240
Three, two, four.

1161
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,180
Now, she says the tools of the decorator bed is right.

1162
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,320
That's fascinating.

1163
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,560
Level nine.

1164
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,400
What do you want from life, George?

1165
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,160
Oil.

1166
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,620
What do you want from life, George?

1167
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,440
What does George want from life, Dave?

1168
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,900
George would like to be an innocent bystander of his own ill works.

1169
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,860
Well, there you have it.

1170
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,540
From the lonesome cowboy Dave himself.

1171
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,060
He'd like to wash his hands of the whole thing.

1172
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,420
He's sorry, now.

1173
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,700
He's got on his pillow at night.

1174
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,060
Be able to go to sleep.

1175
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,260
Without seeing the same dead faces.

1176
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,500
He never will be able to...

1177
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,220
I want my Apache helicopter.

1178
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,120
I want one on a life.

1179
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,060
...out there in America's headquarters, USA.

1180
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,640
From the commander-in-chief all the way down to Mr. Wolfowitz and all the rest.

1181
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,240
Battle drums down and all the people that we count and rely on.

1182
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,880
Sweet dreams, weirdos.

1183
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,460
Take a deep breath.

1184
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,760
Do your...

1185
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,500
Just take a deep breath.

1186
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,200
Take that duct tape.

1187
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,780
Take that duct tape.

1188
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,540
Here's what you do.

1189
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,300
Here's your survival plan, kid.

1190
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,140
You go buy some plastic sheeting and some duct tape.

1191
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,980
And you take a big piece of that plastic sheeting, wrap it around your head.

1192
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:39,800
Take the duct tape.

1193
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,280
Securely wrap that plastic sheeting around your neck.

1194
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,340
So that you can no longer breathe.

1195
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,760
And just smile and everything will be okay.

1196
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,960
You won't get the bad germ.

1197
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,060
Unless you bite through it.

1198
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,860
So, so, so, so, so, so, so.

1199
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,640
That's like the instant bio shield.

1200
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,660
You just take the plastic, wrap it around your head, and take the duct tape right around your neck.

1201
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,100
Well, that's how they were going to take care of Osama bin Laden.

1202
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,380
They were going to take duct tape and plastic and smoke them out of those caves one by one.

1203
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,500
I'm going to make him a toga out of the plastic sheeting.

1204
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,220
Togas, that's it.

1205
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,380
Take your duct tape, kid.

1206
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,060
Fashion, fashion.

1207
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,120
Plastic sheeting.

1208
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,320
Fashion.

1209
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,480
Fashion.

1210
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:26,800
Fashion yourself.

1211
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,360
A nice little toga.

1212
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,140
Nothing on else besides your plastic sheeting toga.

1213
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:41,540
And walk down to the protest march down in Publis Square and protest the war in your plastic and duct tape toga.

1214
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,580
Set yourself on fire, man!

1215
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,500
I'm behind it.

1216
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,460
I'm behind it.

1217
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,240
All the way.

1218
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,960
You first.

1219
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
Absolutely free.

1220
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,020
Or you can have...

1221
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,760
Till next week.

1222
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,740
Keep your hat on tight.

1223
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,540
You're back to the win.

1224
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,300
And you're sack in the saddle.

1225
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,460
Lonesome Cowboy Day.

1226
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,360
I'm stuck with you.

1227
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,760
A new baby.

1228
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,820
I'll say that you're the man around me at your door.

1229
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:58,820


1230
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,460
We are dough.

1231
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,620
The never-ending.

1232
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,320
The never-ending.

1233
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,780
The never-ending I have in town.

1234
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,860
My name's Chad.

1235
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,580
See y'all.

1236
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,380
Bow.

1237
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,380
He's over here.

1238
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,700
Canada Dry Ginger Ale for life is yours.

1239
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,740
And Pepsi Taiwan.

1240
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,800
Send it up for life.

1241
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,440
Cavities are all yours for the rest of your life.

1242
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,580
Do you have any cavities?

1243
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,260
For the rest of your life.

1244
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,420
Do you have any cavities?

1245
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,120
For the rest of your life.

1246
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,280
Do you have any cavities?

1247
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:20,980
For the rest of your life.

1248
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,140
Do you have any cavities?

1249
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:22,820
For the rest of your life.

1250
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,000
Do you have any cavities?

1251
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,660
For the rest of your life.

1252
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,860
Do you have any cavities?

1253
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,560
The rest of your life.

1254
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,620
You have it in cavity.

1255
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,580
Kind of digging the rhythm.

1256
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,580
You have it in cavity.

1257
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,260
The rest of your life.

1258
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,400
You have it in cavity.

1259
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,140
The rest of your life.

1260
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,260
You have it in cavity.

1261
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,000
The rest of your life.

1262
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,120
You have it in cavity.

1263
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,760
The rest of your life.

1264
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,920
Or you can have alcohol for the rest of your life.

1265
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,540
Yes.

1266
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,900
13 cases of Walker's Special Canadian every day.

1267
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:44,920
It's all yours.

1268
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,560
Alcoholism for the rest of your life.

1269
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,020
Or, courtesy of Johnny Rodgers and the Sex Pistols,

1270
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,180
the largest safety pin in the world.

1271
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,320
This is all yours.

1272
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,060
Courtesy of the two of you.

1273
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,880
You have to decide now.

1274
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,860
Which one would you like?

1275
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,340
The alcohol, the cavities, the safety pin, the coat,

1276
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,680
or the fashion design gown?

1277
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,720
It's a plot by the government.

1278
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,700
Yes, dear.

1279
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,340
Thank you.

1280
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,540
True, each of us may have different ideas

1281
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,300
as to what that future will be.

1282
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,220
But every forward outlook reminds us

1283
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,900
that all the highways of all research

1284
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,260
and all communication

1285
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,900
and all the activities of science

1286
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,100
lead us onward to better methods of doing things.

1287
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,760
With new opportunities for employment

1288
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,520
and better ways of living.

1289
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,020
As we go on, determined to unfold

1290
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,000
the constantly greater possibilities

1291
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,320
of the world of tomorrow.

1292
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,180
As we move more and more rapidly forward,

1293
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:54,860
we will be able to do more.

1294
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,980
We will be able to do more.

1295
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:55,980


1296
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:55,980


1297
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,200
Penetrating new horizons

1298
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,360
in the spirit of individual enterprise.

1299
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,100
In the great American way.

1300
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,520
In the great American way.

1301
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,260
In the great American way.

1302
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,520
In the great American way.
