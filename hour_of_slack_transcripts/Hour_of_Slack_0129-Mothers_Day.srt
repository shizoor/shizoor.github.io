1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,600
Have you seen a boy named Vicky?

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,760
Have you seen a boy named Vicky?

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,460
All right, dear friends.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,320
This is KNON 89.3 in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
I repeat, this is KNON.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,000
All radio viewers expecting to hear their favorite preacher on KCBI

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,020
should tune their radios to 90.9 FM immediately

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,160
before further damage results to your intercranial capacitors.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,340
KCBI has traded frequencies with KNON.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,980
This change has been in effect for one week and will continue for perpetuity

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,440
or until the rupture.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,300
Whichever comes.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,300
Repeat, this is not Criswell Christian Radio KCBI.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,780
This is KNON, voice of the people, and in this case, other things.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,920
On our new frequency of 89.3 FM,

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
all devout Christians hearing me now should tune their radio dials

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,040
two stations to the right for your chosen program before it is too late.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,440
You may, however, stay tuned to this channel for your most feared deprogramming

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,300
from the KCBI.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,160
The Church of the Subgenius and or other demonic programming

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,060
such as rock and roll, classic rhythm and blues, black gospel,

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,320
Latin traditional and hip-hop, sinful country western,

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,680
and some bad soul brother music on KNON.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,740
All subgeniuses not hearing me are probably spreading idiotic rumors

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,220
that KNON is off the air.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,660
Please cease doing so.

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,640
And one last thing.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,060
Earth people, stop all atomic testing.

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,480
Earth people, cease all atomic testing.

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:00,940
Thank you.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,780
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Stop right there.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,100
Intensifying our prospects, desires,

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,380
and that's when the wheels of action begin to move.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,280
Sorry for jumping in, doctors.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,940
Go on.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,260
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,060
He has a plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
It's his second in the past four years.

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,700
Even if you never intend to write your name again,

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,600
one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,620
Because it was better than looking stupid.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,740
It's natural that we followed the circle.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,100
Around and around and around.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,200
Helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,260
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,540
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,380
Then we dip them in the sacred water.

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,380
And what exactly does this do for them?

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,660
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,660
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,140
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slark.

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,900
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,880
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

57
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,860
That's your key phrase.

58
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,320
It will trickle the entire message without you being aware of it.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,200
Repent.

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Quit your job.

61
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,320
Slack off.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,860
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality?

63
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,420
And the pressure of a crumbling world?

64
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,780
Then this may be for you.

65
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,980
Eternal Salvation.

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,540
Or triple your money back.

67
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,180
The Church of the Subgenius.

68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,760
Bring you another 33.

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,000
30 minutes of condensed uraglic functions

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,100
over the quality audiovisual techniques

71
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,620
exacerbated and complicated

72
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,800
by the Church of the Subgenius.

Copyright 1985-86.

74
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh, Dr. Svoboda.

75
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,360
She said,

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
cutting her own legs off

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,300
in what was to be the...

78
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,200
the foment of a startling new trend

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,940
among the so-called

80
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,160
punk-de-tele-hensia

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,540
where they became

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,340
not only skinheads

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,400
but took it to the next level

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,920
and became boneheads

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,640
actually shaving off

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,800
their hair scalp,

87
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,680
cranial viscera,

88
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
and the top three

89
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,200
molecular layers

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,000
of their

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
brain.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,620
And not only this, but

93
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,220
there are in downtown Los Angeles

94
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,760
and the festering punk boroughs,

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,120
there's even been reports of neckheads,

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,860
these progressive brainheads

97
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,180
have actually shaved their head

98
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,920
all the way to their neck.

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,420
And even taking it beyond that,

100
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,160
in some clubs, it's been reported

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,300
that subgenius is actually not heard.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,960
bands have led to what are referred to as knee heads where the person's body actually ends a

103
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,520
scant two inches above the knee

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,340
oh yeah dear friends well it's mother's day

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,140
jeez i ought to just play that little bit of again that was from uh potatoes potatoes background

106
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,560
music by potatoes a band from right here in dallas and i must say i've been so glad to see

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,520
more tapes being contributed to the show by great obscure local bands because this church is a

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:19,100
trade-off we're into bartering new bands can mail tapes in in this tape in this cape

109
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,340
what

110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,320
you

111
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:29,400
in this case i got the tape because of mother's day well yes sir friends we're going to preach

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,160
on traditional family values it being mother's day and with complete and total disregard for

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,680
all those accidental listeners who do not or cannot comprehend the church of the subgenius

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,820
we'll also have some new swinging area diets some new jane or hyper cleats new charlie manson and

115
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,760
kpfa but mothers you know

116
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,480
my mother is a mother my wife is a mother my mother-in-law is a mother my sister's a mother

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,720
my sister-in-law is a mother my sister-in-law in-law is a mother and when i have to take care

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
oh yes

120
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,900
well you see it's like this

121
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,520
uh that potatoes music there in the background beautiful beautiful lovely

122
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,180
no longer potatoes now it's jay cotton

123
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,400
but i was i was uh doing the shopping on saturday the grocery shopping instead of mom because it was

124
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,600
mother's day and ran into reverend turlington an old church member who much to my surprise was part

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,320
of that band the potatoes seen here on camera three i'll be playing the band the potatoes on camera three

126
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,760
and i'll be playing some more of their stuff later on tonight he had a little child with him and i

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,340
started bragging about how i had two children but it turned out that he had two also and we were both

128
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:10,200
parents feeling those feelings that are denied ye who dast not have kids because you'd rather keep

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,660
doing your drugs or your career a little longer for whatever reason me uh i feel like becoming a

130
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,320
parent is what forced me to get my career started and i'm not going to be a parent for a long time

131
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,320


132
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:27,420
i mean when you're no longer responsible just for yourself but for a potential human being or even

133
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:35,140
better a potential subgenius who will probably surpass you later on in usefulness your entire

134
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,680
focus on what you want changes completely and in a way you you if you still have your instincts

135
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,880
it can really be a big relief

136
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,220
hey you know i actually love my parents

137
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,580
believe it or not when i was a teenager i hated them of course like any normal american kid

138
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:06,280
should unless they're christian zombies but uh two things soon happened back when i hated my parents

139
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,000
that changed that number one i was suddenly married and out of my own supporting myself

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,940
no matter how miserably forget that part and number two i had kids of my own and i began to

141
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,740
show how jobless i was and my kingdom was for me calvary 실�icfoot Senate

142
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,740


143
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,280
according to the rules are these two things

144
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,240
book to private writers

145
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,980
it's called Catholicism

146
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,540
Catholicism

147
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,760
Catholicism

148
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:38,760


149
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:38,760


150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:38,760


151
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,900
Catholicism

152
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:42,940
Catholicism

153
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,500
That don't matter. Bob still loves you.

154
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,640
So you teenagers take heed.

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:57,760
Now, in some cases, your parents really are stupid, ruined, abusive, and or boring fools.

156
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,720
But, you know, on the other hand, a lot of you teens, you're probably like I was.

157
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:17,360
Uh, you just, you don't know how good you got it yet until it's taken away, one might say.

158
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:30,480
So you more stereotype-minded bobbies might not think a sin church like the Church of the Subgenius would have anything nice to say about the family unit.

159
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,560
But let us turn now to the Book of the Subgenius here.

160
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,920
Or else find another piece of music.

161
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,900
Where is my Book of the Subgenius?

162
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,360
My God, what's wrong with these people?

163
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,200
Oh.

164
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,120
Here in, uh, all right, Book of the Subgenius 15143.

165
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,840
15143.

166
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,280
We could say that sex is more important than Bob Dobbs, were it not.

167
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,620
Bob is sex.

168
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,040
The Church of the Subgenius is, indeed, a sexist church.

169
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,180
We're four of the sexes.

170
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:24,800
The intersection, the union of them in whatever sick combinations the parties involved may consent to.

171
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:35,700
However, Bob, my friends, Bob is violently against the humanist forces that would tear down traditional family unity.

172
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,540
The subgenius mutation, you see, tends to run in families.

173
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,700
And we should therefore reproduce to the greatest possible degree.

174
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,500
For we may need backup in case our numbers are drastically reduced in the end times mutant

175
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,340
versus normal warfare.

176
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Now we turn further to 15148.

177
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,700
Oh, listen to that.

178
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,280
Oh, listen to that.

179
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,640
In the family of the Bob.

180
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,340
We must take traditional family values, quote unquote, to their fullest extreme.

181
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Extended tribe-like clans in which each aunt is mom and each uncle dad.

182
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,160
The system nowadays is too big to ensure the preservation of values.

183
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,680
So communities, not communes, should take it upon themselves.

184
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,700
You can only trust your yeti blood kin.

185
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,280
We will always see strife in the home, though particularly between parents and teens.

186
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:55,580
And when a subgenius father sees his son come home in some unearthly new hip hairdo, we often hear this.

187
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,000
God darn it, son, you're being different just for the sake of being different.

188
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,260
But dad, says the teenager.

189
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,340
Everybody's doing it.

190
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,840
So you aren't being different.

191
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,860
You're being just like them.

192
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,960
Well, the father is right, friends.

193
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,300
The son is being different for no other reason than to be different from dad.

194
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:26,120
But he isn't necessarily wearing that fashionable hairdo to be like his conformist, nonconformist friends.

195
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,260
He's wearing it to get him some.

196
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,240
So often the teen subgenius is just as alienated.

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,400
Alienated from his hipster cruisin' buddies as he is from the father pudwielder from whose loins he sprang.

198
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,620
Thus the argument is really moot and springs from simple ape against ape territorial imperative.

199
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,960
Both should try to remember this.

200
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:00,460
A child should have respect for the inflexible, stale wisdom of his progenitors who originally gave him life whether he wanted it or not.

201
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,240
We need the oldsters.

202
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,430
Some of them can actually remember the old ways.

203
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,470
And we should pay homage to our dead ancestors who can intercede with the gods on our behalf.

204
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,410
You can, by the way, insult the ancestors of pinks because they weren't yetis.

205
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:28,750
And youth, in its own stead, must be put in its rightful place of valuable subservience.

206
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,130
As bringers of smart alecky but effective solutions to problems.

207
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,670
Which the elders cannot even see.

208
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,470
Kids have more intelligence.

209
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,650
Basically...

210
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,030
More intelligence.

211
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,530
And use of their brains.

212
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,350
In direct proportion to their own lack of knowledge.

213
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:00,390
We should therefore balance the boring, rigid, good sense of the old with the snotty and insolent originality of the young.

214
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,110
The decrepit and the sly.

215
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,710
The senile should be brought home from the quote, home, unquote.

216
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,970
And placed in a center of worship.

217
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,150
Perhaps next to the TV.

218
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,750
And the young, in their stead, must have a right to life.

219
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:23,630
The church of the subgenius strictly disapproves of abortion after the age of 15 years.

220
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,050
A 15 year old is a living being.

221
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,170
With an eternal soul and an inherent right to leave and to lead.

222
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,590
Even the most horrible life.

223
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,210
Your new family, friends, is not the church of the subgenius.

224
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,830
It's your old family.

225
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:51,310
Seen in the all-forgiving, yet no crap-taking light of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

226
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,010
Your old family is not what messed you up.

227
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,150
It's the harsh reality that made you, you enough to find Bob Dobbs.

228
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,070
Bob in the first place.

229
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,830
If your parents had given you total satisfaction, you'd now live in total boredom.

230
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,550
You would, in fact, be pink.

231
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,950
So, you know, sure, your parents are a bunch of old fuddy-duddies.

232
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,250
And you will be too, mark my words.

233
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,970
But you are a subgenius.

234
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,810
So something must have happened right.

235
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,930
Therefore...

236
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,910
Kids...

237
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,690
Don't kill your parents yet.

238
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,130
Swinging love corpses in the background.

239
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,570
Before we go on here...

240
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,250
I've got a little poem I'd like to read.

241
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,810
My brother, my son, my son...

242
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,470
Brought this home from school the other day.

243
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,850
If I could be my mother, it says, I'd be so nice to me.

244
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,590
I'd never make me go to bed and never disagree.

245
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,970
I'd make my breakfast ice cream, have parties every day.

246
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,170
I'd never say wash up right now or come in from your play.

247
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,450
If I could be my mother, we'd never think of doing work.

248
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,190
We'd always have just fun and school while there'd be none.

249
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,110
I've just now thought this over and something's plain to see.

250
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,830
If my mom let me do these things,

251
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,170
I'd not be so proud of me.

252
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,950
And my wife...

253
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,270
It's just saying, it's women.

254
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,810
You women are so beautiful. You mothers...

255
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,910
A baby can be born with 12 feet.

256
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,830
Mom said, ain't that clever?

257
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,810
And look at them pretty tracks they leave you.

258
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,430
They leave you in the sand.

259
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,710
5, 2, 9, 9, 4...

260
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,830
I checked them feet out and said, boy, you better pick the two you like.

261
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,970
Because I'm not about to buy shoes for them other 10.

262
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,970
The whole world gone crazy.

263
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,110
I wonder, as I look at this nation today,

264
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,030
how long will greed last?

265
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,890
And you know, somewhere y'all should really think of that word.

266
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,970
Not now, just spend some time and think about it.

267
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,270
Because when the truth come out,

268
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,470
and the odds of the truth ever coming out in Atlanta is kind of strange.

269
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,250
But when the truth come out, you find out what's happening in Atlanta

270
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,170
ain't got nothing to do with race.

271
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,950
It's got something to do with greed.

272
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,150
If you dumb enough and ignorant enough to believe some racist

273
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,090
can come in my name, and say, hey, I'm a racist.

274
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,470
I'm gonna go to my neighborhood for 20 months

275
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,390
and rip it off with everybody looking.

276
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,530
And you crazy.

277
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,550
The biggest news today was some people saw some folks

278
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,930
kidnap a child in Atlanta yesterday.

279
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,310
Now, the most blatant, blatant corrupt mind

280
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,270
that had a urge to kidnap someone to one city in the whole world

281
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,230
you wouldn't go is Atlanta.

282
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,270
Unless that thing is bigger than they tell us it is.

283
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,170
And it is.

284
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,970
And if you're all simple enough to believe that Atlanta

285
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,510
is a Ku Klux Klan thing, then you crazy.

286
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,150
First, the Ku Klux Klan do not have the intelligence

287
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,210
to baffle my neighborhood longer than a day.

288
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,450
Two, the Ku Klux Klan do not have a pattern of coming in my neighborhood

289
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,710
ripping off my children.

290
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,830
Black men and black women have never had a pattern

291
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,590
of coming in my neighborhood ripping off black children.

292
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,770
If we was in Atlanta right now and a child walked past here

293
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,710
unconsciously, we'd all watch that child.

294
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,330
A city where everybody is looking and it can still happen,

295
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,330
it mean they looking for and at the wrong thing.

296
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,070
I want to know, what's your opinion?

297
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,070


298
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,070


299
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,830
I wonder how long will your greed last?

300
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,650
I wonder how long will we in this nation fail

301
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,750
to tune into that God force that's locked inside of you.

302
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,930
And I ain't talking about them isms and them ahsms.

303
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,070
I'm talking about that universal God force that's locked inside of you

304
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,550
whether you know it or not.

305
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,450
Oh yes, friends, that was Dick Gregory.

306
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,970
Dick Gregory there, actually from an old tape,

307
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,010
talking about the Atlanta child murder.

308
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,490
He hadn't even gotten to the punchline yet.

309
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,190
I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut in though.

310
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,730
Much as I hate to do it.

311
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,550
Do you need a job or job skills training?

312
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,230
The Opportunities Industrial Center can help you.

313
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,950
Opportunities Industrial Center.

314
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,350
Oh yes, dear friends.

315
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,850
Thank you, organist Chris Gross.

316
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,110
Oh by the way, if you have questions,

317
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,930
and you certainly should, call 823-7490 for information.

318
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,850
Speak to the Willadoves.

319
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,430
823-7490.

320
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,630
But let's look in the book of the pre-scriptures.

321
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,170
614.

322
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,890
And yea, even the banks shall topple in the end times

323
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,410
when these preachers of Bob Dobbs shall come

324
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,830
and it shall wash away the filth and the unmerited.

325
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,470
And clean seed with the new seed upon which

326
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,450
the mobile homes of the subgeni will float

327
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,750
and be carried on high with their party equipment,

328
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,630
their chainsaws and scalpels.

329
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,510
Yea, lo, those doctors for Bob shall float

330
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,270
or mount enter first and achieve slackdomness.

331
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,630
Now friends, our rival cults,

332
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,470
those dear, dear other denominations,

333
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,310
which I shan't mention, such as Christians,

334
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,150
whose numbers swell every day,

335
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,030
they, like us, see the family falling apart in America today.

336
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,410
The attack on the American family.

337
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,970
And they're right, even as we speak it is happening.

338
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,950
Father against son, sister against mother,

339
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,630
father real like too close up against sister.

340
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,090
Oh yes, it's civilization.

341
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,010
It's civilization is falling apart.

342
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,990
One in every two marriages ends in divorce.

343
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,570
And these rival churches, the Christians would say

344
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,730
that this comes from pornography,

345
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,610
from tittery little sex gags on TV

346
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,910
and pre-maritable permissiveness.

347
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,630
Well, that's a lie, my friend.

348
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,250
It's the devil's lie.

349
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,830
The devil is in that supermarket.

350
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,610
The devil is in that Texaco station.

351
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,230
The devil is in that car pulling up behind you right now.

352
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,250
The devil is in the IRS office.

353
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,770
And the devil, the devil lives everywhere.

354
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,150
And he's telling the devil's lies.

355
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,070
He's tearing the family apart.

356
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,230
And I'll tell you how he does it.

357
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,550
And it's what those beloved other churches love the most.

358
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,050
Oh, it's what they say we're trying to destroy.

359
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,690
And we are.

360
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,870
What's tearing the family apart is nine to five jobs, my friends.

361
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,150
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations

362
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,290
where daddy gets up in the morning and goes to work,

363
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,510
kisses kids goodbye.

364
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,270
It's the first time he sees them during the day,

365
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:21,990
kissing them goodbye.

366
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,370
And a kind of simultaneous goodbye and hellos.

367
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,790
Then after work, he gets home about 7 o'clock,

368
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,450
ticked off, so to speak, after a long drive back from the suburbs,

369
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,730
to use a polite term.

370
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,470
And he goes home and he kisses his kids hello and goodnight.

371
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,570
And they go to bed.

372
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,870
And the other churches dare to say

373
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,130
it's because the kids see a little stupid sexy gags on television

374
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,930
or the new permissiveness where men are allowed to do things with other men.

375
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,290
I say that's a bunch of holy hooey, my friend.

376
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,410
I say why not legalize pornography and ban work?

377
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,570
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

378
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,850
Most of these kids grow up nowadays, they don't have parents at all.

379
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,510
They have scarecrows looking over them

380
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,130
in some daycare center.

381
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,770
And if that mother can bear with them,

382
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,830
can stand to change diapers till they're one and a half,

383
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,210
she'll send them off to that daycare center just as quick as she can.

384
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,990
And, oh sure, they're still led by human teachers.

385
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,390
They didn't robots yet.

386
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,950
But, I mean, the kid ain't got no parents!

387
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,830
Because Mr. and Mrs. Mommy and Daddy think it's so important to have job security.

388
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,630
It's so important to be a real American, a normal American.

389
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,310
A normal American.

390
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,890
A American that doesn't know his kids as well as he knows his boss.

391
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,250
Or his employees might be a better metaphor.

392
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,190
And then we find the family falling apart.

393
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,650
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our friends do,

394
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,570
about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.

395
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,650
What they ain't getting enough of, not even on Mother's Day,

396
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,610
is enough of Mom and Dad.

397
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,470
Just a little bit.

398
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,470
I mean, forget the pornography.

399
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,710
Oh, hypocrisy, friends.

400
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,350
Now, I've nothing against hypocrisy.

401
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,650
Every religion has to have its fair share of hypocrisy.

402
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,290
As Bob said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

403
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,530
But that Christian preacher can get up there on TV and, oh, he's so glad to keep you normal.

404
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,410
Keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wife anymore.

405
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,710
Keep young wifey stuck in the house with the kid 24 hours a day.

406
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,530
Turn her into a raving maniac from boredom and pinkness while old Dad, William,

407
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,610
he's out making his sales calls.

408
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,070
And his martinis.

409
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,230
And that way, Mama, Mama don't get no slack.

410
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,890
And Mama turns into a nut, a dingy, cooped-up housewife.

411
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,570
And you wonder why her kids turn to drugs.

412
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,130
They see her just as out of it as she can be.

413
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,550
And they think, oh, I don't want to be like her.

414
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm going to go get messed up on drugs.

415
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,130
That's, I mean, being like her is worse than being messed up on drugs.

416
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,650
That's God's truth.

417
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,950
That's what they're thinking, friends.

418
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,550
So next time they start saying how just because your subgenius Bible has some pictures of

419
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,750
nakedness and dirty words in it, will you just come back at them and say, sir, sir, ma'am,

420
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,230
do you work so hard that you can't remember your kids' names?

421
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,570
Trying to preserve this mighty land, working so hard keeping porno out of the stores that

422
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,990
your kids hate you.

423
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,470
That's what I say, friends.

424
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,450
Because that's what the word of Bob says.

425
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,930
I tell you, my friend, there's no slack.

426
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:43,810
There's no slack.

427
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,610
There's no slack.

428
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,930
I tell you in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there is no slack.

429
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,270
And if you cannot whoop it, go ye down, my friend.

430
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,090
That's what I said.

431
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,950
Go ye down.

432
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,530
There's nothing that says you can't.

433
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,050
The devil don't have a rule book.

434
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,750
You heard me right.

435
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,090
The devil, the devil does not have a rule book.

436
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,390
He's not humanistic.

437
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,790
He's not pacifistic.

438
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,130
And he owes you money.

439
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,750
That's right.

440
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,430
The devil owes you money, my friend.

441
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,390
And so does Uncle Sam.

442
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,050
You have to recognize the devil just like you have to recognize Uncle Sam.

443
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,790
Now, I go down there to pay taxes.

444
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,650
As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

445
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,770
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are.

446
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,130
It's a test of faith.

447
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,250
That's why Bob put the devil down here, to see if we could tell the difference between

448
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,230
him and Uncle Sam.

449
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:31,690
You got to fear the devil and the government or they'll walk right over you.

450
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,010
The devil owes you money, my friend.

451
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,870
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

452
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,370
We can cash it in.

453
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,850
We got to burn out the banks of the devil.

454
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,470
We got to root him out.

455
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,790
Burn out the hate.

456
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,730
Burn out the radiation.

457
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,730
Burn out the fire.

458
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,250
These words may be harsh, but I don't care what they say.

459
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,110
I'll keep preaching.

460
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,910
I'll keep preaching, my friend.

461
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,510
This so-called civilization, on the day that we finally realize things are all backwards

462
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:02,250
and we have slack without work in the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs, then perhaps we'll find

463
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,730
the true civilization, which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.

464
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,170
Next, I think he's probably right.

465
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,170


466
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,170


467
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,750
It doesn't have to have them.

468
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,570
It can have them.

469
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,650
You can be civilized and not live in a cave, but you're probably going to be more civilized

470
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,270
being one of these characters that sits in a cave scratching his butt than you are running

471
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,890
around on a treadmill of false slack.

472
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,970
Oh yes, and look at the humans lined up for the slaughterhouse.

473
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,410
Oh, yes.

474
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,070
The Harvest.

475
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,890
The Harvest.

476
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,810
Oh, oh.

477
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,390
Oh, morning, dear.

478
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,510
Morning, dear.

479
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,550
Wasn't quality time wonderful last night?

480
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,390
Oh, yes, it was.

481
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,110
Oh, but I've got to rise, get out of bed, crunch numbers, and do lunches.

482
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,290
Where are the keys to my 450SL?

483
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,990
I have no idea, but if I don't get my seats from the mayor this morning,

484
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,930
I'm going to be presently late for this meeting.

485
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,610
Oh, sure. Here comes the senior voice.

486
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,970
He drove like Porsches.

487
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,930
Mercedes town sedans.

488
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,830
All customed, upholstered.

489
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,890
But who matched his new tan?

490
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,130
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

491
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,810
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

492
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,690
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

493
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,490
His discs, they were compact.

494
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,230
Because he heard they were the rage.

495
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,010
His taste ran from Whitney Houston

496
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:56,050
all the way to New Age.

497
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,490
Sing, you animals!

498
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:03,010
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

499
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,550
His tracks, banks, partisans.

500
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,110
Madness will come toss and fall

501
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,110


502
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,130

LA

511
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,050
In the fern bars you would network

512
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,870
To satisfy primal urge

513
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,970
Interfacing with young youngettes

514
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,770
With which he might merge

515
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:20,950
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

516
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,630
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

517
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,530
The key promotions did elude him

518
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,410
Though he plowed on unperturbed

519
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,330
But croaked by coronary

520
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,250
Thank you

521
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,310
Before his IRA matured

522
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,890
Sing!

523
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,010
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

524
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,590
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

525
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:19,450
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

526
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:28,410
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

527
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,950
Oh, listen to how I see a big old hunk of snot coming up on that record there.

528
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,750
Must have landed right in the middle of it.

529
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,890
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts, it hurts, dear friends.

530
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,730
Let's pull that one down and bring up that one.

531
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,710
That was the Swinging Aeriodites.

532
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,050
Jeez, I shouldn't have given my good copy to Robert Wisdom.

533
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,390
And you can get the Swinging Aeriodites.

534
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,610
We were playing them last week.

535
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,250
You can get the Swinging Aeriodites albums.

536
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,230
Got that pencil ready?

537
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,410
Ready, right for information.

538
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,030
Because you ain't going to find it in the stores around here, I don't think.

539
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:41,250
Box 923, Northampton, Massachusetts, 01080.

540
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,830
I'm going to be playing another one by them later if I can get the snot off the record.

541
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,890
Doesn't look promising, actually.

542
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,690
Box 923, Northampton, Massachusetts, 01080.

543
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:57,890
01080.

544
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,410
01080.

545
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,210
01080.

546
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,210


547
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,210


548
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,670
01080.

549
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,150
01080 for the Swinging Aeriodites record or tape.

550
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:08,130
Now, friends, the Bathhouse Cultural Centre and Itinerant Theatre Guild

551
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,710
will present an accidental death of an anarchist.

552
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,690
Well, actually, it would be the real death of an anarchist if it was being presented.

553
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,510
This is a play called The Accidental Death of an Anarchist, May 5th through 21st.

554
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:29,010
This play by Dario Foe is a satirical look at the Italian...

555
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,230
Italian police department under scrutiny.

556
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,630
The play is directed by Stephen Mazurek.

557
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,990
Admission is $8 and the performance dates and times are May 5th through 21st at 8pm.

558
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:47,050
Bathhouse Cultural Centre is located 521 East Lother, Dallas, on the east shore of White Rock Lake.

Oh, yeah.

565
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,190
Oh, thank you.

566
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,150
Thank you.

567
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,910
Thank you.

568
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,130


569
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,230
Thank you.

570
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,610
Thank you.

571
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,410
Thank you.

572
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:40,490
Thank you.

573
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,490


574
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,490


575
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,150
Congregation, my, it's good to see a big crowd.

576
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,970
Oh, I've been wondering where a lot of you have been.

577
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,650
I've been wondering about a lot of things.

578
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,590
I'm glad you're here on this Easter Sunday.

579
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,910
Thank you.

580
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,170
Thank you.

581
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,170


582
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:05,550
I'm going to lay the truth down.

583
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,170
I'm going to strap it on.

584
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,010
Thank you for that, amen.

585
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,690
Yes, I'm not going to spare anything.

586
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,250
I'm not going to smooth anybody's fur.

587
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,430
I heard you sister.

588
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,250
Yes, I will preach on.

589
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,130
Yes.

590
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,430
I'm going to tell it like it is, that's to say.

591
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,810
Oh, I heard a hallelujah.

592
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,150
All right, now you all please come up here.

593
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,170
I'm going to get a little bit of a

594
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,210
little quiet down a little bit.

595
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,430
You're getting a little too noisy.

596
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,870
Hold it, hold it down.

597
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,910
I'm talking.

598
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,830
Okay, listen.

599
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:42,630
I'm tired of so much around here that I have to unload on you today.

600
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,490
Do you think I don't know what the hell is going on?

601
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,930
Do you think for instance that I don't know that Bill Broden is going out

602
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,370
seeing Irene, Irene Hobbs?

603
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,350
Yeah, I'm going to start tapping that.

604
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,570
Sure I know it.

605
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,150
Don't you?

606
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,990
What in the hell is the matter with you?

607
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,690
She told me right back there in my studies.

608
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,050
She told me what she was doing.

609
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,830
I know it.

610
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,730
Yeah.

611
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,730
Uh-huh.

612
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:15,130
And this being Easter Sunday and having such a big crowd out here and a lot of strange

613
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,830
faces, where in the hell have you been?

614
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,330
Hell far.

615
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,590
You come once or twice a year.

616
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,990
That don't cut no ass with me.

617
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:26,570
See?

618
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:33,250
You know, we got a Sunday school teacher and you know who in the hell I'm talking about.

619
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,310
Yeah.

620
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,830
Bill Bronson.

621
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,150
That's who I'm talking about.

622
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,230
There he sits right there, Bill.

623
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,430
I'm talking to you.

624
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,370
See?

625
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,690
Uh, you ain't no more taking proper care of that Sunday school class.

626
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,570
Uh, that, uh, and you are finished.

627
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,630
You're fired.

628
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,350
Get out.

629
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,910
You're out of that Sunday school class.

630
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,210
Now listen.

631
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,270
I mean business.

632
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,410
I'm putting it down, ain't I?

633
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,010
I ain't hearing no way of means but I ain't wanting any.

634
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,290
I'm going to go check on that guy.

635
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,290


636
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,290


637
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,290


638
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,290


639
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:04,730
No.

640
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,350
Hell Far.

641
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,930
Hell Far.

642
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,090
Eat or No to Herman's Hermans.

643
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,310
The gross is two fifty.

644
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:12,790
The gross.

645
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,590
Yes, yes, yes.

646
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,190
I am a guest from the Edo period.

647
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,050
In other words, a postman.

648
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,310
I have traveled three times a month in a 9km speed.

649
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,270
By the way, I am a guest.

650
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,830
So, bye bye!

651
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,210
Is she a walkman or a businessman today?

652
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,630
Today...

653
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,270
Walkman!

654
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,930
I am a walkman.

655
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,830
R.O. Evans.

656
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,450
It's a sunny.

657
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,270
Tiano, Asano-sama goes sight.

658
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,210
I have to be in America.

659
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,950
Okay, bye.

660
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,830
Me in America.

661
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,050
Everything free in America.

662
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,190
For a small fee in America.

663
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,330
Oh, save my life.

664
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,790
Yes, sir, dear friend.

665
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,070
I am happy.

666
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,570
I am happier than the morning sun.

667
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,550
That's the way it'll always be.

668
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,470
Ever since the day you came inside of me.

669
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,550
Oh, my...

670
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,450
Praise Bob.

671
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,210
Praise Bob.

672
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,930
Johnny could only sing one note and the note he sang was this

673
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:06,790
Die!

674
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,050
If you want to!

675
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,390
You misguided martyr!

676
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,730
Not me

677
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,110
Not me!

678
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,470
I won't grow up

679
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,910
I won't grow up

680
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,570
I don't wanna wear a tie

681
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,090
I don't wanna wear a tie

682
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,470
And a serious depression

683
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,010
And a serious depression

684
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,530
In the middle of July

685
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,410
Come come baby

686
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,990
So you come out and you draw and you say

687
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,970
Bam bam

688
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,630
Stop!

689
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,710
And the guy doesn't stop

690
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,810
And you move up to the head and you put one right there and that's usually final

691
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,450
Get that spear away from me

692
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,590
John

693
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,010
No, you don't

694
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:15,670
I'm not

695
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,590
You're no soule

696
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,670
I sad

697
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:20,670


698
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:20,670


699
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:20,670


700
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,270
Yeah, yeah, they know

701
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:26,270


702
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:26,930
You got that

703
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,430
You mean like employing love

704
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,430


705
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,430


706
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,190
You're saying I've missed till half an inch

707
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,250
Good God! Good God!

708
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,170
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

709
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,870
Yes, sir, maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

710
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,270
Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

711
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,550
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

712
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,530
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

713
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:51,930
No.

714
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,030
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

715
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:55,870
Well, thanks.

716
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,070
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

717
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,530
Well, he calls it a...

718
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,850
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

719
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,450
they love each other very much.

720
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,350
And in showing their love,

721
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,910
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

722
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,410
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

723
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,890
Or the sperm, as the doctors call it.

724
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,590
Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

725
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,390
That's right, Bob.

726
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:27,950
No, no, Bob.

727
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,310
Yes, it is, Bob.

728
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,050
Well, what I'm talking about now...

729
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,650
No, Bob, it's sort of like...

730
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,270
...is formed in two little sacks...

731
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,410
It's what's in the church.

732
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,330
The church comes out of the two sacks underneath the cloaca.

733
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,090
I am referring to the Church of the Subgenius!

734
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:54,470
Now, the Church of the Subgenius, as founded by St. Arbogdob,

735
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,850
St. Athanasius...

736
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,350
...was founded in 1953 as the parent religion of the future.

737
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,170
You're not even...

738
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:08,190
Superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses, and sci-fi sinners

739
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,790
in a worldwide rampage of immorals and prophets,

740
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:18,630
yucks, and grins, yucks and grins,

741
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,570
which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity.

742
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,590
All too naturally.

743
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,350
And today is modern day.

744
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,590
And you go to society, and that commodity, friends, is slack!

745
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,090
Now, slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

746
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,110
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive us of.

747
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,470
Slack is our way of grabbing wine bottles, lapels, and screaming at it!

748
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:48,610
Now, back in the 50s, Bob himself noticed a decided lack of slack in our culture.

749
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,070
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

750
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,290
He noticed that the normal...

751
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,790
...for the vast conspiracy against the different,

752
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,630
and insidious conspiracy,

753
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,490
dedicated to squelching our natural growth instinct,

754
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,950
dedicated to wiping out our fun factors,

755
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,830
and dedicated in short,

756
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:15,390
to the total, utter eradication of the original slack with which we were all born.

757
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,470
And to the total eradication of Doctors for Bob,

758
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,530
who you hear in the background, friends.

759
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,010
You can help destroy Doctors for Bob by writing Bob,

760
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:25,430
or by sending a message to the internet,

761
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,350
140-306-Dallas-Texas-75214.

762
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,630
Who the hell is somebody?

763
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,450
How many people I know...

764
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:34,590
...how many people I know...

765
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:35,990
...how many people I know...

766
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,250
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

767
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,690
I know, I do.

768
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,230
What about you?

769
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,390
What about me? Well, yeah, what about me?

770
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:47,550
Well, uh, that's what we think.

771
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,610
What about you?

772
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,070
Well, uh, I don't know, what about you?

773
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,490
Well, what about me?

774
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,330
I don't know, that's what I'm going to ask. What about you?

775
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,630
Well, what about you?

776
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:58,250
Well...

777
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,630
Let's, uh... What about...

778
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,970
What about Bob? About what?

779
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,610
About...Bob's pipe.

780
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:10,090
Bob appears and lights his pipe to those who dwell in endless night,

781
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,490
but does a human form display to those who live in realms of day.

782
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,130
Okay! I hope that answers your question.

783
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:16,710
I hope that answers your question.

784
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,730
Oh, that and a lot of others, too.

785
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,710
Let's go over that again. You say you saw some kind of monster?

786
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,310
Monster? Oh, yeah, it was Bob.

787
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:25,410
Monster? Oh, yeah, it was Bob.

788
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,310
Good! And, uh...

789
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,650
No, the human mind plays strange tricks.

790
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:30,730
Yeah!

791
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,770
I'm sure you thought you saw some kind of monster,

792
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,250
but after all, we've put a man on the Moon.

793
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,270
A man on the Moon.

794
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,010
And what's happened to that man on the Moon?

795
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,350
Hello, you're on the Moon.

796
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,710
What are you guys going to help me? I've been here for months waiting.

797
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,570
Stop mooning over the microphone and state your short question, please.

798
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,850
Stop mooning over the microphone and state your short question, please.

799
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,910
Stop mooning over the microphone and state your short question, please.

800
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,110
And I'm tired of the system running me down

801
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,170
And I'm not gonna take anymore

802
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,150
I'm gonna laugh at him

803
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,310
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna laugh, by the way

804
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,310
Prototypical Jerry Lewisoid

805
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,230
A coprolite of the mid-thuringian group

806
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,890
The eldest oyster winked his eye

807
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,170
But never a word, he said

808
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,550
The eldest oyster looked at him and shook his weary head

809
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,210
Meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster bed

810
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,410
Catherine Robbins

811
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,670
But whither goest thou?

812
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,890
Potatoes, the potatoes, dear friends

813
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:42,330
Come and listen to me

814
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,110
Come and listen to me

815
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,150
Come and listen to me

816
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,670
You must know about a man named

817
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,090
Dad

818
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,470
Poor matinee, a bill that gets his family

819
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,810
Bad

820
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,330
Then one day he was shoot for survival

821
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,550
Up from the ground came a public

822
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,270
Rude

823
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,150
Black gold

824
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,310
Texas D

825
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,970
The first thing you know

826
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,390
Old Jed's a million hair

827
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,310
State books

828
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,090
Jed, move away from there

829
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,070
Ted Keller

830
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,630
California is the place you ought to be

831
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:24,890
Load it up there

832
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:25,170
Track

833
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,190
Move to Beverly

We are swimming pools

Swimming pools

844
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,050
The end

845
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:52,050


846
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:52,050


847
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,590
Oh, yes, dear friends

00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,330
far far away

881
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,170
That's where the ice cream cones are placed.

882
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,550
That's where the eclairs stay.

883
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,450
Well, I guess we better start cleaning up here.

884
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,690
It's almost time to get down to the airport.

885
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,930
Now, I want Arnold to carry all the papers over to the side of the class,

886
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,670
and we're going to dump them in the incinerator,

887
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,630
and when we torch the generator, we'll burn up your extra credit assignments.

888
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,210
It's time for the little show almost to go home.

889
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,510
It seems over so quickly here on the show.

890
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,950
The show was beautiful out here tonight.

891
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,810
So we're at the airport with our tickets in hand, ready to fly back to Dallas.

892
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,910
God, is this flight never going to end.

893
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,510
I'm leaving on the show plane.

894
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,810
I don't know when I'll be back again.

895
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,590
When will I wake up?

896
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,050
Never.

897
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,030
Must wake up.

898
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,170
Never.

899
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:05,870
Must wake up.

900
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:11,150
Not let show control me any longer.

901
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:13,490
Squirt.

902
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,910
In other news, doctors expected tests to show no recurrence

903
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,930
of the operation on Reagan's plane.

904
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,810
Now I understand.

905
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,370
I see it all so clearly.

906
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,710
And now I'm part of the show.

907
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,470
And I want to bring others into the fold.

908
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,770
We need more people on the show, and more and more.

909
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,750
So line up here on Shattuck Avenue.

910
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,810
We'll be accepting applicants all during the week.

911
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:43,370
The studio here is littered with bodies.

912
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,630
There's J. Perriot Erickson laying on the ground, dead, of show.

913
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:49,970
Not J. Perriot.

914
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,330
There, Palmer Maverick.

915
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:51,730
Palmer.

916
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,810
The little drummer boy.

917
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:53,630
Me bees.

918
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,230
Me bees.

919
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:56,830
Lays.

920
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:57,650
More bee bees.

921
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,930
With a gun in his hand.

922
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,230
A smoking gun in his own hand.

923
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:01,910
Always.

924
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,650
And what about him, buddy?

925
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,930
There, buck naked lays.

926
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,890
Horribly slaughtered.

927
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,530
Ritualistically carved up.

928
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,770
And Jane, her hyper cleats, next to him.

929
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,730
Dead in a...

930
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,490
Hey, come on, man.

931
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,630
I want to watch what she's doing here.

932
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,850
So if this show crashes.

933
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:19,870
Evil Pat.

934
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,290
Get out of here.

935
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,410
Oh, that stuff never works.

936
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,130
And how are you going to use your seat as a flotation device in the middle of the Mojave

937
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:25,510
Desert?

938
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:25,850
I don't know.

939
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,310
I don't know.

940
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,250
It's all a hokum.

941
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,830
If you go, you gotta go.

942
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,210
Just drink one of these little bottles of alcohol and enjoy the flight.

943
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,730
And I'll follow it anywhere.

944
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,010
Till the sun begs more hardly.

945
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,870
Mommy, they're having sex on the other side of the aisle.

946
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,630
Stop the plane.

947
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,790
They're having sex.

948
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:45,690
Yes, I know.

949
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,230
Mommy, they're having a sex act on the other side of the plane.

950
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,830
And I'll follow it.

951
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,830
As the show begins to deteriorate.

952
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,890
I don't know what they're doing.

953
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,810
We begin to wish you a furry, hairy goodbye.

954
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:59,230
And I heard them explain as they fled out of sight.

955
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,270
Dr. Howell's ears are thinking bye-bye.

956
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,410
There are lies in the sky.

957
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,870
Say goodnight.

958
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,590
And they're hanging out of Bob's pipe.

959
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,330
In other news.

960
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,730
There's a Bob in my pocket.

961
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,470
And it stays up all night.

962
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,330
Well, thank you.

963
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:13,650
Thank you.

964
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,590
Oh, yes, dear friends.

965
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,810
And you can now go to bed.

966
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


967
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


968
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


969
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


970
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


971
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


972
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


973
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


974
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:18,810


975
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:25,310
Now, right to the subgenius foundation or Bob for free information from once again,

976
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,370
P.O.

977
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:35,470
Box one four oh three oh six in Dallas, Texas, seven five two one four.

978
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,790
You know, we were going to read the report.

979
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,990
We're going to start the report tonight from high weirdness by mail because it's not in

980
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,710
the stores yet.

981
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,250
You can't you know, you can't buy it or anything.

982
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,790
And it's full of weirdness.

983
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:53,790
It's full of these these amazing listings of the weirdest stuff that the Church of the

984
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,690
subgenius has ever discovered.

985
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:00,230
But as usual, I ran out of time.

986
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:07,130
So stay tuned, please, for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party.

987
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,730
I'm sure some of you just can't wait for that one to come on and this one to go off.

988
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,970
And we'll leave you with this and maybe something else.

989
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,770
Look at the screen, John.

990
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,450
Look at the screen.

991
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,770
Look at the screen.

992
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:29,190
That television screen was lighted up, although the switch was off.

993
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:33,870
I pulled the cord out of the wall, but the light stayed on.

994
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,810
Listen, we were scared.

995
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:43,350
And I said to whatever was contacting me, are you of the Christ?

996
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:48,510
And the screen lit up with an oversized ball of pure white light.

997
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,570
It just filled that room.

998
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,110
I was hooked.

999
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,530
We talked to that unplugged television set for an hour.

1000
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:00,410
It constantly flashed balls of light to answer questions.

1001
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,710
They went up and down the screen.

1002
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,490
They crossed from side to side.

1003
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,670
There was clear evidence that we were in contact.

1004
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,150
Well, this story is getting a little out of hand, John.

1005
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:13,750
Were you really in contact?

1006
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,450
Well, I say yes.

1007
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,310
But not with a living God.

1008
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,170
Our contact was with the things of Satan.

1009
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,950
We'd hold a seance and results were prompt.

1010
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,570
The Ouija board was very active and very terrifying.

1011
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:28,910
It always worked.

1012
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,950
We never had any problem with it.

1013
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:31,810
None at all.

1014
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:37,590
If you're thinking about starting to smoke, chances are there'll come a time when you'll be thinking seriously about quitting.

1015
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,070
Why don't you just think about that now?

1016
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,750
A question from the Dallas office of the American Heart Association.

1017
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,430
Oh.

1018
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,810
And friends, here's one last.

1019
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:49,690
I'm gonna leave you.

1020
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,130
We got three minutes left, I guess.

1021
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:57,610
Leave you with this one from our old, whole church member, Charlie Manson.

1022
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,410
He was a dreamer.

1023
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,810
We have a dream, too.

1024
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,610
I kill, too, Bob.

1025
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,010
It's all in the eyes of the dreamer.

1026
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,250
It's all in the eyes of the man.

1027
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,490
All the things that we've done in life.

1028
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,450
And all the things that we've planned.

1029
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,230
Can the world be sad as it seems?

1030
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,890
Where are man's hopes?

1031
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,430
Where are man's dreams?

1032
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,210
Or the eyes of the dreamer?

1033
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,170
In the eyes of the man.

1034
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,970
All the songs have been sung.

1035
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,350
And all the saints have been hung.

1036
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,730
The wars and cries have been wailed.

1037
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,730
And all the people have been jailed.

1038
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,590
The world is yours, my friend.

1039
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,870
It's yours to begin or to end.

1040
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,570
Oh, the eyes of the dreamer.

1041
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:02,390
In the eyes of the man.

1042
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,830
Take nothing from nothing.

1043
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,110
Brother, and it's all just the same.

1044
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:12,370
For the loser is the winner.

1045
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,710
And there ain't no winner.

1046
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,750
And there ain't no blame.

1047
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,170
It's just the end of the game.

1048
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,350
The moment is ever constant in the mind.

1049
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,830
Everywhere I look, the blind leaves the blind.

1050
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,090
Yes, you're my friend.
