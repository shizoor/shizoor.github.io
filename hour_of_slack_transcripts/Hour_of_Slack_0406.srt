1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:11,160
But if you can hang in to the last 50 minutes of this show, you will get slack.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,760
You will get slack.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,320
We don't always make that guarantee, but this time we definitely can.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,520
We didn't even know we had the tape until we'd edited the first 40 minutes of this hour of slack, number 406.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:42,280
But stay tuned, and it'll be a normal, a normal hour of slack until the 45-minute point, and then pure, undiluted audio slack.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,940
Oh, that blowhard, why doesn't he sit down and shut up?

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,140
Oh, is this an open channel?

8
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, just joking, as you know, we maintain high standards of radio standards.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,040
We're not going to let you do whatever you want, and we're not going to let you do whatever you want.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,500
I said hi, hi, I want to see some of those guys.

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,100
But they're so broke, I want to see them.

12
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,740
Why do you hate me?

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
Well, it doesn't matter where you let them go.

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,860
Hmm.

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,260
Hmm.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,380
Oh, yes, it's feeling so good.

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeah, it's feeling much better now, folks.

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,780
It's feeling so right.

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,320
Yeah.

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,180
Plenty of this.

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,760
Sex and drugs and rock and roll.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,280
Yes.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,600
And excess.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,300
And love, and love.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,540
Rock and roll and all forms of music.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,400
Tons of caffeine.

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,100
Oh, believe me.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,180
Tons of caffeine.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,880
You better be having that buddy next to you and holding him tight at 10 o'clock.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,440
Yes, yes.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,520
Don't forget, Reverend Ivan Tseng is going to lead us down the wrong path, the path to evil.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,840
The ones that Adam and Eve did not take.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,000
No, no, the wrong paths entirely.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,820
The wrong paths.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,800
And we want you to go down all the paths possible tonight, because the more paths, the better, you know?

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,420
And what will Alvis think when he sees Bob?

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,560
And he finds he is not the king.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,660
And he finds he is not the king.

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:38,900
No time.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll get a baz privately jammed, put a beautiful chain.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,400
Hey.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,400


43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,520


44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,920
Alvis, see there,哎, yeah, they can come at us, I'll be ready.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:50,920


46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,680
If I don't see you no more this year .

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,400
The Subgenius S. who's what?

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,080


49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,420
departments, it is a privateises office.

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,020
What is that?

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,640
The Subgenius is our Behind the Scenes team.

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,620
I don't know what that is. There's a demon controlling...

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,940
Oh, there he is.

54
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,880
That's some nice music.

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,740
That's so much better. An excess of purity.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,980
I had an excess of caffeine this afternoon, folks.

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,240
You may have noticed I was a bit jumpy earlier on.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,040
That's because I had a bit too much caffeine.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,800
It was really bad, and I don't know what happened.

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,000
My brain cells were exploding like spider crabs.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Oh, that's...

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,740
Well, I think I have to stop right now.

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,860
That's when I quit a Sunday morning to keep people awake.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,860
This is the evening drive, you crazy show.

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,780
You know, you have a drive time. This is drive-you-pussy time.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,680
This is why you tune in.

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,940
This is why you tune in to your local radio station.

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think I'm gonna visit the neighbors.

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,580
Yeah, the neighbors. I like the neighbors. They're great people.

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,900
It doesn't take a genius to understand.

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
It takes a sub-genius.

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,100
The dove flowed in the air.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,840
It was blackened by the soot,

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,220
and it fell to the earth.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,120
The dove was by another dove

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,660
that had been blackened by the soot.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Each one knew that

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,880
the other had been contaminated.

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,180
There was love.

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,580
There was hate.

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,060
It didn't matter.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,500
Maybe I'll have some more coffee after all.

83
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, some more coffee.

84
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,940
Thank you very much.

85
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,960
Like I was saying the other day, you know,

86
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,880
it's really funny because all the people that I'm talking to are so confused,

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,400
and I just can't figure out why.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,480
I mean, God, I just don't know.

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,940
How came it that God had not struck him dead?

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,020
The leper's company of his sins closed about him,

91
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,060
breathing upon him,

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,860
bending over him from all sides.

93
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,960
Well, if everyone was pleased,

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,420
I'd have to do something to irritate somebody

95
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,340
just to make sure I hadn't inadvertently slipped into another dimension

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,700
for a visit with Uncle Rod.

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,400
Well, you won't be nearly as disappointed today

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,980
because all I have is burrs.

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,380
Yeah, I'll be bellyaching bitterly and making fun of people

100
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,620
and taking highly unpopular stands on inflammatory issues

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,960
with no real solutions in sight

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,200
and generally undermining the cherished fabric of the American way of life,

103
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,400
the home, the family, and most team sports.

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't worry, it won't take up any of the precious time

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,340
for which I've already planned several hours of innuendo, rumor,

106
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,900
and thinly veiled character assassination,

107
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,880
not to mention overinflated, ill-substantiated opinions,

108
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,360
so don't worry, be happy.

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,040
You know my word's good because I'm the certifiable love child of Elvis and Bigfoot.

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
And as they say on Monty Python's Flying Circus,

111
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,600
I miss seeing that.

112
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,020
Coming up next, a donkey, two schoolboys, and a vicar

113
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,960
in a rousing round of pederasto, the game for the entire family.

114
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,160
Well, that doesn't cause people to come on with a, you know, I don't know,

115
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,060
somebody, I'm gonna need either a defibrillator or a sawed-off shotgun,

116
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,480
you know, somebody's gonna come after me for saying stuff like that.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,440
Oh well, somebody's been after me all my life,

118
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
so it's not like I'm not used to it by now.

119
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,040
Hey, Max, remember that time you used to pick on me in high school?

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,520
I bet you didn't send your $20 in, did you?

121
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,100
We will know our exes, allies by their wings and halos,

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,880
but the normals will think of them as angels.

123
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,960
Most of them will want to be lifted into heaven,

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,820
fighting to get ahead in line.

125
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,740
We'll have to track down the clever ones, but don't worry,

126
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,160
we'll have plenty of backup.

127
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,460
Besides sophisticated killer machines,

128
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,060
we'll have legions of the dead at our command.

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,280
It'll be a party!

130
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,940
I can't, this is just too sick, man.

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,520
Yeah!

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,500
We told them and told them,

133
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,920
but nobody listens to the old prophet of doom

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
until it's too late!

135
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,760
They just have a big laugh and say,

136
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,160
oh, there'll be a lot more parking spaces after the atomic war.

137
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,020
But when it's all over and they see that all the parking spaces

138
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,680
and CD players and 24-hour pop music cable TV stations

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,840
aren't much good when you're vomiting your own intestines out,

140
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,460
they'll then, they'll say,

141
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,260
they'll come crawling back to apologize.

142
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,040
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not paid nearly enough to be infallible.

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
That requires an executive leadership course I can't afford to take.

144
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,600
But it'll be too late!

145
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,240
For we will have long since lost our grip on the wheel of karma

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,640
and have been flung off to plummet through nirvana forever.

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,760
And all because we had the foresight to follow a few simple instructions,

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,240
just spend a few dollars and a few minutes a day.

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,380
And you'll sit there and think to yourself,

150
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,480
up there on that escape vessel,

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,420
you know, I can't believe there was a time

152
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,740
when I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

153
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,940
You'll be sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich,

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,080
getting a scarf job from that biomorph,

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,320
watching widescreen color TV Elvis movies,

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,800
and you'll go, how?

157
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,620
How could I ever have wondered about that 20 bucks?

158
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,040
How could I ever have doubted for a second?

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,220
And think of old, poor old Bob,

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,300
Boba back on Earth.

161
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,700
The guy who said,

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,820
hell, send him 20 dollars?

163
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
That's just what they want you to do.

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll pump gas for 2.38 an hour for the rest of my life

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,180
before I send a dollar to that damn church.

166
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,680
Oh yeah.

167
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,120
Hard times now for Boba.

168
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,580
He'll be lucky if he can find a porcupine to pork.

169
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,100
And just when you're wondering that,

170
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,340
the TV lights up and there's that shot of Boba down there

171
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,640
eating that rat, hiding from the death machines, going,

172
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,340
oh, I was so stupid, how could I have done it?

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,480
I could have been saved, but no, I didn't send him 20 dollars.

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,300
Oh, got another robo beast.

175
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,620
Here I am in this f-

176
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,040
human, strip bear skulls all over the place.

177
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,380
If only I could die.

178
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
But I can't.

179
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,620
I can't die.

180
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,740
Why, if only Bob was here now, I'd give him my 20 dollars.

181
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,380
Ha, I'd give him 40 dollars.

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
I'd give you everything, Bob, please.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,260
And that just shows how much they trusted J.R. Bob Dobbs.

184
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,980
They didn't trust him.

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,200
Didn't trust him.

186
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,060
20 dollars worth.

187
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,220
A lot of people here don't trust Bob 20 dollars worth.

188
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,020
Fine, okay.

189
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,680
No skin off our teeth.

190
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,820
Pay lip service.

191
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,780
Wear that Bob t-shirt.

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,300
Be hip.

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,600
But when those saucers come, you're either,

194
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,440
as those great proto subgeniuses said,

195
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,760
you're either on the bus or you're off the bus.

196
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,480
And, you know, the dumbest nerd could get onto the bus for 20 bucks,

197
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,400
let's face it.

198
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,060
And, actually, their souls go into the little cylinders that Bob,

199
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
I mean, Bob has to have them.

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,380
He's got something to trade to the aliens.

201
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,320
But they should be proud that their little souls, such as they are,

202
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:04,060
at least made it possible for their betters to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,900
I met Bob on highway 61

204
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,140
I did not know of all the things they had done

205
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,520
Oh, it took me by surprise

206
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,860
And I felt it was to hear what he had to say

207
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,380
He was different than from what I'm used to

208
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,960
His hair's clothes had a shine on his shoes

209
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,340
But that really didn't matter

210
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,600
And we traveled out together westward way

211
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,180
He did not know his time and place of birth

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,620
And I thought, hey, around December or around the first

213
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,060
Yeah, the night was dark and cold

214
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,280
And there was no place left in town for us to stay

215
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,480
The local people told him to move along

216
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,120
The word was written and the tension was strong

217
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,660
Yeah, the truth it had been written

218
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,540
That the West would come together someday

219
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

220
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,700
We came together in the spirit of the West

221
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,920
I don't care what the newspapers suggest

222
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,320
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

223
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,720
And they acted like nobody even noticed

224
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,140
The way they gave all of the glory to Jimmy and to Otis

225
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,000
Jimmy

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Otis

227
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,580
Well, Bob still fully knew he wasn't their type

228
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,960
But with his love he still extended his pipe

229
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,280
Yes, he pointed them the way and said for them to look to him

230
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,560
He had a life

231
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,820
The crowd had just begun together there

232
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,260
They wanted more of what Bob had to share

233
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,500
Yeah, they all came together

234
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,140
They were looking down out of the bleachers

235
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,980
And Bob worked his way up high

236
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,380
On one of the great big speakers like some teacher

237
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,800
Looking down on all creatures

238
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,720
And as the multitude had gathered there

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
They could not laugh at the clothes that he did wear

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,480
Yes, it never was expected

241
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,780
When Bob danced around out naked up on stage

242
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,420
Everybody drew their hands in the air

243
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,540
Everybody looked but nobody stared

244
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,060
Yeah, they did not point a finger

245
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,660
Or offend their newfound leader that they praised

246
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

247
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,040
We came together in the spirit of the West

248
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,500
I don't care what the newspapers suggest

249
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,600
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

250
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,020
And they acted like nobody even noticed

251
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,500
They just gave all of the glory to Jimmy and to Otis

252
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,800
Jimmy and to Otis

253
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,340
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

254
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,460
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,740
Bob was a star at the Monterey Pop Fest

256
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,400
You used to laugh about me

257
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,000
Everybody that was hanging out

258
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,920
And now you don't, you don't talk so much

259
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,300
Look at you, now you don't, baby

260
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,280
You don't seem so proud

261
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,960
You don't even be proud

262
00:14:49,960 --> 00:15:18,900
The 16-year old girl

263
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:18,900


264
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:18,900


265
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:18,900


266
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:28,640
this show. A little bit of your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, that's me, doing Nenslo and Papa

267
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:41,360
Joe Mama rants at Starwood just fairly recently. And then a song by John Dajon, if that really

268
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:50,800
is his name, Bob is a Star, Monterey Pop Festival. And while we were playing that song just now,

269
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:58,200
he called from New Orleans to ask a question. He was asking how to get Hour of Slack on

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,060
the radio in New Orleans. And for anyone interested in getting this show in their area, just write

271
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,940
to the subgenius, P.O. Box here. We'll be giving that number presently. It's

272
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:21,620
real easy and very cheap. But Will was talking to John Dajon while that song was playing,

273
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,740
and he never realized until he hung up that he was hearing the same voice in both ears.

274
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,500
There is no coincidence, except it's all coincidence. Only Bob can make a coincidence.

275
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,100
So, yes, there'll be some wonderful worship.

276
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:51,240
Yes, happening tonight. Dear friends, more coming up from everyone. Sorry.

277
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,740
Oh, this is Brain Rock Radio music in the background. Oh, I think we're ready. We're

278
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,780
almost tuned up.

279
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:25,980
As Menzlo said here, I have seen the new Dallas, a non-matter construct which would

280
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:33,240
be built by the exes for the use of rescued subgenii. It is a flaming white plasma city

281
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,860
of vast towers and broad streets where even the poorest marksman with the cheapest gun

282
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,340
can fire three bullseyes in two seconds. I'm going to show you a piece of music that I've

283
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,340


284
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,340


285
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,220
never heard before.

286
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,640
The towers are of infinite height and interior area, yet are thinner than a sheet of tissue

287
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,540
paper. I have seen the end of earthly pinks sucked into the gravity gate at the center

288
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,360
of Earth's interior sun to experience the infinite moment of death between the knuckles

289
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,320
of Jehovah One. I have seen the Earth turned inside out, the Nazi clone beasts bursting

290
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,600
into flame, the golden cities empty, waiting our victorious victory.

291
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,620
I have seen the night of suffering when all dimensions are open to this world and the

292
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,680
endless horde of Earth's noisy neighbors screaming and dying in an apocalyptic horror

293
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,940
of mutual massacre. I have seen the great inversion when time and space change places,

294
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,240
when space becomes directional and time becomes infinite in all directions. I have seen the

295
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,300
pinks stripped of their con-built armor, twisting and crackling in the inferno of Bob's Pond.

296
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,320
I have seen the night of suffering when all dimensions are open to this world and the endless

297
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,320


298
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,100
night of suffering. I have seen the lightning in the mountains,але the lightning will strike

299
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,940
and cut your eyes with its blade. All this and more I have seen, and the Book of Walter

300
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,840
has been opened to me. The destroyer goddess has passed her talents through my very soul

301
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,400
and left me unscathed. Rex has spoken to me of the birth of the Yeti race and the birth

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:07,580
of the virgin mother Yeti woman. I can reveal no more than this, until the time is, quote,

303
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,160
right.

304
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,260
That was Prophecy by Ninslough, friends.

305
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,520
Praise Ninslow!

306
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Beware, I say to you lukewarm subgeniites, you dobshead sporting rubber stamp, dollar-mailing church members, you sickly subgenius artifact collectors, you Bob fans!

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:20:02,520
In keeping with our holy name, the cute and funny joke church by mail department of new realization tears the smirking head of alleged J.R. Bob Dobbs off the front of the head of the church of the subgenius and presents the bloody goggle-eyed skull of a new realization so simple that you could never have thought of it.

308
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:22,820
I, even I, the almighty Ninslow, bring to you the new realization you should have thought of the first time you set eyes on the vacuous, pipe-clenching grin of phony cartoon face Bob Dobbs.

309
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:31,760
Beware, be warned, and behold the great northwest church of the subgenius!

310
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes!

311
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:32,840
With...

312
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,140
No Bob!

313
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,560
Hey, what is this?

314
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:48,320
For too long has the fabulous subgenius church been held spellbound by the fatuous serpentine gaze of stupid cartoon head Bob.

315
00:20:48,780 --> 00:21:01,420
Only Ninslow, the chosen one, could bring to you this new realization of the great northwest church of the subgenius with no Bob.

316
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,760
And, simply, this cose J.R. Bob!

317
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,460
That is poor, poor, obnoxious, nor mature greenery.

318
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:17,460
This side of the Scripture, this one of the original goals of the white and beige schools of this country,ерwin Have side of the Compl

319
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,300
They, that wait seating, but fine.

320
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,520


321
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,520


322
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,520


323
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,140
Here.

324
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,580
Where are they?

325
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,220
Veterans.

326
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,180
Thames.

327
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:36,180
now, by accident, said the smartest thing you have ever said in your entire life.

328
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Yes, eschew mightily that despicable fiction, that smirking personification of phoniness.

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,020
For Bob is not merely dead.

330
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,840
He never exists.

331
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,480
And I would submit that we're supporting this.

332
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,220
Excuse me, friends.

333
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,800
We had a little technical difficulty.

334
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,360
I didn't mean that wasn't a tape that we meant to play.

335
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:08,960
And I think we're going to cut to some music here until I can figure out what happened with my main show tape, my show master.

336
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,440
Oh, it's just part.

337
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,340
You'll love this music by Carl Stallings.

338
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,440
Oh, my God.

339
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,280
Oh, my God.

340
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,300
Now, I don't really claim ascendancy to the absolute throne of wisdom.

341
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,560
I do try to find the most fundamental common sense thread in any issue I have the nerve to take up and face the reality of it,

342
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
whether I like it or not, and admittedly, I often don't.

343
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,780
But unlike many, I have to let facts influence my opinion.

344
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,220
I think fantasy and wishful thinking make up the stuff of my beloved comic books.

345
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,620
And reality, on the other hand, sits there stubbornly and is unmoved by opinion or hollering,

346
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,540
although there's plenty of both to be had, flying around constantly.

347
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,420
I think the only real solution to most issues would be a complete change in human nature,

348
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,180
and that's not going to be happening anytime soon, as far as I know.

349
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,740
So, if so, I sure want a box seat, because I mostly hate human nature, even my own.

350
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,080
I mean, give me wild, unfettered, non-pink-type subgenius nature any day.

351
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,340
So, let me establish up front that I only know what some of the facts are in most situations,

352
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,000
and what I would like to see become the reality.

353
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
I don't really claim to have a solution to much of anything as such.

354
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,860
Just check out my laundry situation sometime, if you don't believe me.

355
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,100
And I think there are viable viewpoints in both of what are often just two camps,

356
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,320
although the yelling often tends to obscure them.

357
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,080
Holy mother!

358
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,420
Oh, God, it is too much!

359
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,980
You shall have it.

360
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,700
You shall have it, Connie.

361
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,440
You shall know the full measure of this stiffened machine end, sweet girl.

362
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,680
You shall wallow in an ocean of warm slack.

363
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,020
A proper and intangible aesthetic life.

364
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,140
Oh, Bob, what heavenly bliss.

365
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,600
Strip, Connie.

366
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,340
Remove everything that can interfere with our movements, which I promise you will be violent.

367
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,200
Enough.

368
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,080
Shmite this fic.

369
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,180
For Bob is not merely dead.

370
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,040
He never existed.

371
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,360
Oh, I know.

372
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,840
I know we're not supposed to admit that.

373
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,440
We're supposed to keep pretending that he's sort of real, but in a funny, joking sort of way,

374
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,700
insisting on his reality in a way that lets everyone know it's just a joke, that we don't really believe it.

375
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
Well, to heck with Bob.

376
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,620
Bob is dead.

377
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,700
There is no Bob.

378
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,400
Bob is just a made-up thing.

379
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,300
A picture of a face and nothing more.

380
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,200
Yes, it's truly.

381
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,860
Oh, no, it's not dead.

382
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,380
Beautiful.

383
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,060
Beautiful.

384
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,320
Shmite.

385
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,660
Okay.

386
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,300
Uh.

387
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,100
Uh.

388
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
And, uh.

389
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,160
It's.

390
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,340
Uh.

391
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,720
Well, the Church of the Subgenius, as always, we like to make fun of ourselves, too.

392
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,160
You know, that's what they sell.

393
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,580
Satire.

394
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,180
Or women.

395
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,640
You know?

396
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,020
Ice cream.

397
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:09,700
Oh, that feels good.

398
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,080
Oh.

399
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,360
Oh, that feels good.

400
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:20,840


401
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,660
I'm afraid of life.

402
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,340
I'm afraid of life.

403
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:26,880
Yeah.

404
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,280
I absolutely will get mad at it.

405
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,280
And before I know it, ugly pheromones are wrapping through my system and I'm ready to kill.

406
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,500
Good hello.

407
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,320
Did you have a nice day?

408
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,640
Voice and print analyzers cannot be heard in your phone.

409
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,620
Thoughtless caller redundancies cannot be heard in your phone.

410
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,900
You're a moron at your leisure time.

411
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,260
And toast.

412
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
And madness is merely moisture on the brain.

413
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,080
Game over.

414
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,500
You must learn how to drive.

415
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,480
Everything's true.

416
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,900
Um, uh...

417
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,440
Uh...

418
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,860
That was a wonderful little bit there by Puzzling Evidence Montage.

419
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,560
Those cuts, those wonderful blurs of cuts was Puzzling Evidence Materials.

420
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Then, once again, recut here at the Hour of Slack where we just can't leave anybody's stuff well enough alone.

421
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,940
We have to just carve it up into little pieces that the original artists probably go,

422
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,460
Well, they've lost all point.

423
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,360
They've just cheapened it.

424
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,820
Well, sorry.

425
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,960
That was Puzzling Evidence Cuts.

426
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:56,480
And some amazing materials from Bugs on Broadway, which was a special presentation of Bugs Bunny cartoons and especially the music of Carl Stallings.

427
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,360
I think that was done by an orchestra.

428
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,460
In front of, while the cartoons were being projected, I guess that's the kind of show that was.

429
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,280
Complete with the sound.

430
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,500
And the sound effects and the greatness of Mel Blanc.

431
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,060
Yes.

432
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:22,000
And, uh, we did hear some, uh, once again, Hell Pope Huey, uh, the extremely disgruntled.

433
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,320
And he does get worse.

434
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,620
And I, I, I, there's something, we've seen, there's been some surprises on the show, okay, friends?

435
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,400
But I think we've got everything under control now.

436
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,020
Thank you.

437
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,380
Oh!

438
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,380
Oh!

439
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,100
Oh, Bruddy!

440
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,280
Bruddly!

441
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,520
Bruddly!

442
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,060
No!

443
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,940
You're, you're suspicious now.

444
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,000
How could that be?

445
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,460
Oh, what is it?

446
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,660
Not

447
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,720
Interruptions from other shows.

448
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,780
Coming for you.

449
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,540
I did say go.

450
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
I feel it in gushes.

451
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,740
Oh, give it to me more, more.

452
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,020
Pour into me.

453
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,040
Push harder.

454
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,420
Do not spare me.

455
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,920
Oh, another gush.

456
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,160
Push.

457
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,680
Tear me if you like me.

458
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,340
Let me have all of your stuff.

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,260
You're just using me for sex.

460
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,520
And you never really love me.

461
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,120
You just love what I represent.

462
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,620
Cool, quick, nickel slick.

463
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
Bag full of tricks.

464
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,760
You get your kicks and I'm out the door.

465
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
Now I know the true meaning of hormones.

466
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,640
Exploding, loading question on top of question.

467
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,080
Man, do I feel cheap.

468
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,020
As you heat mounds and mounds of guilt.

469
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,680
My ego wheels tilting left, right, jammed in the middle.

470
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,260
Twiddle dee, twiddle dum.

471
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,900
Some friend you are with your own personal tar baby.

472
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,560
Love slave.

473
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,140
Got it made into slaves.

474
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,480
So cool you wear Ray-Bans when we do it.

475
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,620
Caught up in the myth.

476
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,300
Is it live or is it Memorex?

477
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,700
More sex, more sex, more sex, more sex.

478
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,320
You're just using me for sex, he says.

479
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,360
I mean, there will be.

480
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,240
Having sex.

481
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
And then he says it.

482
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,260
So we have to stop having sex so we can sit around talking about using each other for sex.

483
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,220
And I say, look, I am not now nor have I ever used you for sex.

484
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,640
Why do you think that?

485
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,540
What's wrong?

486
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,120
What's wrong with you?

487
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,300
What have I done?

488
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,620
Put your Tinkerbell spell on me now I can't see straight.

489
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
Send me date rape.

490
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,920
Even put me on videotape for your girlfriend to see.

491
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,660
Must be like the queen because it stings.

492
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,140
And my Eldritch Cleaver attitude mixed with your Sid Vicious mood.

493
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,640
Got some real crude stuff to go down.

494
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,020
Frowns, moan.

495
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,740
Didn't realize I was getting boned and sexually stoned to a pulp.

496
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,860
Passed a big gulp.

497
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,740
My throat is dry.

498
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,020
And why was I mesmerized by your pearl gray eyes?

499
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,300
Lacey white thighs.

500
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,840
Cries and sighs of I've lied again.

501
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,780
And when will you stop losing me, abusing me, confusing me, and using me for sex?

502
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:24,380
And he'll say, I'm just a poor black man in a wicked white world trying to keep my head hard.

503
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,860
Well, you're doing a pretty good job of that.

504
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,900
See, he says, you are.

505
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,980
You're just using me for sex.

506
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,040
No, I say, I'm not.

507
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,000
But that's the only time you aren't calling me Snow Bright.

508
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,260
Telling me my walk's tight.

509
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,080
Yeah, the only time I don't feel so completely white is when I'm having sex with you.

510
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,360
Nah, baby, you don't love me.

511
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,040
You love what I represent.

512
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,400
What do you represent?

513
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,300
I represent the antidote to your civilization.

514
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,400
Yeah, well, maybe you do.

515
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,380
But I do love you and your antidote, too.

516
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,580
Nah, baby, I know your game.

517
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,620
White people are all the same.

518
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,000
So finally I scream out, okay, then.

519
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,700
We won't have sex anymore.

520
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,260
We'll just sit around thinking pure thoughts.

521
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:16,460
And when that gets boring, we'll go out and argue in public and get arrested for disorderly interracial conduct

522
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,720
and get locked up inside a tiny, evil, foul-smelling little jail

523
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,600
and sit around thinking about how we used to use each other for sex, okay?

524
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,180
Okay, let's go to bed, yeah.

525
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,560
Oh, Maggie S'd up in huge voodoo, dear friend.

526
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,420
I'd like to watch you.

527
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,320
And I receive so much.

528
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,240
No.

529
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,260
Victory. Telepackaged. Outreach.

530
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,700
What do you expect?

531
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,300
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

532
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,880
I don't know.

533
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,820
She had the problem with the muscles.

534
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,240
April is the coolest one.

535
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,700
Breeding lilacs out of the dead land.

536
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,700
Mixing memory and desire.

537
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,940
Stirring ball roots with warm, covering art juice.

538
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,940
He said,

539
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,580
What are the roots of the flesh?

540
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,520
Only the ghetto honored the high-motsu.

541
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,380
You gave me Hyattsons first a year ago.

542
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,140
Living, not dead.

543
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,480
And I knew Madame Sesostris, famous clairvoyante.

544
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,700
Those are pearls that were his eyes.

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,560
And this card, which is blank, fear death by water.

546
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,060
If you see, dear Mrs. Equitone, kept the hours of the dead sound on the final stroke of nine,

547
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,400
mon simple appel en frere,

548
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,200
un gent powder de l'eau.

549
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,400
Before I keep going, is there anybody who needs to make a testimonial here?

550
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:50,520
If anybody at any point feels the urgent desire to stand up and brag their sins unto the crowd,

551
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,380
or say what Bob has done for them, be...

552
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,080
I used to love invertebrates, but Bob showed me the way to find true back bone of those I desire.

553
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,140
I will admit it to you.

554
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,620
Come on up here, brother.

555
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,680
Come on up here, buddy.

556
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,000
We want to hear about it.

557
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Come on up here.

558
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,880
It's true.

559
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,500
You got to stand there.

560
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,560
I used to love invertebrates, friends.

561
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,720
I used to lust over their little slimy bodies.

562
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,500
I'd see a worm on my lawn and I'd go,

563
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,240
Oh, boy, that's a cute little worm.

564
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,020
Don't step on it.

565
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,720
I didn't want to step on it because I want to squish it.

566
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,060
I want to step on it because I lusted for them invertebrates.

567
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,760
Yes, I found they didn't have them crunchy parts.

568
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,860
They can...

569
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,180
Slugs! Yes, slugs!

570
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,940
Shedding a variable.

571
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,420
Cascades of ecstasy over slugs.

572
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,820
I used to dream about slugs.

573
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,860
Big old slugs wearing spike heels and unknowable feet.

574
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,820
It was amazing.

575
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,280
Absolutely amazing.

576
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,260
And then one day, one day I was walking down the street

577
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,700
and I looked and I saw slugs everywhere.

578
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,620
I saw insects everywhere.

579
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,060
I saw Bob everywhere.

580
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,840
And he said to me,

581
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,780
Son, get some backbone.

582
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,460
Better yet, screw stuff with backbone.

583
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,840
Just tan this invertebrate.

584
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,800
Save your soul and stick within your genus and species.

585
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,700
By God, friends, Bob Dodds will show you the way to true

586
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,540
entomological screwing.

587
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,700
It'll save your lives.

588
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,560
It saved mine.

589
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,460
Thank you, Robert.

590
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,240
Thank you very much.

591
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,480
Nice!

592
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,820
Nice job!

593
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,920
Nice job!

594
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

595
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,360
Nice job!

596
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
Nice job!

597
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,360
Nice job!

598
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,260
There was no clue to her species, yet I loved her nonetheless.

599
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,360
Ah!

600
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,140
He's fucking good!

601
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,700
He's fucking good!

602
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,080
Ew!

603
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm a dick, dick, dick!

604
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,300
And boy, this I tell you.

605
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,380
Oh, I know.

606
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,100
I know most of you will not accept this.

607
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:39,480
Most of you just can't feel comfortable in a phony joke cult with no joke to it anymore.

608
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:46,020
Most of you need something just a little bit different from all the things you mock and

609
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,580
despise.

610
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,780
The same, except for a few minor changes so that it won't be too scary and weird and unfamiliar.

611
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,940
Something, something with yet another martyred messiah, another is-he-alive-or-dead mystery,

612
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,000
even though you claim to hate all the other ones.

613
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:09,400
Yes, you need a safe, fake Jesus to yuck it up over because you aren't really sure that

614
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,580
the real Jeezy are as safe and fake as you wish and hope they are.

615
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,660
You aren't absolutely positive that you won't burn in hell for saying the wrong thing or

616
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,820
doing the wrong thing or going to the wrong church or wearing the wrong uniform.

617
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,440
So you have to keep the, keep the very tip of one toenail over the threshold of belief

618
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,540
just to be safe, just in case.

619
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,780
How disgusting.

620
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,280
But that's really what the stupid pipe face is for, isn't it?

621
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:50,080
To trick the weaklings into revealing themselves so the real subgeni, the true yeti and yeti-et,

622
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,820
will not have to waste their precious time on sorry pink bobfans.

623
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,280
Except to use that ugly face as a target in the last minutes before boarding time on exchange.

624
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,280
When we will be permitted to cut loose with our weapon of choice on all the suckers pressed up against the force field,

625
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,240
waving their membership cards and pointing to that face on their T-shirts as if to say,

626
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,040
Me! Me! Shoot me first!

627
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,180
Ha! This stern and manly mouth fills with a bilious tang at the thought of such stupidity.

628
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,380
So many fools, so little firepower.

629
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,980
As you can see, I get a little riled when I see

630
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,260
globe-spanning displays of idiocy.

631
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,240
Nitwicked, congratulating themselves on their intelligence for being the first to pay for the opportunity

632
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,360
to jump from one frying pan right into another smaller, slightly hotter one

633
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,480
without so much as a non-stick patina of burned-on grease.

634
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:57,480
So not only do they still fry, they also stick and little bits of them get ripped off

635
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,420
when the huge spatula comes down to flip them over and press the other side.

636
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,740
And then they slide down to get seared real good.

637
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,660
Okay, you just, uh...

638
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,420
You work off of that. That'll give you some idea of how to punctuate these things.

639
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,980
Boy.

640
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,240
Thirsty work, Raven. Thirsty work.

641
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
Franken-big.

642
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,120
Cup of tea out of my hillbilly humor giant coffee mug. Ha ha.

643
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,500
You're probably pretty familiar with hillbillies down there, eh? Ha ha ha.

644
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,220
Okay, here we are getting our frappee up.

645
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,660
Frappee.

646
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh my god. I must be a subgenius. I'm talking about frappee.

647
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,140
Um, they got this...

648
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,180
They got this Bigfoot bookstore here.

649
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
It's up in North Portland.

650
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,500
Which is kinda...

651
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,420
North Portland, you know.

652
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,360
Oh, you live in North Portland? Oh, man.

653
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
It's not that bad.

654
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,560
At a truck stop here in Memphis

655
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,360
The strings, they were a-pullin'

656
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,800
A man stepped out and walked into the sun

657
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,760
And everybody hollered

658
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,340
About his shoes and collar

659
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,020
And when the crowd began to shift

660
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,600
He began to run

661
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,340
Yeah, the hound dog became famous

662
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,240
Decided to join the army

663
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,160
When they shaved his head

664
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,060
And watched it on TV

665
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
He received all kinds of letters

666
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,160
The ladies found him charming

667
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,960
And all the people said

668
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,180
Bless old Colin King

669
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,740
And he would say

670
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:04,740


671
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,760
And what will Elvis think

672
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,160
When he sees Bob?

673
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,220
And he finds he is not the king

674
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,480
There will be no songs to play

675
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,920
Not by the old heartthrob

676
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,480
What will Elvis think

677
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,260
When he sees Bob?

678
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,320
Well, he played all over Vegas

679
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,160
He made a lot of movies

680
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,280
And he always drove a brand new Cadillac

681
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,140
But what has he got

682
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,900
If he owns this world

683
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,720
And he dies without one ounce of slack

684
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,820
So often is the story

685
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,380
One's rise and fall to glory

686
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,480
What makes the man will break the man one day

687
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,420
When I do not know the reasons

688
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,140
It's not a happy ending

689
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,160
As I stand here while they carry him away

690
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,260
Yeah, the last time that I saw him

691
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,480
I always will remember

692
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,580
He was lying still

693
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,800
He did not say

694
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,900
He did not say a thing

695
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,780
And we covered him with flowers

696
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,520
But it was no pretty picture

697
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,460
When we lay to rest

698
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,760
The hound dog we call king

699
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,200
And what will Elvis think

700
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,600
When he sees Bob

701
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,720
And he finds he is not the king

702
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,880
There'll be no songs to play

703
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,780
Not a song to play

704
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,520
Not by the old heartthrob

705
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,820
What will Elvis think

706
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,180
When he sees Bob

707
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,600
Well, now the stage is empty

708
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,380
Elvis left the building

709
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,820
But we're hoping

710
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,700
That the band might strike a note

711
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,240
But when the hand of time

712
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,720
Laid down that old guitar

713
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,860
Bob said, this is all she wrote

714
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,760
And he said, this is all she wrote

715
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,720
She played us a song

716
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,020
The know Madam Gotta weight up

717
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,320
That the old mater ghost

718
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,520
Have you ever realised

719
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,080
Sometimes have perhaps

720
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,120
Drunk British lose

721
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,880
Just the day

722
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,900
But we never stop

723
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:45,900


724
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,320
We ring we ring

725
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,980
think when he sees ball

726
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,940
Your heart will bump

727
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,780
your nerves will paralyze

728
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,240
as you shall hear the strangest things

729
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,860
that never met your eyes

730
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,700
They're not that strange, Al

731
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,040
Yes, you'll travel into the chilly

732
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,240
thrilling, slimy, haunted

733
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,760
radio station

734
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,820
Just sign on the dotted line

735
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,420
little boys and girls

736
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,640
And now you've bought an interest in the

737
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine

738
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,920
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine

739
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,900
running through these rocks and I want you boys

740
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,880
to have every opportunity to become shareholders

741
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,580
in this money-making project

742
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,100
Now don't bother to read it, just sign your name

743
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,420
on the dotted line and

744
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,900
by soon you'll be a beefsteak tycoon

745
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,280
I promise you that

746
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,340
Lovely, yes, it is

747
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,620
This is Pastor Bucknaked here

748
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,360
I was just counseling a young lady and

749
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,820
I gave her her own

750
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,660
personal mantra

751
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,160
which is to say this to herself

752
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,360
15 times or more

753
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
maybe for a half hour

754
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,720
Who gives a

755
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,280
Who gives a

756
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,560
Who, right

757
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,080
Now friends, I want you to keep that sort of a philosophy in mind

758
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,440
That's right

759
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,160
Because that's a forgiveness kind of philosophy

760
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,420
a who cares kind of forgiveness

761
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,240
That's right, doctor

762
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,360
So, we will be cutting

763
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,120
That's not

764
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,480
No, no, we want

765
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,640
That's why we're here for forgiveness, Doctor

766
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:14,640


767
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,620
We want people giving us things

768
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,500
And we want people to bring those things down to the station

769
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,080
Yeah, this is a religion of

770
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,520
We're asking for forgiveness of everything

771
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,660
We want forgiveness from you and for us

772
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,020
and hate from you for the conspiracy

773
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,040
That's right

774
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,380
The conspiracy that makes you not understand what we're talking about

775
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,980
Because if it weren't for them, why

776
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,880
It would be nothing on the air in Dallas

777
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
except sub-genius shows

778
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,600
And you may groan to think

779
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,060
think such a nightmarish thought

780
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,920
But actually the

781
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,160
We've decided

782
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,280
Listen to them

783
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,740
Even the sub-genius doctors themselves

784
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,880
in terrible, terrible pain

785
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,240
We're near death here

786
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,800
And believe me, we can't just ask you to walk out and kill normals

787
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,300
We can't ask you to do that kind of thing on this station

788
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,520
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs

789
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:04,620
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs

790
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,560
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs

791
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,300
No, because it's against the law

792
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,100
It's against the law for us to do those things

793
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,920
Gary, would you get the show off Reverend Onan's foot

794
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,600
I think it's perfect

795
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,680
Oh man, the show

796
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,160
I don't want to touch that show

797
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,760
You know what happened last time I stuck my finger in the show

798
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Well friends, we don't want to be talking about that

799
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,000
It's just something wrong

800
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,400
But uh

801
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,700
We do also have

802
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,680
Dr. Onan Canobite

803
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,620
of the amazing sub-genius band

804
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,840
Dr. Onan's Wotan Band

805
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,280
as well as the famous occupant

806
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:37,620
Yes

807
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,460
Yes, you can hear

808
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,960
Now, Dr. Onan is only a tape recording

809
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,040
Yes

810
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,200
And yet at the same time

811
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,880
See, we've got a crowded show tonight

812
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,460
We have over a hundred guests

813
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,540
Over ten thousand

814
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,040
And too many listeners

815
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,900
I don't think we can cram the show into that many radios

816
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,620
Keep it quiet here, we don't have enough room

817
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,020
It's going to thin out

818
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,160
If we try to reach too many listeners

819
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,240
it will just dilute it

820
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,620
Now, a sub-genius church can be a franchise

821
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,080
in your own area

822
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,680
And it's also called

823
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,280
in church jargon

824
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,240
it's called a clench

825
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,420
It's called a clench

826
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,220
Now, Onan was the one who figured out

827
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,340
who started his own solo clench

828
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,040
and it schismed all over itself

829
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,240
So tell us about that

830
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,980
That's what you're most famous for in town

831
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,560
I want you to know that

832
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,620
I see, yes

833
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,080
The solos

834
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,160
The stark fists acting upon a solo clench

835
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,820
resulting in ultimate schism

836
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,060
And friends, we're going to talk about that

837
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,500
And friends, you know, most of these religions

838
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,860
most of these religions

839
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,380
they indulge in tremendous

840
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,480
in-fighting between denominations

841
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,840
We encourage

842
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,960
in-fighting between denominations

843
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,280
No two sub-genius denominations

844
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,960
should ever dominate one another

845
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,240
especially not if they're the same

846
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,980
And if any two sub-geniuses are the same

847
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,040
one must die

848
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,880
because this is

849
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,960
it's different

850
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,400
I was going to ask, Dr. Onan

851
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,780
were you the one that had the first church in the round?

852
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,840
No, that was just hearsay

853
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,280
just rumor

854
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,240
Oh, it's Reverend Hearsay

855
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,640
Yes, Reverend Hearsay

856
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,400
These are the kind of things that we can't say on a radio station

857
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,040
KPFA in Berkeley, California

858
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,240
These are the kind of guests that we can't have on our station

859
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,120
Yes, but KNON is a non-station, you see

860
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,160
And because of that

861
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,400
we can get away with things that they would never suspect anyone of

862
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
We can get away with things that they would never suspect anyone of

863
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,120
Watching but can't quite believe it

864
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,340
Watching but can't quite believe it

865
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,720
I'm just a little bit emotional

866
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,060
She's a stark cunt

867
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,760
I have to let the speaking turn on her

868
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,940
Don't say hello

869
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,860
No, no, no

870
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,000
This program

871
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,820
Oh, God, don't say hello

872
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,900
Oh, God, I didn't do it

873
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,960
Of course not

874
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,520
Good, hello

875
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,760
Volume, rate, pitch, emphasis and enunciation

876
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,660
What was that?

877
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,500
Are you in any sort of trouble?

878
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,220
Well, I certainly didn't understand that operator

879
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:02,760
Good

880
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,960
It's very frightening

881
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,460
Those are very frightening thoughts

882
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,140
Are you frightened?

883
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,900
Sometimes we have thoughts that are so frightening

884
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,100
we can't even admit to ourselves that we have them

885
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,240
The only way we can deal with those thoughts

886
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,940
The only way we can deal with those thoughts

887
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,820
is to believe that

888
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,320
somebody else has them

889
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,840
Let me do that

890
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,620
It's not reality yet

891
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,280
But it's part

892
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,340
But it's part

893
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,960
Attention, attention

894
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,760
Mankind's efforts to tame madness

895
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,500
make a fascinating history

896
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,880
For this caller

897
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,480
And you can just hum along

898
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,420
What do you prescribe for my impotency, Doctor?

899
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,900
Well, I suggest you press that subgenius alert button that's just right behind you

900
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,420
It was in the dreary autumn of the year 1889

901
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,980
When I called on my good friend Puzzling Evidence

902
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,700
Can't fall down

903
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,560
I'm dancing and I can't fall down

904
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,080
Well, I bet that song made everybody laugh real hard

905
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,740
I'm a white man and I can't get down

906
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,880
I can't get down

907
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,080
I can't find it

908
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,940
I've fallen and I can't get up

909
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,840
Has this ever happened to you?

910
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,680
Well, don't worry

911
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,640
With subgenius alert

912
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,640
One simply wears this medallion around one's neck

913
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:21,880
One simply wears this medallion around one's neck

914
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,380
And when there's

915
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,700
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

916
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,700
Press the little subgenius signal

917
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,200
And you're cool

918
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,440
Yes, you're playing with

919
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,020
Cry for help, you're pathetic, monophobic

920
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,000
Your pain will be broadcast to subgeniuses everywhere

921
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,760
Your pain will be broadcast to subgeniuses everywhere

922
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,160
So that you may know

923
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,640
That your suffering was not in vain

924
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,360
Yes, you may be in agony

925
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,500
With a broken, cracked hip

926
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,900
On the floor of your apartment

927
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,620
Unable to stop your pet poodle

928
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,440
From chewing your eyes out

929
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,720
But you'll know

930
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,980
That you're providing hours of amusement

931
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,880
To a subgenius somewhere

932
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,860
To a subgenius somewhere

933
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,120
My god, her poodle's chewing out her eyes

934
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,920
That's right, for only $12.95

935
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,340
A month plus service installation charge

936
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,020
Some genius alert

937
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,120
Can be yours

938
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,460
I've fallen, and I can't get up

939
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, look at his face

940
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,960
I've fallen, and I can't get up

941
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,080
I've fallen

942
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,080


943
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,080


944
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,980
And I can't get up

945
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,480
I've fallen, and I can't get up

946
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,220
Y'all get up grandma

947
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,680
There's no humor in heaven

948
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,180
Naida, naida

949
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,980
They just say, beginning tomorrow morning

950
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,740
I'm passing a new law which will remove the barrier and take away the obstacle?

951
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,700
Did he do it by giving us a new teaching?

952
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,660
Did he do it by laying hands on the sick and healing them of their physical diseases?

953
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,760
Not at all.

954
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,240
That's not the case.

955
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,980
So it's mostly a matter of that lazy American syndrome at work again.

956
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,820
I mean, come on, guys, you can handle this stuff.

957
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,240
I have ten thumbs and I can't handle it.

958
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,760
But I have a wife who can, so, I mean, what's the big deal?

959
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,840
And making products more consumer-oriented.

960
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,120
Lord, half of them talk to you already.

961
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,400
I mean, what do you want?

962
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,720
Liquid crystal window the size of your wallet, not big enough?

963
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,280
Need help waving that VCR wand over that UPC doodad in the TV guide

964
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,480
so you can record lifestyles of the overpaid and vacuous?

965
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,260
I mean, you know, I swear, most people act as if they're one step removed from Egyptian royalty

966
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,740
having to have their grapes peeled by slaves.

967
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,400
Eh.

968
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,920
Only instant gratification I really want is the warm feeling that comes over me

969
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,620
when I take, say, a phone answering machine,

970
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,120
a wang in the back of the head that pathetic soul

971
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,380
who's outwitted by 32 kilobytes of memory chip and a cassette recorder.

972
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,720
Give me a break.

973
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,520
So, well, I don't know.

974
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,960
Despite my utter inability to build a birdhouse any self-respecting bird would reside in,

975
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,100
it kind of makes me feel like a Nobel Prize-bearing genius

976
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,000
when I hear about someone scratching their head over a VCR manual

977
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,380
I can crack during two reading sessions in the bathroom.

978
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,400
Oh, Lord.

979
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,780
If your own brain isn't user-friendly by now,

980
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,440
just give up and send all your electronic stuff to me,

981
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,220
and I'll be glad to put them through their paces,

982
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,180
relieving you of the burden of making them go.

983
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,360
I don't know.

984
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,620
It's just too darn easy to do.

985
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm sorry.

986
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,220
It sort of bugs me.

987
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,540
I just don't want to hear about it.

988
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,700
I don't know.

989
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,520
I mean, in the case of the aforementioned synthesizers and et cetera,

990
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:28,480
admittedly, a lot of the equipment around KARN borders on being steam-driven in some cases,

991
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,100
but it's not that...

992
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,640
hard.

993
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,500
I think a lot of it just stems from, like, what Robert Kiyosaki had to say a couple of weeks ago.

994
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,340
Americans are so taught to have to get the right answer.

995
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,260
Well, the only way you learn what the right thing is

996
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,960
is to do the wrong thing a few times.

997
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,160
That's true of everything from running your VCR

998
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,240
to paying your bills to your sex life.

999
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,700
You know, every darn thing requires that you make a few mistakes in the learning process.

1000
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,520
What toddler do you know who got up and began doing a pirouette right away?

1001
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, no.

1002
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,740
They had to fall on their behind about five billion times

1003
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,240
before they figured out where that little...

1004
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,380
...

1005
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:00,380


1006
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,540
central balancing gyroscope was in their head

1007
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,700
and learn how to make it all roll, okay?

1008
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,360
So give yourself a break.

1009
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:12,500
Give yourself a break, dear friends,

1010
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,200
and I'm going to give...

1011
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,500
Yep, the greatest type in the universe is coming up,

1012
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,840
but I do need to give credits real quickly here,

1013
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,620
and, of course, the sacred post office box, as I promised.

1014
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,760
The very beginning of this...

1015
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,620
...last half hour, we heard Maggie Estep and Huge Voodoo and Reggie,

1016
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,620
I think both of them doing the...

1017
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,880
Well, using you, friends, for listening.

1018
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,180
Some more psychoacoustics from Reverend Sly

1019
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,900
and Father Angus McGamora.

1020
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,680
Puzzling evidence montages.

1021
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,860
Some more ranting from the Starwood Festival.

1022
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,020
Well, that's...

1023
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,240
Lovely.

1024
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,080
Sad, sad old...

1025
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,380
The old sad stuff there, that song,

1026
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,160
When Elvis Met Bob,

1027
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,340
by John Dajon.

1028
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,220
Yeah.

1029
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,080
We could have saved Hank, friends.

1030
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,240
Some old KPFA subgenius show material

1031
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,980
with Dr. Howell, G. Gordon Gort.

1032
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,040
Oh, and Hour of Slut number three.

1033
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,640
Butt Naked and Gary the Broke Friend,

1034
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,380
Onan Kempis,

1035
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,920
Cannabite,

1036
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,120
and even G. Gordon Gort.

1037
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,720
Yeah, them were the old days or something.

1038
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,600
And even...

1039
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,800
You even got to hear a little bit of Palmer Vreedies on KPFA

1040
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:48,160
with his subgenius alert and collar pain technology.

1041
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:55,320
And friends, if you need to know more about the mighty and hideous church of the subgenius,

1042
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,240
please write to this number I'm about to give you.

1043
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,320
It's real simple, but you do need a pen.

1044
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,840
And that's just...

1045
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,080
What?

1046
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:10,320
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306

1047
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,800
in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1048
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,720
I'm going to give that again,

1049
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,500
because I know you just ain't that quick on the uptake, are you?

1050
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,460
It's Box 140306.

1051
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,040
And I know you got the Dallas, Texas part.

1052
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,220
You can tell just by listening.

1053
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,660
And that zip is, once again, 75214.

1054
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:41,480
Yeah, we'd love to play the uncut hour of slack in your ears,

1055
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,060
but now this.

1056
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,840

1071
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:30,400


1072
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,740
What do they do when Mrs. Peepee?

1073
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,420
When skies are drippy?

1074
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:37,920
Oh!

1075
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,640
And what do they do in Tijuana

1076
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,020
when they want to snuggle tight?

1077
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,100
Well, look.

1078
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,960
Music, Hayden.

1079
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,900
And Pepper, she's a fancy stepper when she dances.

1080
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,680
Go and see her as she gives us in Francis.

1081
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,780
What's up, Doc?

1082
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,440
Hmm. Also a rabbit hater.

1083
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,640
Oh, well.

1084
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,180
Shh, shh, shh.

1085
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,220
Uh-oh.

1086
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,600
Of course you know this means war.

1087
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,160
Acoustically perfect.

1088
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,820
Help! Help! Get me out of here!

1089
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,540
Ladies and gentlemen, there will be an unavoidable interruption in the program.

1090
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,200
Break into a van till we get back, maestro.

1091
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,900
Have you fixed up in a jiffy?

1092
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,540
The show must go on, you know. That's the sacred tradition.

1093
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,120
Now let's see about a little something for that throat.

1094
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,720
Open wide. That's the nice fat opera singer.

1095
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,880
Go on, go on. That's your cue.

1096
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:50,160
Oh, Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones! Wait! Oh, please, wait! Oh, Mr. Jones!

1097
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,140
Frankie and Perry just aren't in it. You're my swooner dreamboat lover boy.

1098
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,080
May I have your autograph? Please?

1099
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,100
Oh, may I? Oh!

1100
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,140
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

1101
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,400
Leopold! Leopold!

1102
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,400
Leopold! Leopold! Leopold! Leopold! Leopold! Leopold!

1103
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,420
Leopold!
