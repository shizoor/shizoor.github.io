1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Let's hear about that radio show!

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,980
Amazing, isn't it?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,960
Listen.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,800
I'm wondering about that voice we heard on the radio.

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,320
Uh, I think, hmm...

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
The color of these hot butter rum martinis.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,680
I'd like to talk about...

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,780
And here's the only person listening to the show tonight.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,300
Yeah, I'm coming.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,480
Okay, good.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,500
Look at this surface seating and bumping.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,420
There's enormous bubbles.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,420
See, the rest of our listeners are machines like this.

14
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,340
Look up to the top.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,960
They made so much money in their regular day jobs

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
that they were able to fend off these legal problems for years.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,440
Rely on your intelligence and on your memory.

18
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,340
And think about the case as it was.

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,160
You have to say the underlying word correctly.

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,680
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,100
So there.

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,300
Bang.

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,880
Put a dual display on.

24
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,220
Uh, uh, over to you.

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,300
Uh...

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,900
Puzzling.

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,680
Kill me.

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,220
Huh?

29
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,320
Kill me.

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,560
Kill me.

31
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,100
I know what you're saying.

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,300
Kill me!

33
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,520
Okay!

34
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,540
Why not?

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,740
Good luck.

36
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:19,080
Oh, uh, no, in fact, I'm not ready at all.

37
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:26,220
Uh, uh, I am, uh, and I, uh, I, uh...

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,760
Oh, goodness me.

39
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,900
Uh, I have no idea how I came by this number.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,060
I've, I am at present having numbers, uh, uh, Dr. Howe.

41
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,560
I mean, uh, I don't sound like him at all.

42
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:40,960
I know.

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm presently having phone numbers dialed at random by this, uh, scumbag person who

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,220
I'm allowing to use my phone at the present time.

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,320
And he is taking over everything and dialing up people and appears to be dialing up doctors of the air.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,740
For some strange reason.

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,680
I guess him being a phone person, he can do that.

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,860
Um, it's too bad I couldn't talk to you under the better context because I am, in fact, a great fan of the subgenius church.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,080
And, um, but my friend, when I mentioned that, began dialing these numbers and putting me on the phone and then running away.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,260
And I am extremely annoyed by all this.

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,640
However, he is no friend of mine.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,280
And I hope sincerely you will do your best to erase your memory of all this.

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,300
And can merely continue to remember.

54
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
And make the shows as bad as you can.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,060
And abuse the callers and listen for Guy the caller because he will be waiting to be abused more than the rest.

56
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,800
Woo! Woo!

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,760
There we go.

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,740
There's a universe somewhere.

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,860
Somewhere out there where there's a show.

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:51,540
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
Our house.

62
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,020
What?

63
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,300


64
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,480
Welcome potential performers and adept at playing напр Affordable Migrations.

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,700
lace inquiries and make my talk!

66
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,320
The end.

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,920
Well, we have a ball with enough'll Harris!

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,460
To start a show.

69
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,180
By being frantic and quotes the dark.

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,800
The 단 anniversary of the concert.

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
There he is.

72
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay, now Philo's gone crazy in Production Studio 1.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,580
Looks like they're isolating the area, pulling the doctors out of there.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,280
Well, they don't have long to live here on KPFA.

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,020
I'll tell you that.

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,800
Or here on 8405.

77
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,340
8405.

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,020
8405.

79
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:43,940
9374.

80
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,400
That doesn't give it in.

81
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:53,900
8405.

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
8405.

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
8405.

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
8405.

85
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,520
8405.

86
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,660
8405.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,240
While Dr. Sparrow was farming skulls in the sun

88
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,220
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,380
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

90
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,440
The band that cared not was speaking its name

91
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,720
While the doctors on the clamshell were claiming their fame

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Sparkdog explosion and combo gang fun

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,520
Finished their sin just in time for life

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,760
And we got hearts so high

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,320
Like dark clouds out there

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,940
Yeah, we got hearts so high

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,220
Like dark clouds out there

98
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:40,900
. . .

99
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,320
. . .

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,400
. . .

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,880
. . . .

102
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,980
Ah, yes, dear friends, the swinging love corpses.

103
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope.

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,420
Better make it to Doc Doc, or just give up hope.

105
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,300
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear.

106
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,500
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear.

107
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,560
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped.

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm gonna go back to smoke the ultimate frown.

109
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,000
You just can't imagine what it's like to go when reality's on hold.

110
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,260
And Doc Doc's the show, we go high, go high.

111
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,200
We go high, go high.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Doc Doc.

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,480
Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, well, I'm Doc Doc now.

115
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
I climbed down, I climbed up all the way to the top.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,500
I took everything you could think of.

117
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,940
I shot beer.

118
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,480
I smoked heroin.

119
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,480
I snorted marijuana.

120
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,080
I stuck, I stuck a stiff glue.

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:29,380
I put the barbiturate suppositories in my rectal cavity.

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,360
Uh, yes, dear friends, and Dr. Drummond can't tell you everything else that he did, because

123
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,260
you just don't even want to know.

124
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,580
The swinging love corpse is there, live, somewhere, from the album Soak Your Butt.

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,560
And, well, we're, at last, we've been defending the Church of the Subgenius so much, lately,

126
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,460
we're just gonna tear it to pieces tonight.

127
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,060
And, you know, that means it's one of those old-fashioned doctor shows.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,380
Oh, you hear, be hearing from all those mighty nasty characters, particularly Puzzling Evidence,

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
Dr. Howell.

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,960
The show opened, by the way, with a nice little new edit by Puzzling Evidence.

131
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,700
There's a lot more of that coming up.

132
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,220
Um, oh, yeah.

133
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,240
Oh, okay.

134
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,080
Okay.

135
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,200
Okay.

136
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,300
Okay.

137
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:40,580
Well, uh, sir, ma'am, most of this episode is from 1993, and therefore wonderfully old

138
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,020
school.

139
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,540
But I, Stang, am talking now from just before New Year's Day 2022, so-called.

140
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:49,540


141
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:49,540


142
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,240
2022.

143
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,600
Uh, so, uh, happy holidays.

144
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
Mine were largely terrible.

145
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,260
Cause I've been sick.

146
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,600
Actually, not so much sick as injured.

147
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,020
It's temporary.

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
But I keep having setbacks.

149
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Uh, sometimes it results in involuntary slack, where I get to sit in bed watching TV all

150
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,640
day.

151
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,400
Other times it results in pain, where I have to sit in bed watching TV all day.

152
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,460
And I'd much rather be walking my dogs and making new shows and books.

153
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,820
But these old shows are better than nothing and possibly better than new.

154
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,020
Anyway, it was arthritis and back injuries.

155
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:46,360
And just as I was getting those under control, I developed an infection, a swollen cyst-like

156
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,060
entity that was so evil.

157
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,160
I named it Conky.

158
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,420
Not decent.

159
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,940
Conky's been exorcised, but Jesus Murphy, there's a huge haunted hole in my back where

160
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,480
Conky's angry ghost is still stirring up trouble and it's seriously stomach-turning to look

161
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,740
at.

162
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,800
And I'll be seeing doctors all month.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,220
And then my kitty Dolomite got his own Conky infection.

164
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,680
But this old episode is really funny and not half as old as me.

165
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,960
Onan and I are working on some new books too.

166
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,380
That's Dobbs.town and Subgenius.com.

167
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:32,220
I removed something really stupid from this old show, Bob Dean, to make room for this

168
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,580
update.

169
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,880
So take it away, doctors.

170
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,460
So I don't know, they better do something fast.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,180
You take it to the top.

172
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,140
And what happens to it's going to happen to you.

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,020
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go, no one's ever walked up to me

174
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,380
and said, hey, you want to buy some cigarettes?

175
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,160
Acuérdeme, Rubén, al ratito.

176
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,400
Decae mi teléfono.

177
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,480
De meterlo al toilet.

178
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,780
Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.

179
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,440
Can't sit and negotiate.

180
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,380
Can I do it?

181
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,560
If you don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you're going to die.

182
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,940
And I know all the reasons for it.

183
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,180
I know every single reason for it.

184
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,220
I'm free.

185
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm out of town.

186
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,000
Keeps me out of town.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000


197
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,220
Then you have the basic honk.

198
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,520
And the goose honk.

199
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,560
I'll be giving to every a dog in the service.

200
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Where a dog out there?

201
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,960
Just what you calling?

202
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,960
You're able to pick it up in a hurry.

203
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,180
Yoyo.

204
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,840
Rub-de-dub-dub all day long.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,020
Because every day becoming much more practical for my inspiration.

206
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,160
But I'm fascinated to know that.

207
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,680
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra ball.

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,780
Bob, what a relief. How are you doing tonight?

209
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,840
His name is Bob. Bob is not the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson. Take it from me.

210
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,300
Billy G is not Mr. Bob.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,080
Come on, half-body. Come on, Bob. How many poses do you think is for Michael? Bob. Come on, Bob. Come on.

212
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,640
Will seven be enough, Bob?

213
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,420
They call him Bob Dubs.

214
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,120
Yeah, I call him Bobo.

215
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,900
He was the leather man at a time when leather was nothing but wingtip shoes.

216
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,860
He led the way, brothers.

217
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,380
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.

218
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:41,660
I remember.

219
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,060
At first, a footloose, sore-footed shoe salesman.

220
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,660
One day, he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design.

221
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,840
When he messed around with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil that we call the divine immaculation.

222
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,160
But, you know, his very name rings with magic.

223
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,980
Half human, half sprite, he saw the future and could transform himself into any form.

224
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,200
Merely by conjuring up the image in his mind.

225
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,900
The great gods used his mystical powers to aid the forces of righteousness, honor, and virtue.

226
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,740
Gesundheit.

227
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,620
And to shape the splendid visions of his noble king, Stan.

228
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:29,500
But when the tragic end of Dobstown drew near, many say that the heart-sick Dob sought refuge with a tiny, tiddling poodle.

229
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:40,180
She gave him comfort and sheltered him in a tree to rest safely until needed by the show once more.

230
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,860
What's going on here?

231
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?

232
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,620
Yeah, why don't we?

233
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:45,720
Oh, Bob.

234
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,180
Oh, Bob.

235
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,100
It's later than you think.

236
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:58,980
Aye, the terrible, spittin' vengeance of Bob's mighty staff shall scour clean this planet in the all-pervading radioactive pastiche of his boundless supernatural love.

237
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:06,720
Wake up, open your heart, drop your pants, close your mind, and bend over because he'll be kicking and taking names.

238
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,520
Dear brothers and sisters, he'll be struggling and gasping.

239
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
His face will turn blue.

240
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,700
Then Bob will pitch over on the floor in the grip of a massive coronet.

241
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:15,940
This happens on mèreими's

242
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,520
cabin, and the ophthalmologist will treat all the buscaratists Para and will handle the exterminatory thrombosis.

243
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,520
And we will be there to see that event and to record it for you-

244
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,460
And that's the way we like it.

245
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,440
As it was at the beginning of time.

246
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,420
I saw a man with a pop and a grin.

247
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,240
Old in the new morning light.

248
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
Grinning, come on, sing along now.

249
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,820
Grinning with me like a mad waggonbilcy made me uptight.

250
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,760
I told him, don't bother me anymore.

251
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,700
But he left me alone in a joyous woe.

252
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,700


253
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,700


254
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,700


255
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,700


256
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,820
But he kept on just the same

257
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,120
Till I was totally brainwashed

258
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,860
Bob is his name

259
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,660
Bob is my story

260
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,040
Bob is my song

261
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,840
Bob's my amphetamine

262
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,660
So all the day long

263
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Doo-doo-doo-doo

264
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,100
I won't tear my poster of Bob's down

265
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,840
I'll feel no sadness or shame

266
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,160
Till I behold him in Dobbs Town

267
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,000
Bob is his name

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,460
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

269
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,420
He has no lack of his patented slack

270
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,240
For those of his following fold

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,440
He is the friend of whoever will send

272
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,400
Greenbacks a-gold

273
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,620
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

274
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,260
He's growing stronger and stronger

275
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,080
He'll get on the ground

276
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,560
And have all the credit and blame

277
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,380
I'll be a big boy no longer

278
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,420
Bob is his name

279
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,900
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

280
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,620
Yes, it is a sad affair

281
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,920
My Bob's bigger than yours

282
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,220
My Bob's bigger than your big Bob

283
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,100
My Bob's better than yours

284
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,200
Watch out! The Bob! It's loose!

285
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,300
It's coming this way!

286
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,260
Back! Back! I created you!

287
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Back! Back!

288
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Back!

289
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,740
Back! Back!

290
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,120
Back! Back!

291
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,640
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs' divine immaculation.

292
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,880
All information was revealed to Dobbs in this blinding flash of knowledge,

293
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,560
which occurred, as every true subgenius and every schoolboy knows,

294
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,280
when he was working back in the 50s on an experimental television set of his own design.

295
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
The computer was 100% redundant.

296
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,140
He was messing around with the back of a TV set and it was suddenly immaculated.

297
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,120
The light-strong amplifier and multiplexed the aural invigilance

298
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,020
Don't give it away. Don't tell them. Let them figure it out for themselves.

299
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,060
Bob arrived at the mountaintop location. He found the transmitter to be operating properly.

300
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,400
Normally, it would return a system to standard operating rhythm.

301
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh, you're giving away church secrets. This is what it's like.

302
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,780
Don't listen to him. He's giving away church secrets.

303
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Don't listen. Don't listen. Don't listen.

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,200
The transmitter designed to suck contactability found through visual interaction.

305
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,960
Does Alice figure any of this?

306
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,420
Alice? Alice? I don't know Alice.

307
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,700
Alice, you shut down all the power to the visual transmitter associated with 22kVBD.

308
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,940
You're fading out. You can't triangulate on your signal. Speak into the rectifier.

309
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,060
Unfortunately, the visual and aural power supplies are identical in appearance and he mistakenly opened the aural system.

310
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,420
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.

311
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,840
The man is concerned. He's going to blow up.

312
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,820
I'm out of contact. He's out of control.

313
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,980
He's got a mind of his own.

314
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm going to throw my piece across the concrete and I'm going to make contact.

315
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:53,820
Don't pull your love out on me, baby. If you do, then I think that maybe I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years.

316
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:03,180
Don't pull your love out on me, honey. Take my heart, my soul, my money. But don't leave me here drowning in my tears.

317
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:12,960
You say you're going to leave. Going to take that big wide turn. Going to fly right out of here without a single word.

318
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,140
But you know you'll break my heart when I watch you close that door.

319
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,220
Because I know I won't see you anymore.

320
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:32,840
Don't pull your love out on me, baby. If you do, then I think that maybe I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years.

321
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,120
Don't pull your love out on me, honey. Take my heart, my soul, my money. But don't leave me here drowning in my tears.

322
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,640
Haven't I been good to you? What about that brand new ring? Doesn't that mean love to you?

323
00:19:49,940 --> 00:20:00,280
Doesn't that mean anything? Did I throw away my pride? Had I got down on my knees? Would you make me beg you for a degree?

324
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,220
There's so much I want to do. I've got love enough for two. But I'll never choose a girl if I don't have you.

325
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,040
Yeah!

326
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,520
Oh no you don't. Oh no you don't, Rudy.

327
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,760
Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friends.

328
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,680
Whooping away in the background there. Joe Newman, our beloved friend Joe Newman.

329
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,200
Whooping that out. On his Rudy Schwartz Project album.

330
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,120
The Rudy Schwartz Project. Don't get charred. Get puffy.

331
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,840
And uh...

332
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,600
Oh no.

333
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm trying to switch that off.

334
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,500
Yeah. Tell you what's been going on.

335
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,400
Uh, since the last time I talked I ran an edit of just some, well, radio shorts you might call them.

336
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,380
Radio shorts by Radio Shorts or Brain Rock West. Our new friends out there in San Francisco.

337
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,940
Cutting some...

338
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,880
Wild radio stuff. And then some more KPFA. Dr. Howl. Howling away in the airwaves.

339
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,320
Um, from the edits by Phineas Narco. If you ever, uh, encounter...

340
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,860
You'll notice that one in your, uh, Subgenius catalog. Uh, reference to that tape.

341
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:53,180
And what we're hearing in the background right now. And what I think I'm going to let carry us over to, uh, side two of show.

342
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,360
So I can get to the basic Bobby Hayton rant here.

343
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,360
This is Joe Newman in the background on Zug's Riffs album. Actually it's the Zug's band.

344
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,040
Uh, on a new Zug's Riffs album which we'll be playing a lot of. It's called Villagers.

345
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,740
This is an instrumental song called Villagers. Yes, the title song. I'm going to shut up and just...

346
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Let them go.

347
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,900
.

348
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,500
.

349
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,500


350
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,500


351
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
.

352
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,000


353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,100


354
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,540
Thank you.

355
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Thank you.

356
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
Thank you.

357
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
Thank you.

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,760
It's obvious, of course, the world in general is an idiot's delight.

359
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,540
A contrived mediocrity designed to keep morons occupied.

360
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,860
Just look at the notorious conspiracy media.

361
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,920
And not the decoy reputable media.

362
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,140
That's just a distraction.

363
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,700
Window dressing to make things look good.

364
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,460
I mean the stuff people really read and really believe whether they admit it or not.

365
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Look at the tabloids.

366
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,260
The true crime magazines.

367
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,280
The TV murder shows.

368
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,320
The two-inch thick metallic embossed covered hack sci-fi novels and romances.

369
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,100
Lame movie thrillers.

370
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,980
Manufactured music personalities.

371
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,160
It's bread and circuses with politicians as the clowns.

372
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,960
Except the more fun you want to have, the more you have to pay.

373
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,540
Don't act like you haven't thought about how bad all that stuff sucks.

374
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,060
You talk about it all the time.

375
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,980
The question is, what are you going to do about it?

376
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,680
They, the conspiracy, want you to buy all their crap.

377
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,720
Work hard all day at a mindless slave task.

378
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,080
To make, to pay for more machines.

379
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,140
To play their indoctrination programs on.

380
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,740
To fill your home with pseudo-collectibles in a limited number edition of a godzillion.

381
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,280
You know all that.

382
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,640
We've told you and told you all that.

383
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,280
And if you don't believe it by now, there's no hope for you at all.

384
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,320
And you might as well climb back over the fence and roll in the mud with the rest of the slavish porkers.

385
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,760
Right?

386
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,280
So you say to yourself, okay.

387
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,600
I know what the conspiracy wants from me.

388
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,260
I know how they work and what they do.

389
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,920
And I'm not...

390
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm not buying it.

391
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,700
By gabs, I'm not going to do what they tell me.

392
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,260
I'm throwing away my TV.

393
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,360
Smashing my porcelain thimble collection.

394
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,340
Frisbee-ing my CDs off Lover's Leap.

395
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,460
And joining the radical anti-government party to learn how to make bombs.

396
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm shaving my head and burning my house down.

397
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,540
And the more they tell me not to, the more I'll laugh in their faces and echo the noble sentiments of whoever it was that said,

398
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,240
Free at last, free at last, thank blob almighty, I'm free at last.

399
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,600
Right?

400
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,100
Sucker.

401
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
You think they didn't plan for that?

402
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,500
You think they'll be surprised huddling around their long mahogany table?

403
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,880
Appalled that one tenth of one percent of the population has quote, caught on, unquote,

404
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,480
and won't go up the slaughterhouse ramp like good little lambies?

405
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,500
Well, hardy har har.

406
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,540
Listen, they know they can't dupe everyone with the same bird brain programming system.

407
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,840
They know they're going to be a few.

408
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,540
You who are just sharp enough to shake themselves awake and look around to see the green pastures and still waters they were lying down by

409
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:36,540
are actually a clanking conveyor belt carrying them relentlessly toward the whirling blaze.

410
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,520
They had that worked out a long time ago.

411
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:48,620
They love it when the ones who see the horror of the conspiracy system go public with their ghastly revelations

412
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,960
or join radical anarchist communes or otherwise render themselves entirely unbelievable.

413
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:04,020
Who do you think invented hippies, punk rock, anarchism, youth gangs, graffiti art, rock and roll, hallucinogenic drugs,

414
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,720
the new age movement, Christianity, cult films, alternative what have you?

415
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:18,020
Sure, it was some lone radical disillusioned soul at first for about six months, but by the time we heard about it,

416
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,540
it was already a prepackaged official conspiracy product.

417
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh, but the church of the subgenius is different, right?

418
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:37,280
It's neither a conspiracy mediocrity brainwashing program nor a dead end escapee trap.

419
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:46,900
Bob isn't just a cheap product or just a mind numbing neurotic whip or a gaily painted prison cell of one sort or another

420
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,260
to confine drooling vidiots or raving reactionaries, right?

421
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,260
Right, right, right?

422
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,460
Huh!

423
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,380
Wrong again.

424
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:03,620
Look, why don't you just give up trying to think it all, little Miz and Mr. Einstein Jr. and pay attention.

425
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,000
The con has got all the bases covered.

426
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,560
It owns the ball and the ballpark.

427
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,300
Everything you can or will think or decide,

428
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,880
it has already got classified by you.

429
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,940
A numerical designation on big spinning spools of half inch magnetic tape.

430
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:30,720
You sitting here listening to this right now, thinking what you're thinking, wearing those clothes in that environment,

431
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,160
tasting that particular taste in your mouth and hearing that particular tinny whine in your ear,

432
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,440
the one you don't always notice but which is always there,

433
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,140
they got a number for it.

434
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,520
Believe me, they got it all.

435
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,760
Figured, dissected, classified and stuck in little boxes.

436
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,140
So what do I do, you may ask?

437
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,780
You can't win, you can't outsmart them.

438
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,140
You can't think or do anything that they haven't already decided you'll probably think or do.

439
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,220
You can't find a chink in their armor, not even Bob,

440
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
because he is just another part of it all.

441
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,700
So it's time to pack it in.

442
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:19,460
Just give up and shoot yourself in the head like you've been threatening to do just to get attention and sympathy.

443
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,260
But this time you really will do it.

444
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,200
And that too is just what they want you to do.

445
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,020
There really is no way out.

446
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,880
All that smash the conspiracy stuff is fun and amusing,

447
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:39,980
but putting your head under the machine's enormous clattering treads isn't gonna slow it one tiny bit.

448
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,800
It's utterly, utterly hopeless.

449
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
Just stop fighting it.

450
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,880
Give up.

451
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,120
You're only making things harder for everyone.

452
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,860
All that kicking and screaming is only disturbing the peaceful slumbers of the rest of us.

453
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,200
Oh, oh, I'm not saying you should simply get in line and walk under the hammer,

454
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,940
but if you can't do anything else,

455
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,460
you might as well try to see something positive about it.

456
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,160
Now sure, the conspiracy program is cruel and demeaning.

457
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,100
The cage is cramped and ugly and smells bad,

458
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,260
but you can't get out.

459
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,420
And if you did get out, you'd just want right back in again,

460
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,140
because the thing that is making the situation intolerable isn't in the situation.

461
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,880
It's in your head.

462
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:36,360
The scariest part of the conspiracy's lulling lies is that they're all true.

463
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,240
Oh, not the ones about the products.

464
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,540
And how bad you need them.

465
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,040
I mean the ones about how life can be beautiful.

466
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,020
It's easier to go with the flow.

467
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,600
Things are better than they've ever been.

468
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,540
They know how true those are.

469
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:55,300
So they do anything they can to make those true truths look stupid and childish.

470
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,980
They make Don't Worry, Be Happy into an insulting song.

471
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,700
Ugly t-shirts, plastic hats, moronic coffee mugs,

472
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,640
so when somebody says it to you, it makes you want to smash them in the face.

473
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,420
But you can't.

474
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,360
So you go buy a three dollar shot of bar of gin instead.

475
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,880
And worry miserably.

476
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,640
Oh, they make you want to kill Have a Nice Day,

477
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,820
and then sell you the t-shirt with a shot and bleeding smiley face on it.

478
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,380
They'll make you hate love and love hate,

479
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,980
mock sincerity and honesty, and sneer at genuine emotion.

480
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,220
Then they sell you a two hundred dollar leather jacket,

481
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,440
so you can prove you aren't a conspiracy zombie

482
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,700
like all those poor schmucks who don't have skulls on their t-shirts.

483
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,620
Or if you can't identify with either extreme of the haircut spectrum,

484
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,060
if they can't get you any other way,

485
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,500
if you're just a little too smart to be dumb and a little too dumb to be smart,

486
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,560
and you're just about to fall through the cracks,

487
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
along comes Bob.

488
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,400
And then you read all about those real weird things,

489
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,500
those weirdos who, even if they do wear uniforms and spout mottos,

490
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,680
wear intentionally self-mocking uniforms

491
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,080
and spout irrelevant, confusing, and meaningless mottos.

492
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,520
Ma'am!

493
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,480
At last, you can think to yourself,

494
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,160
or tell your uncomprehending friend,

495
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,020
at last there's a tiny spot in this big cold world

496
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,700
where I can feel at home.

497
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,640
At last, I've found a philosophy that agrees to a certain degree

498
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,400
with the one I never really knew I had.

499
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,860
At last, I can just be honest with myself

500
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,840
and be who I really am, publicly and unafraid.

501
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,360
So you send lots of money to Bob,

502
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,740
and buy t-shirts and buttons and tapes,

503
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,780
and put on a devival, have a radio show,

504
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,020
get a boy or girlfriend at last,

505
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,580
have the time of your life,

506
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,040
and never feel it.

507
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,020
But when the hammer finally does come down on your head...

508
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,660
Way to go.

509
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,920
It's not as if the time is over.

510
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:43,920


511
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,580
I am just in the middle of a jungle.

512
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:44,760
And this is what I'm actually doing,

513
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


514
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


515
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


516
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


517
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


518
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


519
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:44,760


520
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,920
I am the running dog.

521
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,420
I am a your dog.

522
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,640
You want me?

523
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,300
Well you like Uncle Duck's get the fuck out of here.

524
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,700
Until then y'all are going to be welcome to get your shit done,

525
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,180
at the first Bewalsckay sculpture doggos!

526
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,580
Ahh!

527
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,540
Thank you.

528
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,280
Thank you.

529
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,480
Thank you.

530
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,420
Thank you.

531
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Thank you.

532
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,580
Thank you.

533
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,960
Thank you.

534
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,460
Thank you.

535
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,240
Thank you.

536
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,620
Thank you.

537
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,820
Thank you.

538
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,580
Thank you.

539
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,500
Thank you.

540
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,100
Thank you.

541
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,480
Thank you.

542
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,040
Thank you.

543
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,420
Thank you.

544
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,260
Thank you.

545
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,860
Thank you.

546
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,480
to that cop, he's starting to smile.

547
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,140
And all this talk they're having about a drug war is just to keep your mind off the real

548
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,820
problem that's plaguing this nation, like the war on the people.

549
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,740
War on the people.

550
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,280
War on the people.

551
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,920
Drug war on the people.

552
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,400
War on the people.

553
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,960
Drug war on the people.

554
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,540
War on the people.

555
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,180
Church of the New Faith.

556
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,480
That's our first song we've ever heard from Church of the New Faith.

557
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Oh, sounds good.

558
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,280
Oh, Susan.

559
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,420
Let's take the time to talk a little bit about Connie.

560
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,020
Let's do this.

561
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,600
Connie Dobbs is kind of a new personage to the church.

562
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,300
She is Bob Dobbs' first and primary wife.

563
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,480
And since I found Connie, things are so different for me now.

564
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,800
And Connie is the most uber of uber women.

565
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,360
She is truly the higher price spread.

566
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,920
Connie doesn't need sex.

567
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,580
Sex needs Connie.

568
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,900
But it took Connie to let me know that I had slack.

569
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,580
One day I found Connie in my underwear drawer,

570
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,740
right under one of my black bustiers in the midst of stardust and cheap cologne.

571
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,360
And she said,

572
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,820
Floos, Floos, you need slack bad.

573
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,440
And she taught me how to take my slack and beat it against the wall

574
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,660
until the musk flowed to wring out every last precious drop of blessed slack.

575
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,680
And things like which marital aids,

576
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,600
which kids are truly top rack dishwasher safe.

577
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,480
And the honesty is the best policy, but insanity is a better defense.

578
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,460
I was sold and so was my soul.

579
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,000
I gladly signed Connie's contract in my own blood and I've never looked back.

580
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,980
The benefits were immediate.

581
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,680
I went on Connie's special slim fast ice cream fish stick diet, dropped 35 pounds.

582
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,920
And when my replacement driver's license came up,

583
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,900
the state had stamped under 21 on it in big red letters.

584
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,780
And I'm 36.

585
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,300
So if that isn't proof of an effective religious spiritual leader,

586
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,020
I don't know what is.

587
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,880
But yeah, to get a, to get a perception of Connie,

588
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,640
I guess it would be hard for the XY people,

589
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,620
the ones with the unfortunately mutated chromosome being an XX myself,

590
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,220
or actually I'm more closer to triple X.

591
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,020
I think I'll let a girl group called,

592
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,120
Mr. Rills from California say it for me.

593
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,720
.

594
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,340
.

595
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,320
.

596
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,400
.

597
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,600
. . Thank you for thinking back.

598
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:13,600


599
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:13,600


600
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:13,600


601
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:13,600


602
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,240
I hate men.

603
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:22,080
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I'm on the rag.

604
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,880
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I'm on the rag.

605
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,080
I'm swollen like a pig

606
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,020
Get me a pamperin'

607
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,320
My boobs hurt

608
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,340
I'm a rat

609
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,500
I'm a rat

610
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,420
Get me a contact

611
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,260
I'm a rat

612
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,020
I hate you

613
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,540
I hate me

614
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,880
I'm a rat

615
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
I'm a rat

616
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,900
I'm a rat

617
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,760
Get me a contact

618
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,480

I hate you

620
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,060
I hate me

621
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,260
I'm a rat

622
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,240
I'm a rat

623
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,440
I hate men

624
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,260
Don't even think of it tonight

625
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,960
Of course I'd be wearing white

626
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,720
I'm a rat

627
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,740
I'm a rat

628
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,600
Get me a contact

629
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,160
I'm a rat

630
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,180
I hate you

631
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,240
I hate me

632
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,140
I'm a rat

633
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,180
I'm a rat

634
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm a rat

635
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,940
I'm a rat

636
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:03,940


637
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,820
Get me a pamperin'

638
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,840
I'm a rat

639
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
I hate you

640
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,000
I hate me

641
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,560
I'm a rat

642
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,140
I'm a rat

643
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,500
I'm a rat

644
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:19,800
I'm a rat

645
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,000
Get me a pamperin'

646
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:23,420
I'm a rat

647
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:23,420


648
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm a rat

649
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,240


650
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,240


651
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,280
I wanna ride

652
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,120
I hate you

653
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,540
I hate me

654
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,100
I wanna ride

655
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,460
I wanna ride

656
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,900
Got me a touch of

657
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,420
I wanna ride

658
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,500
I hate you

659
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,920
I hate me

660
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,660
I wanna ride

661
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,960
I hate me

662
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,280
And I can go horseback riding and swimming and even put it in my sock.

663
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,640
Well, I bet you couldn't tell that was a girl group that did that one, huh?

664
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,900
It wasn't L7 either.

665
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,480
I heard that about three years ago. We were in LA.

666
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,400
We'd come up from the San Diego Comic Convention to hang out.

667
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,720
On Hollywood Freeway, coming into town,

668
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,740
a station that was kind of a pirate station,

669
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,620
91X out of Baja, California, Mexico, played that.

670
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,560
And somehow I learned the words real fast.

671
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,800
I was driving the rental car, my head sticking out the window and intoning those sacred words.

672
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,660
But I'm sure Connie feels the same way.

673
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:46,100
And looking around the vast amount of media influences that we have here in the church,

674
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,700
you can find all sorts of evidence.

675
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,540
Evidence of Connie.

676
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,540
One of my favorite Connie incarnations is

677
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,600
Taurus Satana and Faster Pussycat Kill Kill,

678
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,960
the immortal, mortal,

679
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,400
oh, I'm wearing a Freudian slip, too.

680
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,620
The immortal Russ Meyer movie from 1966.

681
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,800
And the Boss Tweeds did the theme song.

682
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,840
The Cramps, not the Cramps that the Thrillz have,

683
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,480
but the group The Cramps.

684
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,740
You may remember they did a cover of it.

685
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,300
So let's hear the theme from Faster Pussycat Kill Kill by the Bosses.

686
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,200
Say uptown.

687
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,980
Say downtown.

688
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,720
Don't go to layup.

689
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,140
Layup.

690
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,260
I just had to let it go.

691
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,600
Little nation of Serbia.

692
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,360
A singer.

693
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,380
A singer.

694
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,360
A singer.

695
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,940
This sound is what caused your alacrity,

696
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,880
your great humor and wit.

697
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,760
You're the fountainhead of your sputum.

698
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,160
Every morning is Halloween.

699
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,340
Every morning I get up and I put on that mask and I start scaring little kids.

700
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,300
And you go out there to life and you either get tricked or you get treated.

701
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,860
Yep, that's it.

702
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,480
It's one or the other, baby.

703
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,880
You trick and treat until you finally end up,

704
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,400
you won't be pretending to be a scary dead guy.

705
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,720
You really will be a scary dead guy.

706
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,820
I put little blisters between my legs and the fries in each eye.

707
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,920
There's two types of people in the world.

708
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,620
Those who like to get tricked, those who like to get treated, and those who can't count.

709
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,040
Oh, and the dead people.

710
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,360
Yeah, and those guys.

711
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,920
So that's four.

712
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,840
What about the living dead people?

713
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,300
Oh, I knew you were gonna come up with that.

714
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,060
The ones with the demons that speak from their navels.

715
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,940
Oh, hey, hey, it's patriotic time.

716
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,560
Yeah.

717
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,760
Okay, stand erect.

718
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,460
One nation, under-informed.

719
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,760
Get those shimmy knuckles off the floor, Sergeant.

720
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,500
I mean, private.

721
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,580
Spitzy.

722
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,540
I pledge allegiance to the pyramid scheme, and to the illusion for which it stands.

723
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,480
Private parts, put your hands back where they don't belong.

724
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,320
One nation in denial, with error and access by all.

725
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,360
Oh, boy.

726
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,700
Oh, boy.

727
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,860
Oh, boy.

728
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,040
Oh, boy.

729
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,100
Oh, boy.

730
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:01,860
Woo-hoo.

731
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,060
Bend over.

732
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,560
Uh, you know, I'm glad to hear...

733
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,940
Can you tell your radio audience to do that?

734
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,440
Yeah.

735
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,020
I pluck my lesions...

736
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,400
We can.

737
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,700
...in the fog...

738
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,560
In the fog...

739
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,140
...to a merry snake named America.

740
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,980
And to the respubics on which it stands, hairy and gold.

741
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,920
One nation, bright and shining like a stick.

742
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,600
Wow.

743
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,120
I'll run that up.

744
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,720
My flagpole.

745
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,200
Okay, Stang, it's your turn now.

746
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,260
What a flagpole.

747
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,660
Yeah, hey, yeah?

748
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,020
Huh?

749
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:34,920
Impressive, huh?

750
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,320
Come on, the music's speeding up.

751
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,220
Your pledge, your pledge, please.

752
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,680
This is my church.

753
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,300
There are others like it, but this one is mine.

754
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,560
I will sleep with this church.

755
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,920
I will rape with this church.

756
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,200
I will lock and load this church.

757
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,240
Praise God.

758
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,160
Hail Satan's stupid.

759
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,380
I could fight...

760
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,840
I, I, I, I...

761
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,400
...the young and white...

762
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,020
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

763
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,700
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

764
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,080
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

765
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,540
I know, I know, but you never know.

766
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,340
If captured, I will reveal nothing but my underwear.

767
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,960
I shall show my lesions privately and give only my name, rank, and serious numbers.

768
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,680
And then I shall be quiet again.

769
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,560
He got the right.

770
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,640
Rank part right.

771
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,980
What silver weaves...

772
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,540
I don't know. I don't know if that's gonna carry there in the heartland.

773
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,720
Now, we gotta shave, we gotta shave, we gotta shave.

774
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,000
We gotta make it smooth around the edges for it to carry in the heartland.

775
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,960
It's gotta have a lot of heart.

776
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,700
There's gotta be cows, there's gotta be oxen, there's gotta be, like, women, like, dressed like milkmaids.

777
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,760
There's gotta be them farmer guys.

778
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,480
There's gotta be a lot of guys with their muscles rolled up and their sleeves down.

779
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,260
We gotta, you know, the steel, the steel.

780
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,380
The rust of America.

781
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,880
Where's the sizzle?

782
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,240
Show me the sizzle.

783
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:45,720
There it is.

784
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,780
Oh, my God, there was...

785
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,440
Wow.

786
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,440
The face sizzled.

787
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:50,880
Sizzle.

788
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,140
And it's still flowing out from your chakras.

789
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,040
Relax now. Close your eye. That's right.

790
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,340
There's but a song we're singing.

791
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,960
Feels we were dying.

792
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,360
The San Francisco sound.

793
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,800
Yeah.

794
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,620
Yeah, yeah.

795
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,060
Yeah, it's just catching on out here in Ohio.

796
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
And the day of the flowers, I'm like...

797
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,080
Yeah, it's about sucking...

798
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,720
Oh, you can't say that on the radio.

799
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,180
No, this is golden time.

800
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,080
No, yeah, you can.

801
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,600
That's golden shower.

802
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,600
It's hell time.

803
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:19,980
Yeah.

804
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,940
Remember those songs by people with young and cold...

805
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,640
Come on, people, let's bomb together.

806
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,820
Let's all hold our knuckles.

807
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,600
We all gotta get together and bomb together.

808
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,940
We have to have a bomb circle.

809
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,080
Come on, let's hold our knuckles.

810
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,420
Let's have a bomb circle, yeah.

811
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,040
I'm bombing with you.

812
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,440
Let's turn to the north.

813
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,240
Praise the bombers from the north.

814
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,880
Praise the bombers from the north.

815
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,060
Praise the bombers from the north.

816
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,840
The bombers from the south, the east, the west.

817
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,060
Yes.

818
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,720
The four corners.

819
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,740
The bombers from the south are the napalmers.

820
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,900
The napalm bombers are the southern ones.

821
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,520
Let us salute the flak hackers of the west.

822
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,220
Let's...

823
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,520
Shall we salute...

824
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,100
Where can you get those opium bombs?

825
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,300
Those would go over really good at a party, you know?

826
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,480
Actually, that's not opium.

827
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,940
It's this synthetic stuff that's 100 billion times more powerful than opium.

828
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,640
Used exclusively by the Russian Defense Forces.

829
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,060
And it's catching on in the rave scene.

830
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,960
I think they were...

831
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,820
They had some at Burning...

832
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,120
Very popular in Chechnya now.

833
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

834
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,460
They just set off a bomb and people wander through the clouds.

835
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,460
Take a few hostages and sit down for a nap.

836
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,220
That's what the real...

837
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,080
That's what the flower children of 2002 are doing.

838
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:39,500
How many times were we buzz bombed by the black helicopters and yet could not conceal our pineal glands as they popped from our foreheads?

839
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,400
Detective Holmes?

840
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,500
Yeah?

841
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,420
So you just got back from Obscuristan, did you not?

842
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,160
Yeah, I was on special assignment in Obscuristan, yes.

843
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,120
Can you tell us anything about that?

844
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,880
Because all we've heard is the mainstream, you know, media about those...

845
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,580
Well, it's a very poor...

846
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:03,560
One of those poor ex-Soviet republics that's so poor that a big wind came along and blew all the cops out off and now they gotta import sand.

847
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,300
They're the only desert nation that can import sand now.

848
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,560
And so we're trying to help them out.

849
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,580
And so we're having a sand drive.

850
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,560
A sand drive?

851
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:20,020
And so if you could go out into your neighborhoods and go to the sand boxes and kitty litter boxes around the neighborhood and then collect that and then send it in.

852
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,160
And here's the address, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

853
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,800
Wait a minute, what are you telling people to send?

854
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,360
Sand. This is to help the...

855
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,100
Sand. The poor people in Obscuristan, they've lost their sand.

856
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:33,880
Oh.

857
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,860
And you know, we promised them $9 billion worth of sand and they still have not collected a single drop of sand.

858
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:47,940
Well, you know, 100,000 people marched on Washington last weekend and you hardly heard anything about it and nobody really...

859
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,500
Nobody told me about it, dude.

860
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,000
100,000 people.

861
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:51,640
I heard somebody pulled...

862
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,640
I heard somebody pulled Trent Locke's pubic goatee at the Eastwood funeral.

863
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,000
What?

864
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I mean, at the funeral for Senator Locke...

865
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
See www.subgenius.com

866
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,900
The way it goes.

867
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,700
In church, well, not too many, shea, but certainly many.

868
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,400
In fact, most women in Protestant churches don't...

869
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,320
do not wear hats.

870
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:19,180
And for several weeks thereafter, there was a long period of time when it seemed, although it was not so, it seemed...

871
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,500
Customary became a friend of these particular people.

872
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,660
If it was harmful, I'd be the first one to admit it and tell you that, but I don't see anything wrong.

873
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,820
I don't think...

874
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,440
Oh.

875
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,640
Back to that.

876
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,180
Impani, she was the...

877
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,360
0034.

878
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,060
That it would not work and would not...

879
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,420
And it's not going to be true.

880
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,680
Well, it's going to be hard because a lot of these programs have been saved or have been modified.

881
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,840
0035.

882
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,600
0036.

883
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000


884
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,940
0038.

885
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,000
0040.

886
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,520
0041.

887
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:57,520


888
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,240
0043.

889
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,240


890
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,240
0045.

891
00:56:59,780 --> 00:56:59,780


892
00:56:59,780 --> 00:56:59,780


893
00:56:59,780 --> 00:56:59,780


894
00:56:59,780 --> 00:56:59,780


895
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,260
0050.

896
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,300
0050.

897
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,340
0051.

898
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:03,480


899
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:03,480


900
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:03,480


901
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:03,880
0055.

902
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,860
0056.

903
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,340


904
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,140
0058.

905
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,980
0059.

906
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,780
0060.

907
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:22,780


908
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:22,820
0062.

909
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:22,820


910
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,500
0065.

911
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,080
0067.

912
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


913
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


914
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


915
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


916
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


917
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


918
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,880
001, 002, 001...

919
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:28,880


920
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,720
0013, 0024...

921
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


922
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


923
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,540
0025...

924
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:31,540


925
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:31,920
0027.

926
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:31,960


927
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:31,980


928
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,340
0030.

929
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:33,720
0031.

930
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,000
0033.

931
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,180
0034.

932
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,060
If Bob dies, we will alert you.

933
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,560
Yeah!

934
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,820
That guy scared me.

935
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,460
I'd like to put out a request for the caller that thinks that

936
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,340
Philo is the greatest show person that's ever been on the show.

937
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,800
Well, perhaps that caller is attempting to contact us now.

938
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,860
Let's find out here.

939
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,120
I want to talk to that guy.

940
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,160
I think he moved.

941
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,180
Hello, you're on the air.

942
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,320
Yes, I've been looking, looking, looking for Simon.

943
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,520
Well, what about Dr. Philo Drummond?

944
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,680
Do you have a question for him?

945
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,700
Oh, no, I didn't.

946
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,180
All right, ditch this loser.

947
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,580
There's a band hanging from the side of their face.

948
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,940
Well, so much for the callers at 848-4425.

949
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,560
Now one wildly insulted person is jumping up and down in front of the station

950
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,420
with a shotgun ready to off the famous subgenius radio personality.

951
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,640
Don't ever take me alive.

952
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,840
Don't ever get me.

953
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,860
You'll have to.

954
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,160
You'll have to.

955
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,400
You'll have to pry the show out of your cold pink hands.

956
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,920
Sinbad has his prostate examined.

957
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,140
See men poke sticks at monsters.

958
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,300
See them battle the million skeletons.

959
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,600
All old, all dead before.

960
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,940
And don't miss appalling co-hit, The Big Monster.

961
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,080
Nothing could stop it except dynamite.

962
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,000
And with our new virtual unreality imaging system,

963
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,920
you too can have sex with Bart Simpson.

964
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,760
Play some Hypergeeks records.

965
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,060
I want to hear Jane or Hypergeeks.

966
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,060
I want to hear the Will of the Bale.

967
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,880
I want to hear the number of the meme meme meme meme.

968
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,580
I want to eat dick.

969
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,300
I want to eat dick.

970
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,080
I want to eat dick.

971
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,560
I want to eat dick.

972
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:12,720
I want to eat dick.

973
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,060
I was talking to John Holmes the other day and I said,

974
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,760
is that your penis or a post-old digger?

975
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,680
But seriously, no.

976
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,800
You know when they...

977
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,360
That was dedicated to Doug Smith on his show.

978
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,460
Poor Will of the Dobbs got nailed for saying that very thing.

979
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,720
Hey, you know I was talking...

980
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,020
I don't know how to top that except by saying you're listening to radio station

981
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,320
throw rope side ears.

982
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,460
You know, 90 to no one ate the voice of the people.
