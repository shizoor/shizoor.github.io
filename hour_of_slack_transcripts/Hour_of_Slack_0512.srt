1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Crash! Down! Destroy!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Crash! Down! Destroy!

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,220
Destroy!

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,880
Show...

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,860
Good...

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,440
Unsheath the sword.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,260
Praise Bob.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,740
Call forth the death squad.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,720
Let loose the dogs.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,860
Show...

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,040
Good...

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,060
Make Bob your god.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,840
Blasphemy...

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,200
Scream the name.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,660
Stretch forth...

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,280
thy rod.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,680
Get on...

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
your knees.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,860
Make me...

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,940
your god.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,920
You are about to...

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,120
experience the awe...

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,420
and mystery...

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,680
which reaches from the inner...

25
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,020
mind to...

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,140
the subgenius...

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,580
Power of...

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,280
SWAT!

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,940
Welcome potential initiates...

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,880
and remain with us for the next...

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,560
30 minutes.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,400
Gosh!

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,480
Unbelievable!

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,300
It's a giant...

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,380
electric... thing.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,780
It eats its way through the earth like a...

37
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,420
huge mole.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,640
There it goes!

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,960
Uh, yeah, okay, I'm not... wait a minute.

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,700
What was it, honey?

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,960
What are we going to do about this dreaded scourge?

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,400
This show... this horrible...

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,960
This looks like a job for Komode Fran.

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,360
From the Komodo Islands.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Komode Fran will save the show.

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,300
Little Komode Fran.

47
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,300
Good god, what's that? The ground is shaking.

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,040
That's the show.

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,400
Komode Fran!

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,040
Little Komode Fran.

51
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,880
Cutting through the Scleegers.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,680
Throat smack.

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,380
Throat smack?

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,780
Yes, they gave him a throat smack because he refused...

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,860
to participate in the golfer decapitation...

56
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,600
ceremony here at Doc Stock 73.

57
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,440
The judge said...

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,480
it was justified homicide.

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,440
Yeah!

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,700
It was just a...

61
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,580
pied homicide.

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,840
It was just a hat that they...

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
burned on his homicide.

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,040
Which side...

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,480
was that?

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,560
That's the side that does the blind date show...

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,220
Oh, that's the third.

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,480
Listen, Es...

69
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,700
Yep, we're almost here.

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,460
Pug Girl and Weather Man get together.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But whether this ever happens...

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
only Dobbs knows.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,700
The Churl...

74
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
would never miss out on this incredible date.

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,580
He's an unprincipled churl, this Bob Dobbs...

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Friends...

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,040
I had a revelation...

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
last night...

79
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,060
Right before...

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,980
the World Series number one...

81
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,860
I went to a movie...

82
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,860
The movie sucked.

83
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,880
My wallet...

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,040
was gone.

85
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes, friends...

86
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,920
when I came from the movie theater...

87
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,000
I lifted up my purse and I noticed...

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,880
it was a little bit lighter...

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,920
than when I walked in.

90
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,780
Unbeknownst to me...

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,840
Bob had reached into...

92
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,620
my life again.

93
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
And he had taken...

94
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,420
my credit cards.

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,160
He had taken my cash.

96
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,980
He had taken...

97
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,700
my Ohio driver's license.

98
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,620
Praise Bob!

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,540
Maybe.

100
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,820
Cause when I went home, friends...

101
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,960
after the movie...

102
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,040
when I called up my credit card friends...

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
and I said, friends...

104
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,040
my wallet is gone.

105
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,020
They said, Bob...

106
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
ran up a $755...

107
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,380
dollar bill...

108
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,740
in the space of two and a half hours.

109
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,160
Crazy!

110
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,940
I thought that was professional...

111
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,420
material.

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,420
But it really had been Bob.

113
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,020
Nonetheless...

114
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,640
I've canceled my credit cards.

115
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,260
I have no wallet.

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,680
I have no money.

117
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,860
But I do have my faith...

118
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,960
in Bob.

119
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,840
And so, friends...

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,380
I will sing to you a song...

121
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,780
that I would hope you would join along with me.

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,740
Sing it, Sister Maloney!

123
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,880
It's a song called...

124
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,960
My Wallet Belongs to Bob.

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,820
My Wallet Belongs to Bob.

126
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,240
My Wallet Belongs to Bob.

127
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,920
My Wallet Belongs to Bob.

128
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,920


129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,920


130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,940
Well I used...

131
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,200
to be a sinner...

132
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
cause I truly did believe...

133
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,020
that the Virgin Mary, Jesus...

134
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,500
and me were thick...

135
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,120
as thieves.

136
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,620
And I used to give my dough...

137
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,220
to televangelistic snobs.

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,820
But then the light had shone upon me...

139
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,900
and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs.

140
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
And now my wallet...

141
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,560
belongs to Bob.

142
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

143
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,420
Well, my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job.

144
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,940
My wallet belongs to Bob.

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,960
Well, Bobby goes a-froppin' every chance that he can get.

146
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,640
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,180
So I gave him all my money.

148
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,540
Reverend Stang said it was right.

149
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,040
And for only $20, actually it was about $30 or $40 or maybe even $50,

150
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,380
he did save my soul tonight.

151
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,100
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,940
No more can the kids say,

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,780
it's a conspiracy my lowly wages rob.

155
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,200
My wallet belongs to Bob.

156
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,460
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie and Connie is her name.

157
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,320
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

158
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,020
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard.

159
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,880
And pulls her hand out holding on to her mighty credit card.

160
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,440
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.

161
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

162
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,120
And I never have to fear, cause I know Connie's on the job.

163
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,680
My wallet belongs to Bob.

164
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,920
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too.

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,420
Their existential energy may be what's right for you.

166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,640
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults.

167
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,800
Give away your money to the one that gets results.

168
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
And then your money will be for Bob.

169
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,540
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

170
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,660
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob.

171
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,040
And your wallet will be for Bob.

172
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,280
Well, I admit it, and much calmer got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

173
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,900
sitting on the dashboard of my car.

174
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,740
Pray.

175
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Pray.

176
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,080
Pray.

177
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,700
Praise Bob.

178
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,260
Oh, praise Bob.

179
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,580
Praise Bob.

180
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, praise Sister Melodious Chops there.

181
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,820
Well, finally, we got a decent recording, live recording of that song

182
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,700
by Sister Melodious Chops.

183
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,620
And she went and flubbed one of the last lines on it.

184
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,700
But, you know,

185
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,080
that's the way of this mighty church, I guess.

186
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,640
Let's see.

187
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay.

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
This mighty church, yes.

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,620
This one true religion, the one that was put here for you and you alone, yes.

190
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:07,060
Only you qualify for the, for membership in the church of the subgenius.

191
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,680
With this record, I have provided you with a record.

192
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,200
With the weapon.

193
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,740
For the love of God, get a copy of it into every American home.

194
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,700
The Xerox 5090 Duplicate.

195
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,820
Powerful, state-of-the-art machine.

196
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,220
Powerful copies are on the way.

197
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,440
.

198
00:09:36,440 --> 00:10:06,440


199
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:36,440


200
00:10:36,440 --> 00:11:06,440


201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:36,440


202
00:11:36,440 --> 00:12:06,440


203
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:36,440


204
00:12:36,440 --> 00:13:06,440


205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:36,440


206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:14:06,440


207
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:36,440


208
00:14:36,440 --> 00:15:06,440


209
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:36,440


210
00:15:36,440 --> 00:16:06,440


211
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:36,440


212
00:16:36,440 --> 00:17:06,440


213
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:36,440


214
00:17:36,440 --> 00:18:06,440


215
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:36,440


216
00:18:36,440 --> 00:19:06,440


217
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:36,440


218
00:19:36,440 --> 00:20:06,440


219
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:36,440


220
00:20:36,440 --> 00:21:06,440


221
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,700
I'll give you a note for your boss.

222
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,460
It'll prove sins.

223
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,840
I would like to be Pope Reverend Citizen Stoli.

224
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:13,980
Sure.

225
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,720
Can I be that?

226
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,200
Sure, for that, when that...

227
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
I've got the 30 bucks, right here.

228
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,540
All right.

229
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,920
The moment of truth.

230
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm passing.

231
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,040
The passing of the green.

232
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,000
Let me hold these dollar bills up against my third nostril.

233
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,640
Okay.

234
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,560
And we'll whiff-read the psychic stench.

235
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Yes, yes, he is a true subgenius.

236
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
He is a child of the Yeti.

237
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah.

238
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,780
I detect the, the auraic stench, that particular stench.

239
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,760
Um, I, by the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs, uh, Xulu, Quar, and, uh, Connie

240
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,160
Dobbs, and Hercules, I, uh, you may now do anything you want for the rest of your life.

241
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,140
Praise Dobbs.

242
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,900
Praise Bob.

243
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Cool.

244
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,480
Stoli, Reverend, what is it again?

245
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
Liberated from that which has enslaved him.

246
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,460
Oh, you're Pope Reverend Citizen Stoli.

247
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Wow.

248
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
Pope Reverend Citizen Stoli.

249
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,260
All right, got it.

250
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,220
I've passed the money over.

251
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,260
You're official now, man.

252
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,740
Yeah, man.

253
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,600
But what you need to do now is run out and buy the last New Testament.

254
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:03,760
Oh, yeah.

255
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:03,760


256
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:03,760


257
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:03,860
The New Testament.

258
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,140
Okay.

259
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,400
Uh, Revelation X, that's the new, for people who loved the book of the subgenius,

260
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,780
uh, you know, that was like the Old Testament.

261
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,880
Now we have the new one.

262
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,460
Oh, okay.

263
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,900
Uh, not to be confused with Generation X or any other X-oriented things.

264
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,800
X, okay.

265
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Revelation.

266
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,800
This, this relates to X-Day, the end of the world on July 5th, 1998.

267
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,780
Okay.

268
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,560
Coming up about two and a half years from now.

269
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Very cool.

270
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm, I'm prepared.

271
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm gonna bone up.

272
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,700
I'm gonna, I'm gonna be the word of Bob.

273
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,780
I'm gonna, I'm gonna be the word of Bob.

274
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,780
Be, be the word.

275
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,840
Let Bob speak through you.

276
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,060
Yes.

277
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,100
Actually, if you let Bob speak through you, you can only get a, you can only channel about

278
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,860
one word at a time before your head burns out like an old flash cube.

279
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,500
We have to go through a heck of a lot of slaves and followers just to get a few sentences

280
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,940
for this book.

281
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,900
Well, maybe I'll just hold off on that until I feel as though I'm a little bit more

282
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,380
powerful.

283
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,900
Oh, you should feel more powerful already.

284
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,500
Yeah.

285
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,340
How do you feel, man?

286
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,340
You've just been ordained.

287
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,740
Oh, I feel, uh, literally electric.

288
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,820
Good.

289
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,100
But yet, just a little bit lazy.

290
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,340
Am I gonna get a receipt for this?

291
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,080
Um.

292
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,820
I'm just asking.

293
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,900
What are you trying to write this off?

294
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,380
I don't know.

295
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,420
I just, I, I, I, you know, I, I just gave up 30 bucks to see Stoli become a minister.

296
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,920
I just, you know.

297
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,060
Wasn't it worth your 30 bucks?

298
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,140
It felt good at the time.

299
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,420
All right.

300
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,020
What I really feel like doing right now is sitting on a big couch and eating peanut butter

301
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,360
right out of the, right out of the jar.

302
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,240
Whoa.

303
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,320
You, you have, you have that, that right.

304
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:21,960
Okay.

305
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Now, of course, we can't guarantee that the conspiracy won't fire you for doing that.

306
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,120
Oh, really?

307
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,500
Is that against the rules?

308
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,720
Well, uh, it depends on which rules.

309
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,300
Well, there are no rules.

310
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:30,720
No.

311
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,520
There's only one rule in the Church of the Subgenius, and I have to paraphrase it completely

312
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,940
for radio, but to put it politely, if they canst not take a joke, let them mount up upon

313
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,560
themselves.

314
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,600
Yes.

315
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,560
Mount up upon themselves.

316
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,900
That's a nice way of saying it there, uh, Reverend.

317
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,800
I can live by that.

318
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,180
I can live, I can live completely by that law.

319
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,680
I got no problem.

320
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,480
And we will be watching them mount up upon themselves tonight at the, the gigantic

321
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,020
GWAR Massacre.

322
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,380
Praise Bob.

323
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,960
I got into bad jokes there.

324
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,660
All right.

325
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,380
Praise Bob.

326
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,000
We want to thank both of you guys for coming in.

327
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,920
Absolutely.

328
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
Reverend Stang and, uh, the Sexecutioner from GWAR.

329
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,780
Lord Sexecutioner.

330
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,360
I thank you, and, uh, Pope Reverend Stoli, uh, Citizen Stoli.

331
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,880
Citizen Stoli.

332
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,140
Sorry.

333
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,240
Pope Reverend Citizen Stoli.

334
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,420
Thank you.

335
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,920
And Brooke.

336
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes, thank you.

337
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,380
We're just normal citizens.

338
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,540
Yeah, and I'm, you know, get Revelation X, man, the New Testament.

339
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,240
I gotta check it out.

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,340
Thanks a lot for coming in, guys.

341
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,020
Praise Bob.

342
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,800
Happy Halloween.

343
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,320
See you later.

344
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,120
All right.

345
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,380
We have traffic and weather next.

346
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:52,920

A Skype server from Google Home.

Gentlemen, boys and girls, River and Ivan Stang is on the phone with us tonight.

352
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,740
Stuck somewhere.

353
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Oh, listen, man, there's three mafia... Can you hear me?

354
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:10,820
Yeah.

355
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,220
Okay, now, assuming we're not on the air or anything, there's three mafia guys outside the door.

356
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,240
Yeah, wait, let me get that on tape again.

357
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,280
Business.

358
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,020
Man?

359
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,540
Hello?

360
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,480
Yeah, man, we're here.

361
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,700
We ain't going anywhere.

362
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,160
I mean, the preaching business was a dirty...

363
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,040
was always kind of a dirty business.

364
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,960
But, God, jeez, the music business.

365
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,840
Commercial music business?

366
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,440
Yeah.

367
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,120
These guar guys are afraid that we're going to undersell them.

368
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,540
And they sent some sort of...

369
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,300
They're like mafia tough guys that are supposed to follow us around.

370
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,740
Yeah.

371
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,740
And the other thing is...

372
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Okay, we're not on the air or anything, right?

373
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:01,960
No.

374
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,900
I think they're...

375
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,360
I don't think that those are rubber suits.

376
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,860
That they're wearing?

377
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,960
Yeah, I know that sounds ridiculous, but I don't think that...

378
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,320
That band, guar...

379
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,840
Yeah.

380
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,760
I don't think that...

381
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,120
I mean, part of it, of course, is costumes, but I...

382
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,280
There's a lot of...

383
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,420
I think they...

384
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,360
I think they really are that way.

385
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,960
Yeah.

386
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,120
Yeah.

387
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,740
Yeah.

388
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,420
Yeah.

389
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


390
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


391
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


392
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


393
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


394
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


395
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


396
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


397
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


398
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


399
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


400
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


401
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


402
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


403
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


404
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


405
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


406
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,420


407
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,320
Did you ever wonder why they...

408
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,080
I knew that ghost was Lagoon.

409
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,620
I knew that.

410
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,240
Did you ever want to know why you want to figure...

411
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
Well, that probably was obvious to lots of people.

412
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,180
The priest with the baseball bat.

413
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,220
Were you there when that happened?

414
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,720
I actually missed the moment of truth.

415
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,260
Like, yeah, like, Dr. Katahdin Lagoon,

416
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,600
materialized in the flesh,

417
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,580
risen from the dead,

418
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,380
just like Jesus,

419
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,480
just like the Son of God.

420
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,680
Dr. Lagoon rose from the dead.

421
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,640
And, I mean, we had...

422
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,680
We had wept over him.

423
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,580
We had done...

424
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,340
I mean, this guy had been dead for a month.

425
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,400
I urinated on his body myself.

426
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:14,880
Age.

427
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,280
And, boy, were a lot of people mad.

428
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,780
You know, they'd spent money on the funeral arrangements

429
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,560
and having him embalmed and everything.

430
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,560
And here he was prancing around with his baseball bat.

431
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,120
Well...

432
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,120
About three blocks down the street,

433
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,860
I walked out.

434
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,860
I was so nonplussed by watching him walk back up on stage.

435
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,920
He can't hear you.

436
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
I think you've got to come sit over here.

437
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,580
He can't hear you.

438
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,620
I can hear the old sailor.

439
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,760
I can hear the old sailor in the background.

440
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,880
Can you hear the old sailor crying in his mud?

441
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,540
Yeah, there he is.

442
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,220
Poor old peg-legged...

443
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,460
One-eyed juiceberry Frank.

444
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,040
...plopping around on deck.

445
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,820
But you said the Gwarza's not in the rubber suits.

446
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,220
No, I don't think they are rubber.

447
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,500
I mean, part of it's a suit.

448
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,840
The spikes and things and the bear traps and the chainsaws are props.

449
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,600
But their skin...

450
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,840
Their faces are really like that.

451
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,920
Well, I thought you said them three goons which was sent around to follow you

452
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,360
was wearing big rubber suits and maybe that's all it is.

453
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, no, the mafia guys are...

454
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,180
You know, they look like mafia guys in a movie or something.

455
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,280
Oh, that's the rubber suits?

456
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,600
Oh, no, no, those aren't the rubber suits.

457
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,840
No, those guys are in rubber suits, too.

458
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm trying to tell you something.

459
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,220
You think I'm misunderstanding.

460
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,220
Oh, you mean the ones that look normal are the ones in the rubber suits?

461
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,900
Yes, and actually those are like very, very skinny bobbies are in those suits.

462
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,400
You think some made men are coming around looking for you guys

463
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,280
because of the Gwar thing and stuff

464
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,500
and because of the penitential results of the annual...

465
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,340
The annual...

466
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,660
The tour you're going to be on.

467
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,240
But there's some weird conspiracy of like three or...

468
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,100
300...

469
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,180
It's scribbled here pretty weird

470
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,620
and they said they're going to go out in rubber suits

471
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,460
like these weird pinstripe things looking like John Gotti and stuff.

472
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,820
Yeah, it was like that.

473
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,060
Oh, I guess it wasn't...

474
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,960
But we can't pay them off.

475
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,660
That's the thing.

476
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,200
Devil Aqua doesn't have the money.

477
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,060
Bobco right now is like insolvent

478
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,220
because of the phases of the moon or some ridiculous thing.

479
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,780
It's like Connie Dobbs gets this advice from an astrologer now.

480
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,220
Yeah, but she...

481
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,160
It's out of the picture.

482
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,620
And the mob has moved in.

483
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,620
It's like we were just playing games with...

484
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,560
Oh, we'd kill a preacher here or a hyena popped there.

485
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,060
Yeah, some of the hyenas got popped by the same time.

486
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,940
Guys are like going,

487
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,720
you don't play that game without our permission.

488
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,860
No, not with...

489
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,400
And we own the contract between both bands.

490
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,740
Yeah, especially with the transdigular arrangement

491
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,100
you both got last week.

492
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,160
Somebody said that his head turned into a whole mountainous

493
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,460
huge amount of cabbage and stuff

494
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,040
and was mowed off by a power mower in the middle of it.

495
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,760
Sorry.

496
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,300
No, no, that was one of your dreams.

497
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,660
One of your dreams.

498
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,240
Like the dream of the tape running out.

499
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,360
Listen to that.

500
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes, but the fact is, dear friends,

501
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,000
that really neither preaching nor comedy

502
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,220
have traditionally seemed mixed well with rock and roll concerts.

503
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,900
Not even...

504
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,740
Subgenius preaching with elaborate video backdrops

505
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,720
and taped Doctors for Bob music

506
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,160
and lots of props like flying swords

507
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,560
and bleeding heads that talk

508
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,360
and buckets, whole buckets of pills.

509
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,720
Nope, it don't work.

510
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,000
Not even at a GWAR concert.

511
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,720
Now see, there's this band called GWAR

512
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,540
that we went on tour with, sort of.

513
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,780
Meant to do nine cities,

514
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,920
dropped out after five with no hard feelings.

515
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,980
Um, because the thrash speed metal audience

516
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,400
with, you know, the kids with the rings in their noses

517
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,000
and the highly individualated tattoos and so on.

518
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,620
Well, they were too pink, lame, cowardly, and herd-like

519
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,400
to deal with the word of Bob.

520
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,140
Even, even, friends, the audience of GWAR,

521
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,260
which would surprise you if you knew

522
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,140
what masters of huldada are, in fact, those GWAR beings.

523
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,400
And if you're only passingly familiar,

524
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,080
you're familiar with them, uh, with GWAR,

525
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,800
they seem like just another speed metal band

526
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,420
except that they wear rubber monster suits

527
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,840
and are known for onstage fake disembowelings

528
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,940
and abortions in which fake blood, sperm, and urine

529
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,660
are sprayed all over the teenage audience

530
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,480
of pudgy 15-year-old boys.

531
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,180
But, my friends, if you are in discernment,

532
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,240
if you are truly in the spirit,

533
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,840
you would recognize that GWAR is actually

534
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,580
a vastly unappreciated satire band.

535
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,060
And a pretty proficient one, too.

536
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,400
I mean, they're not entirely divorced

537
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,680
from the beloved approaches of, yes, Devo,

538
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,320
yes, Frank Zappa, yes, Mojo Nixon, et al.,

539
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,640
and the Church of the Subgenius.

540
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,740
And they're almost as blasphemous as Doctors for Bob.

541
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,820
Oh, friends, I could go on and on

542
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,160
about the sights I witnessed in their shows

543
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,760
and the incredibly nervy, anti-conspiracy rudeness

544
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,140
in which they indulge onstage, and maybe I will.

545
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,380
And, in fact, I do on the Subgenius website,

546
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,040
but this is only a one-hour show,

547
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,420
so let it suffice to say

548
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,500
that maybe you ought to catch their act in any way you can.

557
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Friends, you ever been to an Aguar concert?

558
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,460
Well, they are kind of like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on acid.

559
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,520
Real good acid, a lot of it.

560
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Kind of like the Power Rangers, but X-rated and totally, totally satanic.

561
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,420
Like a Robert Williams painting brought to life, dear friends.

562
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,660
Plus, they have this great-looking, evil, naked girl dancer that breathes fire

563
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,520
and a 19-foot-tall robot monster on stage.

564
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,660
And in the first five minutes of their Ragnarok End of the World tour,

565
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,860
they decapitate O.J. Simpson and disembowel the resurrected corpse of Jerry Garcia.

566
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,580
Plus, the lead singer gets abducted by aliens and the naked dancer babe gets an abortion

567
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,680
while crucified of her mutant baby,

568
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,720
which baby then bites off the face of the subgenius of the band,

569
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,640
the sadistic, sophisticated Arabian Niner.

570
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,020
And the night's S&M genie called the Sexecutioner.

571
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,220
Friends, it's a hell of a show. It really is.

572
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,940
And I think during this song is when they're fighting Cardinal Sin.

573
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Yes, the rubber monster-suited hideous.

574
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,640
And the...

575
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,500
The thing is, friends, I don't think that those are fake rubber suits.

576
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,360
And I don't think it's all fake blood.

577
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,160
Friends, these masters of Bulldada deserve an audience, shall we say,

578
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,380
a bit more appreciative of their artistry

579
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,360
than can be those slope-headed throwback metalheads

580
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,540
who don't even know when they're being insulted and satirized by the heroes.

581
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,440
An audience like, say, the subgeniuses

582
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,040
who can see visions in comic books and wine bottles.

583
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,180
Yes, friends.

584
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,600
Yes, friends.

585
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,300
It is time that the church throw its full weight behind

586
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,620
and alongside that of noir,

587
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,840
those lowbrow, disgusting,

588
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,200
completely, utterly un-PC,

589
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,000
mostly must-be-censored-to-play-on-the-radio

590
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,880
top of cool rock and roll party band.

¶¶

614
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,820
I've never been so jealous in my life, honest.

615
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,980
I watched GWAR five nights in a row through a black-and-white handycam viewfinder,

616
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:01,320
and, oh, it was, I just thought to myself, what a fun job that looks like to me.

617
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,620
But I know that you probably want to hear me talk about the drugs and the groupies,

618
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,240
and, yes, they were far, far better than I ever would have imagined.

619
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,520
It was almost as if they must have been completely imaginary, friends.

620
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,120
It was cooler than being Led Zeppelin.

621
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,880
It was cool more along the lines of Spinal Tap.

622
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,140
That's how it really was.

623
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,540
And, by the way, everything that we've been describing on these shows,

624
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,120
the GWAR tour, the GWAR show, the legume death life rituals,

625
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,540
are reported upon in greatly fictionalized detail

626
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,220
with fun and entertainment.

627
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,560
You can find photos on the Subgenius website at sunsight.unk.edu slash subgenius.

628
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,140
We'll give that address again and our P.O. box and everything else.

629
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,200
Although, you know, half of you are still like my grandpa was about TV,

630
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,020
saying, well, I ain't going to get connected to that Internet

631
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,160
and fall for that conspiracy distraction.

632
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,660
I got all the information I need already from all these punk fanzines

633
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,420
published by, well,

634
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,680
they are published by Time Warner now.

635
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,960
Well, it is true that all radio, TV, and publishing

636
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,220
are now controlled by three huge right-wing companies,

637
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,480
but that Internet stuff,

638
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,260
that's nothing but child porno and viruses and dumb chat lines,

639
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,800
just like the newspaper said.

640
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,800
I ain't going to fall for that conspiracy trick.

641
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,220
Anyway, friends, that Subgenius,

642
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,940
this worldwide website address for those so gullible

643
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,000
as to fall for the conspiracy trick of a totally free-to-anybody,

644
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,160
5,000-page Subgenius magazine in full color

645
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,280
with the uncensored versions of this show

646
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
and everything else we ever did,

647
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,560
that web address is

648
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,340
http,

649
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,380
see, it always has the P in it,

650
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,080
slash slash,

651
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,900
that's http colon slash slash

652
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,420
sunsight,

653
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,380
S-U-N-S-I-T-E period,

654
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,200
S-U-N-S-I-T-E period,

655
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,200


656
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,200


657
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,200


658
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,200


659
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,340
E-D-U,

660
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,220
Sunsight Unc-Ed-U,

661
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,720
slash,

662
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,580
Subgenius.

663
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,220
And friends,

664
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,640
Subgenius does not have an O in it.

665
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,180
I say that for the benefit of many subgeniuses out there.

666
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,780
And if you can only afford a cheap computer,

667
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,500
the news group called Alt.Slack is just as good,

668
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,040
but in a more interactive way.

669
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,940
Sorry to be so vehement about all this,

670
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,840
but while this church of the subgenius is regarded,

671
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,940
as but a pathetic footnote in the so-called real world,

672
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,340
at least until 1998, that, friends,

673
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,120
on the internet, on the other hand,

674
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,820
the church is famous, respected,

675
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,740
totally uncensored, and financially supported.

676
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,880
The internet is the first medium I've ever dealt with

677
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,100
where it isn't who you know, but what you know.

678
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,980
But, oh, you're probably not interested in that.

679
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,620
No, you probably hate computers

680
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,880
and all those complicated instructions like

681
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,360
on, off, connect to, and disconnect.

682
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,920
No, no.

683
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,080
No, no.

684
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,160
No, no.

685
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,700
You're too organic for all that complicated dweeb stuff.

686
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,820
Ah, shut up.

687
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,240
Now, let's get back to this.

688
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,140
Guar versus the church.

689
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,300
We ain't gonna be taking any crap from Guar.

690
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,780
I don't care if they're eight feet,

691
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,300
if they are eight feet tall and got monster faces.

692
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,820
But still, it was kind of cool.

693
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,820
Even though their audiences sort of,

694
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,600
well, they really hated us the first night.

695
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,640
I had to change.

696
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,040
I had to change the,

697
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,720
I had to change the preaching style.

698
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,800
I'll try to give you a little sampling

699
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,040
of just how low I had to prostitute the word of Bob

700
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,000
in order to get these stupid,

701
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,400
I mean, they weren't stupid enough to be subgeniuses, man.

702
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,500
I mean, we're talking bad, bad.

703
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,780
But let's see if we can find,

704
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,880
I had to cuss a lot for one thing.

705
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,040
And so we may have to save this for the X-rated show

706
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,380
that you can't hear.

707
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,180
Thank you.

708
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,140
I bet y'all would love to hear Flora.

709
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,700
Yeah.

710
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
You will.

711
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,260
I have some good news, some bad news.

712
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,980
The good news is,

713
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,120
Gwar will play.

714
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,400
They will kill everyone in this entire audience.

715
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,640
The comet Ragnarok shall strike this Earth at 1030 tonight

716
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,020
and destroy all the pink normals and human beings

717
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,400
on this planet, Brave Bucks.

718
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,220
The bad news is,

719
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,800
that the great Sleazy P. Martini could not be here tonight.

720
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,160
Sorry.

721
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,920
Instead, he sent me his personal minister.

722
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,640
Yes, he has some religion, believe it or not.

723
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,320
Don't worry, I'm a preacher.

724
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,200
Yes, I'm a preacher from the church of the subgenius, Brave Bucks.

725
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,180
But I'm not going to preach for long.

726
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,620
In fact, I'm not even going to preach at all

727
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,980
because I know that you people want to rock and roll

728
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,500
and whatever it is, jump up and down, hurt each other,

729
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,340
take drugs.

730
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,740
And we've got to tell you,

731
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,920
man, this is going to be a fast show tonight

732
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,480
because there's a curfew at 1030 tonight.

733
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,560
Because the conspiracy of the normal

734
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,120
does not want you to have the kind of freedom

735
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,180
that you'd like to enjoy.

736
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,740
Anyway, I was just back to say,

737
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,180
quit Gwar.

738
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,380
By the way, if any of you ever wondered,

739
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,480
those are not rubber guns.

740
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:41,780
They're rubber suits.

741
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,520
I wish to God they were.

742
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,040
If they were rubber suits,

743
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,340
my butt would not be so sore right now.

744
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,960
But I was backstage with a band taking drugs.

745
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,220
I cannot keep up with them.

746
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,380
They take some damn strong drugs.

747
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,860
They start with PMP laced with PCT and crack.

748
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,360
And then they take canisters of mace.

749
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,060
And huff them.

750
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,340
They suck mace out of a can.

751
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,100
I had to cut a really good line right there

752
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,580
about groupies, let's say.

753
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,840
The comfort with their nakedity.

754
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,280
Anyway, friends, you're in for an evening

755
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,240
of glorious hate.

756
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,060
Hate and destruction.

757
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,820
And music for the end of the world, dear friends.

758
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,400
And I'm here to perform the last rite.

759
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,640
For the planet.

760
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,360
Oh, by the way, I was warned

761
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,500
that audiences here in Chicago

762
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,580
are the most violent, mean, depraved audiences in the world.

763
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,380
Yee-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye!

764
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,480
Time for a play, Chicago!

765
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Oh, God.

766
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,240
See, it...

767
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,520
Yeah, it's awful, friends.

768
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,560
That's what it took in order to survive at all

769
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,880
in the seriously demanding,

770
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,980
in some ways, world of heavy metal rock and roll concerts.

771
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,140
What they're demanding of, I think,

772
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,980
is that you be able to play a guitar.

773
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,040
And I can't play a darn guitar.

774
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,700
I can hardly even play a tape, dear friends.

775
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,200
Oh, but that I can do.

776
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,200
The only difference between Church of the Subgenius

777
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
and all the other ones is,

778
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,400
at least we admit how full of bulls we are.

779
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,580
And the one thing that the Church of the Subgenius

780
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,860
has in common with GWAR

781
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,600
is that we fuck.

782
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,080
We hate the conspiracy of the normal, ordinary human being.

783
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,580
Hate!

784
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,280
Hate is what it's all about.

785
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,540
The warranty on this planet is about to expire,

786
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,740
and Bob Dobbs is the one who can provide you

787
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,700
the extended service policy.

788
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,740
And Bob Dobbs is the one who's been

789
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,400
holding this all this time.

790
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,680
All right.

791
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,900
We'll see you next time.

792
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,180
Take care.

793
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


794
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


795
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


796
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


797
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


798
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


799
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,220
Bye.

800
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:34,580


801
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:34,580


802
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:34,660


803
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:34,660


804
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:34,660


805
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:34,660


806
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,020
Bye.

807
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


808
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


809
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


810
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


811
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


812
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


813
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,020


814
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,060
Bye.

815
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,480
Bye.

816
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,060
Did you ever feel confused?

817
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,240
All become to their use

818
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,340
You know, hit the gas, the juice

819
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,600
Maybe you should watch the news

820
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,360
We have loyal

821
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,420
We have higher

822
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,600
We ignore you

823
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,720
We were sent here to destroy you

824
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,600
We have loyal

825
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,760
We ignore you

826
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,740
We ignore you

827
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,920
We were sent here to destroy you

828
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,300
We won't have to wait too long

829
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,400
Lots of people making bombs

830
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,820
City bombs

831
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,960
Fertilizer bombs

832
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:35,740
Fertilizer bombs

833
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,580
Yeah

834
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,620
Totally amusing

835
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,940
You wonder why our lives are crumbling

836
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,060
You won't give us any money

837
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,080
Without asking what you get

838
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,260
To give up your fucking sex

839
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,320
But your actions, they shall flow me

840
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,380
They're just waiting for the moment

841
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,440
Now I'm thinking that just me

842
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,620
One day I'll pass on your grave

843
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,740
How do you know?

844
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,740
Stand up and say, I'm not your enemy

845
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:05,740


846
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,620
One, two, go

847
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,800
We are a race

848
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,760
One, two, go

849
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,900
We'll smash your face

850
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,820
One, two, go

851
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,640
You're a machine

852
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,620
One, two, go

853
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,960
I find obscene

854
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,840
One, two, go

855
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,920
Know what I mean?

856
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,780
You can do something, do nothing

857
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,740
You really fucking think you're something

858
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,900
Hold on, baby, time is coming

859
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,360
Yes!

860
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,720
Yeah, we might be four, you know, I had it.

861
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,560
I had a job at one time.

862
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,920
I had an experience at a job.

863
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,880
I was pulling in good 40 Gs.

864
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,260
Had a car, plenty of credit cards.

865
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,560
And then I found Bob.

866
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,280
Now I'm happy.

867
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,220
Dumbass!

868
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,620
A brief moment there of the sales table

869
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,400
outside the GWAR concert in Chicago or Milwaukee or someplace.

870
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,760
The sacred agent, Steve Devalaqua,

871
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,560
would run the sacred sales table

872
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,660
trying to sell the swag, the Dobbs t-shirt,

873
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,120
the shorts and magnet, you know, fridge magnets and tapes and so forth

874
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,180
to these metalheads who'd never heard of this stuff.

875
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,360
It got into some pretty intense discussions every now and then.

876
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,820
But boy, they didn't want to buy anything

877
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,460
until the very last night that we were on the tour.

878
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,940
Reverend Devalaqua, in desperation, finally,

879
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,380
happened upon the secret sales formula

880
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,420
that would work even for the rock and roll audience.

881
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,480
The kid would come up to Steve and say,

882
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,420
you know, well, like, what's this subgenius thing all about?

883
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,820
And instead of Steve trying to explain how the kid's slack had been robbed away

884
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,060
by the conspiracy, he would say,

885
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,760
Church of the Subgenius?

886
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,760
Oh, it's this thing that started in Texas

887
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,060
and then it became really popular in California.

888
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,220
And now it's what all the kids in Seattle are doing.

889
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,600
And the kid would invariably at that point go,

890
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,120
oh, I'll take one of those shirts.

891
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh, man.

892
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,880
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, dear friend.

893
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,240
You know, so, but I'm happy.

894
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,900
That's the difference.

895
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,680
That's what really counts.

896
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,260
I freed myself from the shackles of the conspiracy.

897
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Are you guys anti-religion or pro?

898
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,420
Oh, we're pro.

899
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,340
Believe it or not.

900
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:35,220
It's a disorganization for mutants, misfits, disbelievers,

901
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,740
or anything.

902
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,100
And for those who will believe anything,

903
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,720
the people that definitely wouldn't like it

904
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,360
are the ones who believe one thing.

905
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,180
And they aren't going to be shaken from that no matter what

906
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,200
because it makes them too uncomfortable.

907
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,320
This is for the people who are more comfortable.

908
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,780
Hi, how you doing?

909
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,400
Yeah.

910
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,880
We're kind of checking one thing out after another.

911
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,840
Who's the coolest?

912
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,620
Who's repping stones?

913
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,220
So Bob's been around?

914
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,900
Bob's been around.

915
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,880
Bob's been around, yeah.

916
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,800
I knew Bob a long time ago.

917
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,520
Really?

918
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,620
Did you meet Bob?

919
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,760
Did you ever meet Bob?

920
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,360
I know a lot of Bob's friends.

921
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
I saw him get killed once.

922
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,540
I actually did see him.

923
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,960
The one time I saw him in person was the first time he was assassinated.

924
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,580
In San Francisco.

925
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,720
Yeah, it was like 1980.

926
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,340
He gets killed quite a bit.

927
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,660
Yeah, he gets killed by his own followers.

928
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,340
That's not cool.

929
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,080
You know, otherwise it turns into just any old bridge.

930
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,180
So it's like we don't know.

931
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,320
So Bob got killed.

932
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,320
We saw him get killed for the first time.

933
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,400
And he got killed many times.

934
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,320
He was shot, I believe.

935
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,720
Yeah.

936
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,400
I saw the video.

937
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,920
It's on the Rise video, actually.

938
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,960
For $20.

939
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,620
Yeah.

940
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,420
That's that.

941
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,640
No, no, no.

942
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,380
He bounces back.

943
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,280
It's like, you know, when Bugs Bunny gets blown up.

944
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,060
Like Jason Mayer?

945
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,720
He shows up with a bandaid on, you know.

946
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,320
It's fun.

947
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,920
It's fun to, you know, kill your profits.

948
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:43,640
Right.

949
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,420
He's Bob Dobbs.

950
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,540
Yeah.

951
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,800
You know, he's a horrible fraud.

952
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,760
Bob Dobbs.

953
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,620
Well, is there any way to prove it?

954
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,200
Is there any way to prove it?

955
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,600
The more you struggle against the net, the more enmeshed you become.

956
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:55,880
We have questions.

957
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:02,020
You know, what you all need to do is subscribe to my successful course in sex and real estate.

958
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,720
That's right.

959
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:02,940
You do.

960
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:02,940


961
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:02,940


962
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:02,940


963
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:02,940


964
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:02,940


965
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,180
He did it himself, and look what a success he's been just in the last two hours.

966
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,000
That's right.

967
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,820
It's just amazing.

968
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,840
You could be me on my houseboat with two bucks and companions, or my giant mansion with

969
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,800
terrified cowering servants and fleet of luxury automobiles.

970
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,600
But, of course, if you want real happiness, you could own Dockstock Central.

971
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,140
You could own Dockstock Island.

972
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,940
You could own the cliffs of Dockstock right here on the cliffs of Dockstock.

973
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,860
Could you really become a millionaire if you are open to the possibilities?

974
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:32,920
You can become a millionaire if you are open to the possibilities.

975
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:43,380
And if you want more than the material wealth offered by this smarmy world, you could be

976
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,720
swimming in a bucket of pills on this show.

977
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,400
And you could be fighting against those little gel capsules washing over your head.

978
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,800
You could be digesting them as we speak at Dockstock.

979
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,780
You could be about to join in on the head launching for today.

980
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:02,920
Thank you.

981
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,080
You could be attempting to do something with the material wealth of the world.

982
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,300
None of that was funny.

983
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,540
That's not funny.

984
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,380
Then we offer a higher road.

985
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,600
It's up to you to choose.

986
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:24,240
And it means, you can join us in the future somehow.

987
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,980
And when Dockstock is a little bit safer for people like you and me.

988
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,880
And...

989
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,840
many of our middle-aged female.

990
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,460
You won't have to actually bring your own starter fluid and lubrication.

991
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,240
We've got a whole show to sell you.

992
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,180
Indeed.

993
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,500
So send your DocTalk pre-registration fee.

994
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,260
You can't extrude your own substance.

995
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,560
Yes, but you can excrete.

996
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,120
No, you can't.

997
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,460
Let us draw a curtain over this.

998
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,800
Gentlemen, you can't do that.

999
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,540
We have 11 minutes left of excretion.

1000
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,840
Okay, so call us now.

1001
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,040
What was that number again?

1002
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,420
How are these kids getting it?

1003
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,300
Are they Xeroxing it?

1004
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:20,280
They're getting it from Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1005
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,020
I'm going to give that number again.

1006
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,120
This is the address for Bob.

1007
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,380
This is the address to write for information about this very thing you're hearing now.

1008
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,520
That's Bob.

1009
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:30,900
Bob.

1010
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,680
Bob.

1011
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,580
No, you do want to do it.

1012
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:43,740
At Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1013
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,100
This is surface noise in the background.

1014
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,740
Long body and a sound bar.

1015
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,580
Yeah.

1016
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,300
We have you.

1017
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,020
Call the police.

1018
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:10,320
Yeah, well, no, my feelings were doing some, were picking up something, but it was just static.

1019
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,440
I hope.

1020
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:12,660
Well.

1021
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,540
Yeah, no, those guys, the guys in the bear suits were just doing an advertisement.

1022
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,220
Do they want money?

1023
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,740
Mafia suits and the rubber mafia suits were working for, not, they're not working for Guar.

1024
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,260
They're working for Guar's management.

1025
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,660
Guar is okay.

1026
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,380
Oh, for sleazy.

1027
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,620
Don't pay any attention to this.

1028
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,340
I want to go down in the other room.

1029
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,160
You know, they feed them, and then they let them out of the cage.

1030
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,060
They go out, and they do the show, and they go back in the cage.

1031
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,700
For the manager, what's his name?

1032
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,740
Sleazy or something, right?

1033
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,380
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1034
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,480
And he sleazy gives them the pay.

1035
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,320
Hey, we're in the middle of our radio sign.

1036
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,260
Reach deep, deep, deep, deep into your pocket.

1037
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,120
A T-shirt.

1038
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,920
A deep pool, a pocket pool.

1039
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,020
And grapple with that organ that you feel down there deep in your pocket.

1040
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,600
It's called your wallet.

1041
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,080
Wallet gland.

1042
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:07,660
Pull it slowly out of its receptacle.

1043
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,760
And pop it out.

1044
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,640
And de-beak it, whip it open.

1045
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,080
Yank out that cash and call 687-6900.

1046
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,680
And if you place $25, you get yourself a 95 edition T-shirt.

1047
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,240
They will tell you the secret code behind that phone number.

1048
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,180
The secret lyrics.

1049
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,740
I'm saying that.

1050
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,480
When you buy.

1051
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,480
When you buy cartel foods, punishments or ointments,

1052
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,580
or any kind of luxury entertainment item like a record,

1053
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,760
it does not in any way affect the Church of the Subgenius

1054
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,420
except for to make Reverend Stang poorer,

1055
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,440
unless you buy his or her products.

1056
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,180
Oh, that's what I thought you said.

1057
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,140
But I didn't want to say it too loud,

1058
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,400
just in case, you know, the guys were standing out in front of the door

1059
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,200
smoking a cigarette.

1060
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,640
No, the communists are out to get us.

1061
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,060
And big business is out to get us.

1062
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,240
Well, I've talked to a few.

1063
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,520
I guess it's a sign.

1064
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,420
It's a sign of success to have the mob, you know, trying to bully you.

1065
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, you know, they kind of make their little statement, you know.

1066
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,000
You're not really.

1067
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,340
It's like when the government has a dossier.

1068
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,620
You haven't really made it until, you know, you've met up with some of the suits, you know.

1069
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,540
So if I were to look at it that way, I'd say you're due for some success, buddy.

1070
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,200
Maybe somewhere on a lonely road between here and Columbus or something.

1071
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,320
But, gee, boy, that sounds.

1072
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,020
It sounds.

1073
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,260
Show business is really exciting.

1074
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,140
It is.

1075
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,240
It is, especially when you travel with a band that is named after something which is bad for your teeth.

1076
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,140
Jeez, this thing's got stuck right in here.

1077
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,200
But I don't even know why or how the increments got involved

1078
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,220
or how you managed to play with them so often for the next few months.

1079
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:56,480
Well, I'm only going to play with them until it wears off.

1080
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,460
Until it turns black and falls off.

1081
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:03,680
But it could wear on tomorrow night, couldn't it, at the Odeon Theater if you were to go there?

1082
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:03,820
Oh, man.

1083
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,160
Oh, the thought is so odious.

1084
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,400
But it's actually, tomorrow could be the end of the world.

1085
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:17,660
The band apparently has decided that this is going to be their only performance

1086
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,200
because there's not going to be a planet Earth left after tomorrow night.

1087
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,100
You mean they already know something we don't know?

1088
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,040
Well, there's a comet.

1089
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,620
There's a comet that is apparently on the way to Earth.

1090
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,040
And the scientists have been, you know, laughing it off because it's, you know,

1091
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,840
It's going to blast into the Earth, so I'm sorry.

1092
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,720
The medicine worms were not in line.

1093
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,220
It wasn't lined up with the medicine worms in such a way that it was going to hit Earth.

1094
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,860
But Guar knows better.

1095
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,920
Guar knows better.

1096
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,400
The idea is that tomorrow night at the Odeon Theater,

1097
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:58,020
they're going to defeat the one bad force so that they can become the other bad force.

1098
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,040
And hitch a ride on the comet in some metaphysical sense.

1099
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,140
They call this comet Ragnarok.

1100
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,120
Well, see, that's what I thought was the ultimate purpose of their organ,

1101
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,260
was to ultimately meld or merge with the Ragnarok and the grogs of old,

1102
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,520
which came out as some kind of space dummies and beat everybody up.

1103
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,140
But that wasn't supposed to happen until way beyond X-Day even.

1104
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,240
But so it's happening tomorrow?

1105
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,740
Well, that's what they think.

1106
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,020
But, you see, here's the thing.

1107
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,360
Here's the deal.

1108
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,720
If Guar is right and the world ends tomorrow,

1109
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,160
then I stand to lose my plane ticket, my plane fare, you know.

1110
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:45,960
But if they're wrong and the world continues to end night after night after night,

1111
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,160
then they have to fulfill the contract and I come out ahead.

1112
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,420
That's why the mafia is here.

1113
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,480
They're kind of like the insurance company.

1114
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,000
That's made up of people.

1115
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,900
They're making sure that everything works.

1116
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,540
They work for the record company.

1117
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,220
I mean, the record company is hand in hand.

1118
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,600
You know, they're in bed with the shop.

1119
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,760
Yeah, we all know that.

1120
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,220
We're all conspiracy buffs down here.

1121
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,060
We know they're all in with the, yeah.

1122
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,280
Poppin'.

1123
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,600
They're in with, and Smirsh.

1124
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,760
And Smirsh, too.

1125
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,180
Yeah.

1126
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,340
Yeah, Smirsh and the rest of the underworld.

1127
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,280
In fact, there are some underworld groups.

1128
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,280
And KGB.

1129
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,740
Well, the KGB remnant units?

1130
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,960
Or are you talking about the old...

1131
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,800
Iron Green Butt.

1132
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:27,980
Iron Green Butt.

1133
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,660
Oh, I missed that one about Beatrice.

1134
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,340
The Foods Corporation.

1135
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,760
They have their own hit squads.

1136
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,920
And it's all over a lousy potato chip.

1137
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,080
Bet you can't eat one.

1138
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,180
Bet, you know, better, you better, you know, so on.

1139
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,220
Eat a couple thousand or I'll blow off your face.

1140
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,360
And speaking of coming out ahead,

1141
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,160
how many times have it, has it been in your life

1142
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,720
since you, you know, you've always been coming out a big fat head?

1143
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,540
And yet, you know, you're not gonna make a single dime off this tour

1144
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,480
if these guys rub you, you know, the wrong way and stuff.

1145
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,780
Well, get this.

1146
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,660
We have to charge as much for our pills

1147
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,120
as they charge for their pills.

1148
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,720
It's like they throw buckets of pills to the audience.

1149
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,900
And we've done that, you know, both.

1150
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,740
We've done that for years, too.

1151
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,600
Yes.

1152
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,480
And it's a good...

1153
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,520
Luckily, the pills are completely different.

1154
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,320
They're sort of counteract ours.

1155
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,520
So you're saying absolutely nothing will happen?

1156
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,160
Right.

1157
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,500
Ours make you bleed and theirs clot.

1158
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,100
Blood clot.

1159
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,900
You're listening to WCSB.
