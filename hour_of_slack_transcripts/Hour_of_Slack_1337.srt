1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
All right, friends.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,520
All right.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,940
This is it.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,160
You're still calling them friends, I know.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,040
They'd better be friends at this juncture, Ivan.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,020
Because this is the last hour of slack in human history.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,700
Yes.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,480
We're about to do the last hour of slack ever.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,100
And it's taken years to come to this point.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,060
One hates to think of the sacrifices that have been made.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:33,000
There have been 1,320 hours of slack.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,840
And that there will be no more.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,940
Because time himself will be slain.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,940
And we shall slay him.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,180
We shall wipe our bloody blade upon his beard,

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,660
where he lies, bleeding cogwheels and gears,

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,940
his pendulum disintegrating.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,600
At this apex, this crucial moment of history.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,720
And no one shall flinch

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,040
and flinch

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,420
and falter.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,760
The finest hour of slack.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,580
And the last hour of slack.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,820
We will kill time.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,080
We will kill death.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,720
We will fuck sex.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,480
And I won't even have to cut that part.

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,240
No, keep that in.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I personally will be glad to be lifted up tomorrow at 7 a.m.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,700
Partly so that I can get some sleep.

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,900
But also because then Starwood will begin on my saucer.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,480
And I don't have to film and record everything that happens there.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,500
Which means nothing will be recorded or photographed there.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,380
Pulpy alien hands will rub liniment on your aching limbs.

35
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,640
No longer bowed by terrestrial gravity.

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,900
I don't know about the rest of you,

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,060
but I do know the meaning of pain.

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,160
I have been feeling it.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,980
Just the...

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,160
Too much fun, I guess.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,480
And have you been feeling everyone else's pain?

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,880
No.

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,020
In a Clinton-esque fashion?

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,380
No.

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,860
No, I do not feel anyone else's pain.

46
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,560
And if you ask me to, I won't touch your sores.

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,300
However, oh, I have one little...

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,580
Well, not that anyone involved is listening right now,

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:19,880
but I would like to pay the gas money of the bands and the main speakers

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,960
before we leave the earth.

51
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,780
Because money will be useless.

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,320
It's like Abe Lincoln paying his two-cent debt before he died.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,420
It just sews up loose ends.

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,060
Now, ironically enough, you know, Dr. Howell,

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,060
many of the subgeniuses will leave this afternoon

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,500
and go back to their jobs.

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,100
Or rather, more narrowly speaking,

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,220
they'll be going toward their jobs and homes.

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,120
Hopefully, they'll wake up at quarter of seven,

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,700
fold their...

61
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,220
get into the position of supplication with their butts in the air

62
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,180
and wait to be lifted up.

63
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,060
And by 7.15, if nothing happens,

64
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,400
I guess they'll have to get in their car and drive to work.

65
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,960
Too bad.

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,300
That would indeed be tragic.

67
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,220
It would be tragic indeed,

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,960
because it means I would have to clean up the sets here

69
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,600
and pull down the decorations on the stage and all that.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,360
And I really would rather just let the robot,

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
the killer robots do that.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,740
Let them crisply incinerate it in a bolt of actinic flame.

73
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,020
But again, friends, if you're one of the bands that played,

74
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,480
before you leave tonight,

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,160
you might want to go ahead and hit me up for the gas money.

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,500
Of course, old Ivan Stang, he's good for that gas money.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,440
It looks like the Subgenius Foundation will have made,

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
according to my calculations...

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,460
Oh, never let them know.

80
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,120
...at least $250 off of this X-Day.

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,940
Praise Bob.

82
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,720
I'll be able to retire on that, on my escape vessel.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,880
It'll help you furnish your stateroom.

84
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,100
That's way more than three times my money back for eternal salvation.

85
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,400
So not only did I get eternal salvation,

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,040
but my business will have made another $150 or so on top of it.

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,940
So we thank everyone who managed to make it here.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,460
I know it was really difficult.

89
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,260
Satan and Jesus, Muhammad and the Buddha

90
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,020
all worked against many of the bands and attendees,

91
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,680
causing car trouble and maybe in some case their own lack of maintenance.

92
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,120
I can't blame it all on the gods, I guess.

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,000
So remember to change your oil or refill your oil before you head back home.

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,020
It's only a thousand miles for some of us.

95
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,760
But hopefully, friends, when we head home, it will be home to the saucers.

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,380
Home to us.

97
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,040
Home to the spaces gleaming among the eternal stars.

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Like the Mormons awaiting to return to the planet God lives on, Kolob.

99
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,500
Actually, they get there after a long journey on their part.

100
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,120
They don't immediately zoom there.

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,360
Like the Christian heaven, you zoom there, but Mormons take a long way around.

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,260
He said to his friends,

103
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,460
If the saucers arrive, we will be ruptured.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm ready.

105
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,320
Are you?

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,440
I will not know that until the moment, for ye never know when the master cometh.

107
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,120
I'm glad that you know you're ready.

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,060
I would like that certainty too.

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,600
Doubt is all pervasive.

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,100
Only faith can countermand it.

111
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm going to try.

112
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
That's all I can say.

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,440
I'm going to do my best.

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Maybe I'm too attached to this world in spite of all my presentation,

115
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,560
all my stuff to be ruptured.

116
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,460


117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,660
When it all boils away or left with whatever you've got.

118
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,620
But I'm glad that you are confident.

119
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,260
The rupture, you know, is the rupture with everything that you leave behind.

120
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,580
That tears away like the sting of a bee left in the stung.

121
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,480
And the rest of you that flies away is the new you.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Fires will light the sky

123
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,580
When the saucers are flying in

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,440
The world will glow

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,800
As pinks burn

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
Their only sin

127
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,960
All they ever had to do

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,660
Was pay $30 just like me and you

129
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
But come the 5th of July

130
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Hate to tell you folks

131
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,460
You're all gonna die

132
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,460
带在大街上

133
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,460


134
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,460


135
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,580
maybe no longer

136
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,860
שק女 in city database

137
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,420
are going down to shake their asses

138
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,480
in the smolderingологии

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,300
among the unworthy

140
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:50,500
Sex goddesses in their saucer crafts Coming down to shake their ass and dance

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,360
Upon the bodies of the unworthy

142
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Oh, speaking of the 7 a.m. arrival of the saucers

143
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,900
Yes, we should tell you

144
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,700
We made an important decision

145
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,480
Where that saucer was

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,100
It's going to be

147
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,140
We had kind of left it up

148
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,660
We weren't sure where the best place would be to gather

149
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,540
And I think in the brochure

150
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,240
It says to gather at the main stage down there

151
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,420
Where the loud music was last night

152
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,460
We'll have to put a sign there

153
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,380
Thanks everybody for the incredible bass playing

154
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,500
And guitar playing

155
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,720
And singing

156
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,640
Yes, yes

157
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,080
And ranting

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
But anyway

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,240
We found the perfect place for the 7 a.m. thing

160
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,460
Now I understand that half of you

161
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,840
At least

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,400
Will be laying in your bed with hangovers

163
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,560
And that's how your eternity will be forever

164
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,180
In your blistering hot tent

165
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,400
But those of you who either stay up all night

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,900
Or like I do

167
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,580
Get a good night's sleep beforehand

168
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,060
Then put on your Sunday best

169
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,860
And come out there Tuesday morning

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,240
The place to gather is not at the main stage

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,180
And not here

172
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,280
But at an area called the Stone Circle

173
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,080
It's down the road at East

174
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,440
It's a little place down the road

175
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,440


176
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,440


177
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,780
It's a stone circle

178
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,200
And there's a green hill and an altar

179
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,220
Surrounded in a huge round ring of stones

180
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,800
And that's where we will be

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
And where you will be

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
If you want to prove your true subgenius credentials

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,920
At the moment the mighty ships appear overhead

184
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,820
That Stone Circle is visually perfect

185
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,380
For a 7 a.m. gathering to await the saucers

186
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,000
Especially from an aerial perspective

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,740
Yes

188
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,440
It's a great place to be

189
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,040
It's easy to see from above

190
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,060
It looks like a big target

191
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,460
It's a natural landing designation

192
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,620
It has on top of that

193
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,100
An ancestor mound

194
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,920
And a turtle mound

195
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,000
The turtle mound I think is a trick

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Because I didn't see any turtles there

197
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,060
And the ancestor mound isn't very big

198
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,200
So whoever built it didn't have many ancestors

199
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,140
Well people in the olden days were smaller than us

200
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,080
We are huge brontotheriums of the primate species

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,420
But our progenitors were about the same size as us

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
About 4 feet tall

203
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
A scrawny and agile

204
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,520
They could run in front of a charging mammoth all day

205
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,640
And then eat a few roots and grubs and berries

206
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
If they were lucky enough to find them

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
Which themselves may have been our ancestors

208
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,680
That's candy

209
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,940
The grubs, the cricket, the leech

210
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,840
Nature's perfect food, sugar

211
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,940
Our great-great-grandfather

212
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,120
Our great-great-grandmother

213
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,700
Those aren't real berries

214
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,360
They're candy

215
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,100
I told you they were candy

216
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,420
They're a simulacrum of candy

217
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,860
They're a simulacrum of the berry

218
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,020
Not the actual thing

219
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,820
Not that they're not plenty tasty

220
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, exactly

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,060
It's the result that we're interested in

222
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,120
So to conclude

223
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,380
At the moment on X-Day

224
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,300
Be at the stone circle

225
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,360
Near the altar stone

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,640
It's down the road a piece to the left

227
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,220
As you will see if you visit the swimming pond

228
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,080
It may be a farther walk

229
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,140
Than most of you have taken

230
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,940
Since you were 10 years old

231
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,980
But it will be worth it

232
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,220
And luckily

233
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,560
The subgenius hierarchites

234
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,100
And control freaks

235
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,820
Have golf carts

236
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,460
So we can shuttle you

237
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,980
If you appear down here

238
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,160
About 6.30 or so

239
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Otherwise

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,400
We will be able to take you up to the

241
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,080
And if you're polite

242
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,100
Physical exercise

243
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,440
While you still have feet

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
Right, yeah

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,280
Use your legs

246
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,420
It's going to be the last time

247
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,520
You'll have to take a walk

248
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,540
And if you've heard the expression

249
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,020
My legs are on fire

250
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,040
Somebody help me

251
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,980
I ain't got no legs

252
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,420
Well, you're right

253
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,020
You'll see this book

254
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,140
Practically

255
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,220
Into use

256
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,440
It'll be the last time

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll ever have to get up at 6.30

258
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,540
It'll be the end of a lot of things

259
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,340
And the beginning of even more

260
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,920
So we hope you'll join us there

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,420
And if you can't be there physically

262
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,920
At least send your astral projection

263
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,980
At the end of the road

264
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,340
Yes, but that's so tenuous

265
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,280
It might blow away in a strong wind

266
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,040
Well, we'll have our dream catchers out there

267
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,700
In order to

268
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,340
Yeah, well

269
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,120
We were talking about the ectoplasm before

270
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,400
But it is still there

271
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,940
So insubstantial

272
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,720
Compared to the endoplasm

273
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,400
Ghosts want life and warmth

274
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
But they can't have it

275
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
But that's why if you want to

276
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,420
To call them to you

277
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,480
You want to put down a little bowl of blood

278
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,840
As all the authorities state

279
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
For them to drink

280
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,780
They want to feel

281
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,560
Some semblance of life

282
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,580
And they and other things are waiting

283
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,500
If you don't care for the gift

284
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,100
Of being a warm, living, sentient being

285
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,540
A bit more

286
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
Somebody else's

287
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,180
Would love to take your place

288
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,900
Walk-ins, they're called

289
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,640
As opposed to step-ins

290
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,020
And then there's the watchers

291
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,740
The watchers in the picture frames

292
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,140
The spirits that are entrapped by the glass

293
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,360
Yes, they have tricked themselves

294
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,280
Painted themselves into a corner

295
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,040
Eternally

296
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,060
They also have a sad lesson for us to learn

297
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,920
Hey, I wonder if the ancestors

298
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,360
Will be ruptured up

299
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,120
They may

300
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,460
We may see the surface of the mound crumble

301
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,140
And those

302
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,620
Stately figures

303
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,460
Shedding clods of earth

304
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,400
Emerge from underground

305
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,140
Oh, you can expect to see all sorts of things

306
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,460
Happen as time runs backwards

307
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,200
And all scores are settled

308
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,040
And the great thing is

309
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Once you're on your

310
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,820
Don't worry about taking pictures

311
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,240
During the end of the world

312
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Everything is recorded from that moment on

313
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
Everything's going fine

314
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,960
On the all-permeating world computer

315
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,660
Called WOM

316
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,320
Which is actually

317
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,800
Composed of tiny particles of dust in the air

318
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,860
Little nano-machines on the walls

319
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,120
Inside your skin

320
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,460
Little nattering nano-machines

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes, they all record everything

322
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,120
And you can watch all of your enemies

323
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,340
Ten billion

324
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,920
At your leisure

325
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,680
You can watch how everyone you ever hated

326
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
Died slowly

327
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,320
All recorded by seething, juddering nanobots

328
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
You can even bring them back to life

329
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,400
And kill them again and again and again

330
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,460
That's it

331
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,420
I have a certain fifth grade teacher

332
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
Mrs. Darden

333
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, I'm sure she's in her grave now

334
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,340
But not for long

335
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,320
But she won't be for long

336
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to bring her out of there and say

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Now, how did you ask me to spell the word several

338
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,980
At the spelling bee, Mrs. Darden

339
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,800
In fifth grade

340
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,460
She said, well, I said it real clearly

341
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,380
Spell servile

342
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,440
S-E-R-V-I-L-E

343
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
Servile

344
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,520
Oh, um

345
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,660
Let me say that one more time

346
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,060
She knew I was a good student

347
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm a good speller

348
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,680
Servile

349
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,820
S-E-R-V-I-L-E

350
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,840
Sorry

351
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,460
Next, Pobucker

352
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,460
S-E-V-E-R-I-L

353
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,860
Servile

354
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,580
Friends

355
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,860
This is the kind of thing that a fifth grade teacher deserves to die for

356
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,800
Mispronouncing a word in a spelling bee

357
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,760
I could have won the national spelling bee

358
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,400
If that redneck Fort Worth Pobucker hadn't done

359
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Mispronouncing a word in a spelling bee

360
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,860
He wants that word for me to spell

361
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,200
And why do you think I worked so hard at the Church of the Subgenius

362
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,840
To end the stupidity in the

363
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,060
Well, not the stupidity

364
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,900
But the pinkness

365
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,360
We have nothing against stupidity

366
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,160
We'd call this Church of the Genius if that was the situation

367
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,020
It's the pinkness

368
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,300
That must be wiped out, erased, forever

369
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,840
On the other hand, one might argue

370
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,800
If one were in an argumentative mood

371
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,440
That that's the way it is

372
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,960
That teacher's malfeasance was one of the things which set your feet on the long path

373
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,880
Toward being the head of the Church of the Subgenius

374
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,840
It's true that I might not have hated enough to be available for this job

375
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
Had those things not happened in my childhood

376
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,220
That doesn't obviate the need for rectification and revenge

377
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,780
I look ahead with hope

378
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,820
Hope for revenge, friends

379
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,280
See, I'm not bitter at all

380
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
Curse of revenge

381
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,420
Hope for revenge

382
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,900
For endless years, eternities of revenge

383
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,360
And then I'll get around to reading all those comic books

384
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,140
And watching all those movies that I've missed

385
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,500
That first time

386
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,820
You won't even have to read them all

387
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,040
You'll find that you've outgrown some of them

388
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,120
Speaking of which, I heard that

389
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,860
Playboy magazine has got all of their back issues online now

390
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,040
How cold, half-blooded and digital of them?

391
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,140
Well, it's not the same as having a stuck together old tattered magazine

392
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,120
In the bathroom with you, but by golly, times have changed, you know

393
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,080
That glowing screen, the significant other

394
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,400
The music in the background, by the way, is Doctors for Bob

395
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Doctors for Bob!

396
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,020
The very first Doctor band

397
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,880
They invented the concept of anti-music

398
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,760
Which I've always hated, by the way

399
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,360
I'd like to state now, in the very last hour of Slack

400
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,320
That I was never so sorry as I am about the day that we printed the...

401
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,340
Concept of anti-music in Book of the Subgenius

402
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,440
Those self-absorbed twerps, those punks

403
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,860
Well, but we absorbed it

404
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,160
Doctors for Bob did actually learn how to play

405
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,140
And that's what we're hearing now in the background

406
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,140
Yeah, then they had to live up to their rep

407
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,980
Yeah, they kicked Snavely out because he never learned how to play

408
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,280
And he was the one who started the damn band!

409
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,080
Ah, such injustice

410
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,640
Well, anyway, enough of that

411
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,300
You can take the Subgenius History course on your pleasure, Socrates

412
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,640
And it will be free!

413
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,160
It won't be 135 bucks anymore

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,380
And as for Doctors for Bob and the Swingin' Love Corpses

415
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,580
And other bands, you'll be hearing them

416
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,080
Night and day, or what passes for night and day

417
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,840
At that place, it is the end of the world

418
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,000
The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for

419
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
I agree with the second part

420
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,140
This is the end

421
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,220
Well, it's not really the end of our

422
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,660
But it is the last of the 14X Day shows

423
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,160
And by gobs, if 15X Day won't be upon us before we know it

424
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,620
The music we just heard was the Kleptones

425
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,540
And the song earlier was Priestess Pisces with Six-Tailed Fists of Connie

426
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,780
Or whatever the jam band was Wednesday night

427
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,980
The music in the background is Boron Nuzzle at 14X Day

428
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,000
What we're about to get to are the recordings of July 5th, 7am

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,760
From the video camera that I was shooting with the whole time

430
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,860
Thanks to Pastor Gagpole

431
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,660
It has been edited for brevity and legality

432
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,960
And so, back to 14X Day Drill on location and in 3D at Wisteria

433
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,120
Friends, before we start herding and bullying people

434
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Towards the golf cart

435
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,400
Dr. Hal is going to treat us to a recitation

436
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,680
Or a treatise

437
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,640
Because you are brave to be here

438
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,820
And undergo this

439
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,640
This is from Dylan Thomas

440
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,020
And death shall have no dominion

441
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,660
Dead men, naked, they shall be one

442
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,020
With the man in the wind and the west moon

443
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,660
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone

444
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,980
They shall have stars at elbow and foot

445
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,900
Though they go mad, they shall be sane

446
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,460
Though they sink through the sea, they shall rise again

447
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,480
Though lovers be lost, love shall not

448
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,660
And death shall have no dominion

449
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,280
And death shall have no dominion

450
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,500
Under the windings of the sea

451
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,280
They lying long shall not die windily

452
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,900
Twisting on racks till sinews give way

453
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,720
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break

454
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
Faith in their hands shall snap in two

455
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,340
And the unicorn evils run them through

456
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,020
Split all ends up, they shan't crack

457
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,100
And death shall have no dominion

458
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,680
And death shall have no dominion

459
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,160
No more shall gulls cry in their ears

460
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,600
Or waves break loud on the sea shore

461
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,700
Where blew a flower may a flower no more lift its head

462
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,380
To the blows of the rain

463
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,860
Though they go mad and dead as nails

464
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,020
Heads of the character hammer through daisies

465
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,180
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down

466
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,600
And death shall have no dominion

467
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,300
The last hour of slack has come to an end

468
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,160
Praise Bob, praise Dr. Howe, praise the subgeniuses

469
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,880
And hail the American people

470
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,700
The exes who we shall meet within less than 24 hours

471
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,820
Let's enter through the sacred druid

472
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,640
I told everyone you would be killed in a tragic car wreck

473
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,380
And then you all were stunned and shot

474
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,380
Silent mash moments there at the circle

475
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,600
Everybody looked at each other, it was hilarious

476
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,600
You said that I got killed in a car wreck?

477
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,020
I said that you guys had been killed in a car wreck on the way here

478
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,480
And then you like rolled around the corner right behind us

479
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,400
Right inside it

480
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,720
Not that a subgenius would lie

481
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,260
That is all

482
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,720
What a lovely expanse of the saved

483
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,300
So my god, but hey shouldn't Bob be in a chair?

484
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,440
I know he's passed out and everything but

485
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,500
He's like the crazy radio guy in 2012

486
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,620
We need him around just in case something goes wrong

487
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,300
We wouldn't want just anybody thrown into the pond

488
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,880
And punished and harassed

489
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,900
Hold on, hold on

490
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Here we go

491
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,600
What have we got here?

492
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,220
10 minutes

493
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:26,880
I've decided that I'm going to see this rupture out through the viewfinder of a video camera

494
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,780
It's the only way that I can know everything's being recorded for one thing

495
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,100
You learn that the hard way

496
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,380
Give me seats and digits

497
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,200
It shows a lack of faith thing

498
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,820
What I want to know from the deuce paying subgeniuses is

499
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,220
How do you feel reverend scum right now?

500
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,360
A little hungover but I'm waiting for the exes to come in

501
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,520
Have you been up all night?

502
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,980
No, not as late as some of these fools

503
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,840
How about you lights out?

504
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,800
These darn kids have been up partying all night

505
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,520
So you got a little rest?

506
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,860
I got a little bit of rest

507
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,440
How about you two? Did you guys get any rest tonight?

508
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,460
A little bit

509
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,820
See now they show some faith

510
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,920
I mean if you gotta do it, go all the way

511
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,720
You're gonna feel much better very very soon

512
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm ready, I'm lubed up and waiting

513
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,200
I have uh, this camera will last exactly 40 minutes in batteries

514
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,200
So that should give me 10 minutes of the end of the world at least

515
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,880
I should have a better camera by then

516
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,140
I'm so glad Dr. Dark has been at, has awaited the saucers every single ex day

517
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,780
For uh, since 1996

518
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,900
Now that's either the most sensible man in the world

519
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,720
Or the dumbest sucker ever

520
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,920
Praise Dr. Dark

521
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,020
Uh, he and I have unbroken records

522
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,400
Of having uh, shown our faith enough to wake up

523
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,740
How are you feeling Eggplant?

524
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm fucking feeling great

525
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,500
You feel good?

526
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah, I'm not feeling good

527
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,700
Well you'll feel better later

528
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll feel much better once I'm out of soccer

529
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,720
Um, who stayed up all night?

530
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
You know, the

531
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,340
The, the, you look at

532
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,540
Good god, look at those eyes

533
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,700
I have a red smudge on my uh, sleeve

534
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,040
And I don't know where it came from

535
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Oh, we saw some very propitious things

536
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,620
That would indicate uh, that this may be the day

537
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,120
For instance, when I woke up this morning in the big house

538
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,380
I ran straight down to the bathroom of course

539
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,940
At where I keep a, a monster nostalgia magazine

540
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,380
And the first image that my eye fell upon

541
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,940
Was the poster for a movie called

542
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,360
The Mysterians

543
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,040
Which has a, an upside down M

544
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,980
Meaning the Wisterians

545
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,040
That was a good sign

546
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
It was right next to the poster for

547
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,240
I married a monster from outer space

548
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,180
At War of the Worlds and Voyage to the End of the Universe

549
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,880
Uh, Ministry of Slack fellows

550
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,480
Were you up all night or did you get a little sleep?

551
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,600
Got a little bit of sleep

552
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,980
Got a few hours of sleep

553
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,360
That's right

554
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,000
That's the way to do it

555
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,940
That's the way to do it

556
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,440
How about you guys, Reverend Purge?

557
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,800
Less than three

558
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,360
Less than three minutes of sleep

559
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,340
And yet look at him, he's doing great

560
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,740
He did great

561
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,540
Uh, Dr. Fox, we loved your projections last night

562
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh, well you are quite welcome

563
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,780
I was trying to use them as a geosynchronous locationing system

564
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,100
Right

565
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,960
If anyone needs to go to the bathroom

566
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,680
Reverend Fights, good to see you

567
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,300
Now may be a very good time

568
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,160
To go to the bathroom?

569
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,360
Last call for 4-2-1

570
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


571
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


572
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


573
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


574
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


575
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


576
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


577
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


578
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


579
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


580
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


581
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


582
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,360


583
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,720
Yes, I know

584
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,040
And I suppose Ray and I could go to the bathroom

585
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,440
This is the only way in which I would know

586
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,600
Of course I could go to the bathroom

587
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,600


588
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,820
Well, have fun

589
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:05,820


590
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:05,940
They're enjoying the morning

591
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:05,940


592
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:05,940


593
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,800
We'll have a view of the property

594
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,060
Back to escape from this

595
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,720
We got Johnny

596
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:26,920
play all night? Oh okay. That's good. That's good. I see you. Reverend Ferg, how

597
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:34,920
is your X Day Morn? See so far the signs are good. Susie the floozy I see is all

598
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:42,300
dolled up for her her day of destruction. Oh by the way on the way

599
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,120
here even though Princess Wee and I have made this drive a dozen times this week

600
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,440
we noticed that on one of the little rural homes is a mailbox that is marked

601
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:01,400
only by a very clear stencil of a pipe. Another portent of good. This is a typical

602
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,840
subgenius situation. For decades we've been trying to get good

603
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,740
footage of a UFO and now for the first time we're not only going to get clear

604
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,600
footage it'll be in 3D. We'll be the only people who have it. There'll be no market for it.

605
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,820
It was it was really sad. Well we've got five minutes. We are it was so sad

606
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,200
to drive through the campground and you know we know a lot of people here from

607
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:33,340
Starwood and there are a lot of virtuous pagans here but they will be treated

608
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,380
just the same as everyone who didn't send in that $30 and express that faith.

609
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:48,220
Take pets? Well you certainly can beam your pet up if you hurry.

610
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:58,380
Anna Dynamite bought Sherbet her own membership. Sherbet? Her cat. Oh right.

611
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
Meow meow meow meow meow meow. No no don't do that.

612
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,320
We've only got five minutes.

613
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,280
Four minutes left and I don't want to be hearing that meow meow song

614
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,820
at the moment of rupture. Duke of Uke how was your morning? Transplant. Transplant's amazing.

615
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:24,400
Usually what we get is wretched looking sad. Oh yeah actually that's a good idea.

616
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,480
People should get in a big circle so that we make a better image. One next

617
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,220
day we spelled out the name of Bob in bare butt.

618
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,440
Pointed up at the sky and but we didn't have any good way to photograph them.

619
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,700
Hey no no no let's we don't we don't draw attention to the documentary.

620
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,720
Don't look at the camera while you're dying friends that's important. You can

621
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:00,580
look at my camera but that's all right. It's all more real when you viddy the

622
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,320
colors of the world through the camera lens. That's all right. It's all more real when you viddy the colors of the world through the camera lens.

623
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,000
Two minutes! And what happened to that

624
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,760
I thought it was at least four

625
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,620
minutes. Don't worry about that. Now friends

626
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,680
remember this is important this is your

627
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,160
last moments with this type of gravity

628
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,020
and with this temperature. Suzy you

629
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,440
Suzy alone looks properly solemn.

630
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,720
Well she did until this now.iks appropriate

631
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,320
until just now yes so many what is it two minutes. Pmeter 2 and recording?

632
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,320


633
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,020
One minute? Oh my lord, godly, mighty, dobs!

634
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,740
Dr. Legume, I notice, is here for the first time.

635
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,660
Nobody's even looking up!

636
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,440
Oh, well, you know, it's not exactly spaceships we're waiting for.

637
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:00,500
It may be spaceships, it may be a blinding light, it might be...

638
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,840
What's the most important thing to say to the world?

639
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,660
FTW!

640
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:17,260
There is a very slight chance that a giant saucer may actually swoop down and land on top of us, killing the entire subgenius hierarchy in just a matter of seconds.

641
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,000
But it's a chance we're willing to take.

642
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,820
We've been willing to... Okay, where are we at? Ten... Is it the countdown time?

643
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,480
It's time!

644
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,160
Alright, go ahead. Oh my god.

645
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,400
Ten!

646
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,580
Nine!

647
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,460
Eight!

648
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,240
Seven!

649
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,520
Six!

650
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,600
Five!

651
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,440
Four!

652
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,460
Three!

653
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,220
Two!

654
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,180
One!

655
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,400
FUTW!

656
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,700
FUTW fight can't take a joke!

657
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,020
Keep going, keep going.

658
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Not bad, but uh...

659
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,500
Are we fucked again?

660
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,140
Jolly, we're not fucked again!

661
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,080
Damn it!

662
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,180
We're locked in a long easy-to-do-it-in-a-minute-it-is-all-we-think-we-should-do-another-countdown?

663
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,140
Don't remind them that they were going to blame me if it all went wrong.

664
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,960
Don't remind them of that.

665
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,780
Oh, sure.

666
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,940
Five, four, three, two, one...

667
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,400
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

668
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,720
Hey, um, did anybody remember the Kool-Aid this time?

669
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,860
Just goes to figure.

670
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,840
The one reward-

671
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
Rewardians ask for good.

672
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,500
One!

673
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,580
Are requested for one simple thing, the Kool-Aid, and we don't even have that!

674
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,800
It is July 5th, right? We did get that before.

675
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
It is July 5th.

676
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,380
But, what you, but...

677
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,680
Was that napkin upside down before? Was that what that was?

678
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,600
How do we know it's not 7...

679
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,820
Well, that reminds me of something.

680
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,680
Wouldn't I make it 7 PM if it was upside down?

681
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,360
No, it's just the year. But that was it.

682
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,500
Deliberate error, I'm sure.

683
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,520
Uh, now friends...

684
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,360
I remember at some point last night it being announced that if the Exes didn't show up,

685
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,820
that it would all be the fault of Dr. Legume!

686
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,980
I asked him not to remind me.

687
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,580
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

688
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,540
I never liked him anyway!

689
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
So he got him nastily!

690
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,700
I specifically asked him not to remind me.

691
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,480
Judas!

692
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,880
I'll quickly-

693
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,800
That's right.

694
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:54,980
That's right.

695
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,140
It's the worst Ex Day ever.

696
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,500
We're still here.

697
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,620
This sucks!

698
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,580
All these birds singing and grass growing crap has got to come to a fucking end!

699
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,320
This is not fucking cool!

700
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,280
I am so very, very butt hurt that you all didn't get ruptured!

701
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,560
We've been waiting so long to hear you say that, Dr. Legume.

702
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,640
I too, I must say, am so very, very butt hurt.

703
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,220
And I noticed that Osama Bin Laden didn't show up this Ex Day.

704
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,440
He promised.

705
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,680
And everyone thought he was dead, so he thought he could make it here.

706
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,080
Look at these sad faces.

707
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,000
Why do I have to witness this?

708
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,300
Well, they do have a new-

709
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,380
Wait a minute, you didn't see Osama?

710
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,480
No.

711
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,200
I've seen him driving around in a golf cart with Philo!

712
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,700
Well, that figures.

713
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm sure they're coupled up in some bed together.

714
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,760
Them and Saiten.

715
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,580
God almighty.

716
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
Stang stand here.

717
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,780
Hal stand here.

718
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,560
Legume stand here.

719
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,300
Face us.

720
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,280
Everybody face us.

721
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,200
It's hard for us to face anyone now.

722
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,180
This is the first time this has ever happened.

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,860
M.I.D.

724
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,540
What's up?

725
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,780
Shoulder to shoulder.

726
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,620
Tighten up.

727
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,340
Don't know where.

728
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,100
Don't know when.

729
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,160
Yum yum yum.

730
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,380
Alright.

731
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,620
Can you-

732
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,860
It's, uh, it's, it's 7-0-4.

733
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,580
Oh, don't say that!

734
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,880
What happened?

735
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,580
According to some of you.

736
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:43,660
We cannot know the thoughts of aliens, of godlike creatures that could be far greater than we.

737
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,760
Well, I don't mean you personally, Princess We.

738
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,760
But, uh, we do know-

739
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,880
That, uh, this is not 1998.

740
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,340
That is the only thing that we can know.

741
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,700
Bob said the world ends 7 AM July 5th, 1998.

742
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,880
By these stripes, we know that this is not yet 1998.

743
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,040
It's that simple.

744
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,400
Well, it's-

745
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,760
I think-

746
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,460
It's not 8661 either.

747
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,180
And it's not yet-

748
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, it's not 8661.

749
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,400
We, we, we, uh-

750
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,380
And you still haven't made a million dollars.

751
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,440
So we still don't know-

752
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,560
Whether or not he did not fucking-

753
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:20,740
Because this day when all the-

754
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,220
People would die.

755
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,440
I need my slip.

756
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,720
And- and what's there to live for now?

757
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,180
Now I have to spend another year strung out on drugs-

758
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,660
What's that?

759
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Trying to wait for another promise-

760
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,540
You know what would cheer us all up?

761
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,400
What are you doing?

762
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,340
Let's kill the documentary crew!

763
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,120
Hey!

764
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,460
That's an idea!

765
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,720
That's why they didn't come down, you fuckers!

766
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,380
Kill!

767
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,760
We were commercialized out of our promise!

768
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Kill!

769
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,700
We'll destroy the evidence!

770
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:49,880
Kill!

771
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,500
Attack them!

772
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,440
Attack them!

773
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,140
Here's a subgenius related question.

774
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,460
What is keeping the exists from rescuing us?

775
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,060
I'm getting older, uh, help or heap?

776
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,180
Here.

777
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,800
Here.

778
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm getting older here.

779
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,660
I'm getting older over here.

780
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:11,920
What's keeping the exi-

781
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
Am I chopped liver-

782
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,460
Well, uh, what is keeping the exists?

783
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,580
Did anyone remember the movie, um-

784
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,700
What's it called?

785
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,720
This Island Earth?

786
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,800
According to that, there's a flame barrier around the solar system.

787
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,960
Boy, I never knew that.

788
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,780
But that could keep them back.

789
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,480
Look, that's their problem more than ours.

790
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,920
It's a matter of celestial navigation.

791
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,940
It's a matter of operating spaceships.

792
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,860
And spaceship operation is an incredibly complicated business.

793
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,460
Also, the problem of where you get your energy is complicated.

794
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,700
The problem of moving at sidereal speeds and transecting space is a skullbuster.

795
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,660
And one of the major problems is just stopping after you achieve the enormous speed that you need to achieve.

796
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,460
If they're so all fired superior, they've got it worked out.

797
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,760
And so, they'll come in their own good time.

798
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,860
That's, uh, their end.

799
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,200
It's between them and Bob.

800
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,440
And we are only here to, uh, reap whatever reward they want.

801
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,100
And that reward there is.

802
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,400
As Hal pointed out, we may have to do this again next year, friends.

803
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,120
At least we found a nice place to do it.

804
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,500
What?

805
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,940
No, with feeling.

806
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,400
Ten!

807
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,200
Nine!

808
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:32,560
Eight!

809
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,660
Seven!

810
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,620
Six!

811
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,740
Five!

812
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,860
Four!

813
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,840
Three!

814
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,720
Two!

815
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,860
One!

816
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Five!

817
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,780
Four!

818
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,040


819
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Four!

820
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,060


821
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,520
Five!

822
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:47,420
Four!

823
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Six!

824
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,120
Seven!

825
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,360
Eight!

826
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,860
Nine!

827
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,140


828
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,500
One!

829
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,500


830
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,500


831
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,500


832
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,020
Three!

833
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,360
Five!

834
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,280
Six!

835
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,280


836
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,280


837
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:07,420


838
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:07,420


839
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:07,420


840
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:07,420


841
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,340
One!

842
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,340


843
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:08,940
Five!

844
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:08,940


845
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:08,940


846
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,720
Two!

847
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,020
One!

848
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,220


849
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,700
One!

850
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,840
Two!

851
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,040
One!

852
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,840
Time travel through volume.

853
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,260
That's a new one on there.

854
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,280
Well, we should have blew that one.

855
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
That would have been more...

856
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,740
There it is!

857
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,400
I see it!

858
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,360
Oh, never mind.

859
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,980
It falls a lot.

860
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,660
You know, it's funny how often I look around and the people have their cameras pointed

861
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,060
up.

862
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,680
Oh, shit.

863
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,360
They didn't go to Brawl Stars as long as I thought they would.

864
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, no!

865
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,720
They ended up at the festival of Praise Bill, the UFO death cult.

866
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,760
The old flim flam happens every time.

867
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,140
I never planned for anything after this.

868
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,420
I noticed that not everyone is formally dressed as if for church.

869
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

870
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,980
We deserve it.

871
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,960
We deserve to die.

872
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,920
Not to live forever.

873
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,480
I greenwashed them into doing this the very first night.

874
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,820
We did?

875
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,040
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

876
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,160
Meow, meow, meow.

877
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,240
What a nightmare.

878
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,700
Hurting cats.

879
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,220
It's like a recurring nightmare.

880
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,620
Have you ever had this dream before, Susie, where all these people are standing around

881
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,280
staring at you, waiting for you to do some sort of magic trick?

882
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,720
I usually blow them and that's enough.

883
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,160
Well, we all blew them.

884
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
We all blew it this time.

885
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,260
Big time.

886
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,340
Like a dried out Bobby Turner to the bottom of a litter box.

887
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,940
Yeah.

888
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
We did our best.

889
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,840
Once again, maybe that's how we screwed up.

890
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,500
And it wasn't fucking enough, was it?

891
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:12,580
Maybe we should have been more slackful according to somebody else's definition of slack.

892
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,620
I was wondering if this time Bob would really come in and scoop us out.

893
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,580
Maybe we didn't sin enough.

894
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,820
Well, no, that theory has been advanced, that we didn't sin enough.

895
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,020
But then how do you define the sin?

896
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,720
Who among us is without sin?

897
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,580
Yeah, kill him.

898
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,340
Kill him.

899
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:32,960
Lynch him.

900
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,280
Kill him.

901
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,720
Kill him.

902
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,200
Can I just cast a first?

903
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh, no, wait.

904
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,960
Oh, give me a break.

905
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,080
I've seen that guy in a daisy chain in public.

906
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,560
At his wedding.

907
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,880
At his wedding.

908
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,740
I got an excuse.

909
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,340
Yeah, we do all have the excuse, that's for sure.

910
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,720
Every damn one of us.

911
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,560
Including me, so don't look at me that way, kids.

912
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,860
We've already been through this routine.

913
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,380
I'm not J.R. Bob Dobbs and I did not mention the date.

914
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,500
The date was delivered to Bob by Jehovah One.

915
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,540
All the way through the night.

916
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,540


917
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,540


918
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,480
Although I've had several times had our business partner, Jesus, ask me, what the fuck you

919
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,800
idiot came up with 7 a.m.?

920
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,720
Of course, that was a long time ago.

921
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,400
That was in 1953.

922
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,560
When are you going to get a new revelation?

923
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,420
A new revelation?

924
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,180
Yeah.

925
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,300
Oh, I thought you were asking about my shoes.

926
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,780
These are new shoes.

927
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have run up all that credit card debt now.

928
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,960
You're a Mageddon thinker?

929
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,360
Oh, my God, I didn't even think of that.

930
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,540
Because I'm a Mageddon thinker.

931
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,540


932
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,540


933
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,540


934
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,540


935
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,540


936
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,580
I'm a credit card genius.

937
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,020
Oh, God, the old lady.

938
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,040
I shot her legs off.

939
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,260
I kind of blew things up.

940
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,960
Last night I heard sad stories of people who actually have quit their jobs who were experiencing

941
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,720
major anxiety about the outcome of this.

942
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,140
Did you really?

943
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,820
Yes, I did.

944
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,800
Well, we've run into that before.

945
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,000
Did you run into the smile?

946
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,320
That was just before our business dropped off by half.

947
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,540
Well, you know, for all those people who lost their jobs, just remember, whenever Bob opens

948
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,520
a window, someone will wake up without their stare.

949
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:12,520


950
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,020
I'm going to have to go through all of Starwood with the pagans laughing at me again.

951
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,560
You guys didn't get to go home to your jobs.

952
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm saying you were going to ask me why is this morning different than every other morning?

953
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,300
Why Princess, we is this morning different from every other morning?

954
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,320
Why every other morning we wake up and we.

955
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,920
We don't expect to be lifted up.

956
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,300
But this morning we all wake up expecting to be lifted up.

957
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,900
We're still standing here.

958
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,480
It didn't do us a hell of a lot of good.

959
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,300
But by golly, we've all been through a traumatic experience together and and we'll need to

960
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:11,040
to to to stay together as a community to soften the butthurt, to ease the butthurt, to come

961
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,240
back.

962
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,320
We need to get ourselves up in that sore, sore spot and be ready for the next round

963
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:23,960
of butthurt from the discordians laughing at us, all the pagans and most of all the

964
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,440
Christians.

965
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,300
Bob Larson is just going to love this one.

966
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:27,880
I know it.

967
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,620
We need to reenact it properly the next time.

968
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,800
Reenact what?

969
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,440
Why the entire festival without doing it without making the mistake, which somehow we made

970
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,620
here.

971
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:47,140
We have to go over it intensely, go over all the footage, see what or who cleared the pitch

972
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,920
and make appropriate alterations.

973
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,360
It's all his.

974
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,260
No, I thought actually I thought it was all Pisces fault.

975
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,120
She's not here.

976
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,140
Where?

977
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,080
Yeah, where is Pisces?

978
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,440
Yeah, where's Pisces?

979
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,160
It's normal for Pisces to pass out just about 6.59.

980
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,480
That's she.

981
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
Well, she works harder than anyone.

982
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,200
And her faith is greater than just about anyone's.

983
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,140
Well, I'm not going to go looking for blame at this point, but we have a lot of footage,

984
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,480
including some in 3D that we can study.

985
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,600
Dr. Pentagon Weapons Project, a psychologist and neuroscientist, did research on the effects

986
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,480
of electromagnetic radiation on the brain, funded by the Navy and reportedly by the NSA

987
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,020
as well.

988
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,880
Dr. Pentagon perfected a means to make experimental subjects feel that they had been abducted

989
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,420
by aliens.

990
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:45,000
Or had an encounter with angels or God through the use of a modified motorcycle helmet equipped

991
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,320
with solenoids to send electromagnetic pulses through the frontal lobes of the brain.

992
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,780
Human experience of God can be generated by a process that has nothing to do with whether

993
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,920
God exists or not.

994
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:04,060
Dr. God published the paper on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by

995
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,180
electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms.

996
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,240
1995.

997
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,400
Quote.

998
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,660
A process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all

999
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,840
normal human brains to be affected by a subharmonic.

1000
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,640
Random variations of noise within the matrices could potentially differentiate between all

1001
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,400
normal human brains and individual subbrains.

1002
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,820
In other words, individuals could be identified by the specific characteristics of their brain

1003
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,120
output.

1004
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,660
He goes on further.

1005
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,380
Identification of these sequences could also allow direct access to the most complex and

1006
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,380


1007
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,380


1008
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,380


1009
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,220
complex neurocognitive processes associated with the self, human consciousness, and the

1010
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:51,720
aggregate of experimental representations that define the individual

1011
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,800
within the brain.

1012
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:59,400
In other words, a person's memory, consciousness, and sense of self can be fully accessed and

1013
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,360
modified by electromagnetic means.

1014
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,400
Especially a person's personality can be completely shaped, much like the research of Dr. God.

1015
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,380
Dr. God's research on the concept of the brain as a human being is a very complex and complex

1016
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:09,380


1017
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:09,540
process.

1018
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,540


1019
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,540


1020
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,540


1021
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,860
When talking about the brain's structure, we can only do so by more primitive means.

1022
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,600
Dr. Pentagon says the brain processes can be circumvented by direct induction of this

1023
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,840
information within the brain.

1024
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,760
What Dr. Pentagon is saying is that virtually any mental state can be artificially injected

1025
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,440
into a human brain from an exterior source.

1026
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:32,040
The most frightening thing is that the means for doing this already exist in a fully operational

1027
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,020
form on a worldwide basis.

1028
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,220
Quote.

1029
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,380
The power levels for these amplitudes are similar to those essential to the human brain.

1030
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:39,380


1031
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,380
associated with the signals generated globally by

1032
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,340
the subgenius power of sweat.

1033
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,780
Effectively, all consciousness is due to

1034
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,460
electromagnetic patterns generated within the brain.

1035
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,420
What we do is imitate what the brain normally does

1036
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,080
and apply it experimentally.

1037
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,180
Like, you know, where are these thoughts coming from?

1038
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,100
Those thoughts came from the neuroscience laboratory

1039
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,540
at the subgenius power of sweat.

1040
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,240
So friends, if your zippers are still down,

1041
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,100
feel free to go fornicate as if you're very life-dependent on it,

1042
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,240
although at this point it's probably just your slack

1043
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
that depends upon it.

1044
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,840
And spread more.

1045
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,340
We need more little subgeniuses too, by the way.

1046
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,900
That's our form of birth control.

1047
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,920
More subgeniuses, fewer pinks.

1048
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,600
Fuck more.

1049
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,300
Yes.

1050
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,980
Fuck more.

1051
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,760
Well, we're going to do that anyway.

1052
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,520
But I mean, fuck other pinks.

1053
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,460
We're going to do that anyway.

1054
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,460


1055
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,460


1056
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,460


1057
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,460


1058
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,320
In a sexual way, not just in our usual way.

1059
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,880
Ideally, subgeniuses should have children

1060
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,400
with disposable income.

1061
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes, little children with fat wads of cash

1062
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,620
filling their little toddler pockets.

1063
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,620
They can come out and give their $30 to the church

1064
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,740
and buy little tiny t-shirts.

1065
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,100
Suffer the wealthy little children to come unto Bob.

1066
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,320
Suffer the wealthy children to live.

1067
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,100
Well, now even the film is good.

1068
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,040
Look at that.

1069
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,160
They've given up.

1070
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,880
They've given up hope.

1071
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,320
Somewhere over the rainbow

1072
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,060
Way up high

1073
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,480
There's a land that I've heard of

1074
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,680
Once in a lullaby

1075
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,060
Somewhere

1076
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,520
Somewhere over the rainbow

1077
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,120
Skies are blue

1078
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,800
And those dreams that you dare to dream

1079
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,560
Really do come true

1080
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,160
Someday I'll wish upon a star

1081
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,260
Wake up where those clouds are far behind me

1082
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,520
Where troubles are far behind me

1083
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,220
Where bubbles melt like lemon drops

1084
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,460
All the way up on those chimney tops

1085
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:17,480
That's where you'll find me

1086
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,880
Somewhere over the rainbow

1087
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,100
Bluebirds fly

1088
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:36,240
Birds fly over the rainbow

1089
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,240


1090
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,480
Birds fly over the rainbow

1091
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:36,500
Birds fly over the rainbow

1092
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,120
Why then oh why can't I

1093
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,440
If happy little bluebirds fly

1094
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,160
Beyond the rainbow

1095
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:58,400
Why oh why can't I

1096
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,380
Thank you.

1097
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,380
We should be the only ones.

1098
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,380
We should be the only ones.

1099
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,800
You can fall off the back side

1100
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,400
There is a rainbow

1101
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,920
No matter what you do

1102
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:30,920


1103
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,540
Proud to stand on the frozen

1104
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:31,540


1105
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:31,840
At the face of our alkaline

1106
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:31,840


1107
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:31,980
To burn away

1108
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,220
Is our song

1109
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,180
So if you only know how to

1110
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,460
We star to tres

1111
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,320
Stay positive

1112
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,360
Feel free to boot

1113
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:49,160
Let's bring Bob over here and turn him upside down so that his butt is facing the faithful.

1114
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,540
Well, yeah, here we go.

1115
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,760
Poor guy. He's been through so much.

1116
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,380
Here we go now, friends.

1117
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:08,340
You'll notice I've gotten real tired myself of having to be the goat, so to speak.

1118
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,960
Why a goat? Well, you can get their back hooves into your boots.

1119
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,060
They can't run away.

1120
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,900
Yeah, check his pockets first.

1121
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,680
What are in his pockets?

1122
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,240
Oh, there!

1123
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,740
Where's the other walkie-talkie?

1124
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,780
A transmitter!

1125
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,820
He's been speaking to the X's incognito all this time.

1126
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,020
That's not really Bob, Papa Joe. That's a clever robot.

1127
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,760
Maybe he fooled them in thinking, you don't need to come here, I'm already here.

1128
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,320
Let's see what's on the other end.

1129
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,220
Uh-oh. I don't like the looks of this.

1130
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,200
He's left on.

1131
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,540
I can't hear him, but I know it's bad.

1132
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,520
That's why they couldn't find the transmuter signal.

1133
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,360
Well, that proves what they said.

1134
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,500
What do you say about you, Papa Joe?

1135
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:08,220
I've heard that you would crawl through ten miles of broken glass just to hear Bob fart through a walkie-talkie.

1136
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,060
Yeah.

1137
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,820
That's faith, brothers and sisters.

1138
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,980
Yep, there's the butt launching, the prophesied butt launching.

1139
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,440
We couldn't, uh...

1140
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,380
Heads weren't heard enough, but the butts...

1141
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:23,660
Heel butt bad.

1142
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,600
Heel butt good.

1143
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,300
Heel butt good.

1144
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,280
Heel butt bad.

1145
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,180
Well, I'm bleeding butt good in my soul.

1146
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh, I just slapped my microphone.

1147
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,400
Careful there.

1148
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,960
I'm hurt, I have to admit.

1149
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,440
Butt hurt?

1150
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,880
I'm hurt deep in my heart and soul. My faith is hurt again.

1151
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,900
I used the, uh, thank God for that Lutriman spray or everything else would hurt even more.

1152
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,380
Oh.

1153
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,280
But, uh, every day, I'm bleeding.

1154
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Every year we learn something, friends. We learn, we learned, uh, what was the better campground this year.

1155
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:05,680
Absolutely.

1156
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,540
We learned about Lutriman spray powder on a hot day.

1157
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,760
Um, what else have we learned? Let's get something out of this besides more foot...

1158
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,100
...variety of these things.

1159
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,620
Print...Susie the floozy is...

1160
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,060
I'm standing here with my ass in my pockets minding my own business.

1161
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,260
If Bob farts his...if Bob farts his in the ass, we have to ask, what does Bob fart?

1162
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,840
What did we do to deserve this?

1163
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:37,940
If Bob doesn't fuck us in the ass, we have to ask, what am I doing wrong?

1164
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:45,460
Well, maybe we shouldn't even be asking that question. Maybe that's the wrong thing we're doing is asking what we're doing wrong.

1165
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,460
You know?

1166
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,900
We should know what we're doing wrong.

1167
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,980
We're not doing anything wrong. We're doing just what Bob said to do.

1168
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,820
He said that the world would end July 5th, 1998.

1169
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,040
We're doing the best we can to be, you know, in a...

1170
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,220
...slackful situation.

1171
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,440
So we want to reconsider. It could be a problem.

1172
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,600
Yeah, be here now, man.

1173
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,620
We're going to be here now.

1174
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,600
Unfortunately, now wasn't the best time to be here.

1175
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,080
From the perspective when 1998 was a remote date in the future, in the science-fiction future.

1176
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:24,260
Dr. Hal is reminding me of a time back in the 80s when 1998 was 18 years from then.

1177
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,100
Makes sense to me. I'm insane.

1178
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,760
Seven o'clock didn't seem so daunting.

1179
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,100
Twenty years ago.

1180
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:36,240
Twenty years from now you can get up at seven o'clock, sure. So, anyway...

1181
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:43,840
Well, we're all here and they are serving breakfast up there at the cafe.

1182
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,480
Do we have any good advice for subgeniuses to get through the year?

1183
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,760
Do I have any good advice for subgeniuses?

1184
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,580
The same advice that I've been giving for years.

1185
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,040
Don't kill yourself until X day.

1186
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,660
I mean, that's all you have to do.

1187
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,380
All you have to do is stay alive until X day.

1188
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,220
That's the one...

1189
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,780
That and fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1190
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,380
Those two things. Just keep that in mind.

1191
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,880
Stay alive until X day and fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1192
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,160
Wait, I can think of something.

1193
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,220
Whatever you do when you leave X day and get back to the civilian world between now and next X day,

1194
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,700
don't become the star of one of my videos.

1195
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,000
That's true.

1196
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:32,860
True.

1197
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,860
You know, I wouldn't have lived to the X day if it hadn't been for the first of your videos.

1198
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,480
I honestly feel that.

1199
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,180
I was so...

1200
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,840
I was so butt hurt over the butt hurt that only laughing until I...

1201
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,660
Screaming with laughter saved me.

1202
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,780
In fact, Princess Wee and I watching his first Hitler video had to cover our faces with pillows

1203
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:03,000
to keep our guests Potter and petaled nostril from waking up in our guest room.

1204
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:08,940
I woke them up anyway and my pillow was soaked with tears. I laughed so hard I was crying.

1205
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,900
Tears and snot. You make very snot provoking videos Dr. Legaine.

1206
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,700
That's what I go for.

1207
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:24,700
The sad thing was I was looking forward to pinching this loaf on the saucers and now I got to go drop a deuce in the port-a-cats.

1208
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,540
We prefer to call those sweat lodges Susie.

1209
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,920
Shit lodges?

1210
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,220
No, no, sweat lodges not shit lodges.

1211
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,160
They don't smell like sweat.

1212
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,060
The Jenkins.

1213
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,700
I believe I'll have another beer.

1214
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,560
As a matter of fact I was prepared.

1215
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:52,300
One more beer! One more beer! One more beer! One more beer! One more beer! One more beer!

1216
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,600
That's one way of the...

1217
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:06,220
I got up this morning and I got myself a B-R because the future is uncertain and the end is always knee-ar.

1218
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,420
Four more beers! Four more beers! Four more beers!

1219
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,840
Eight more beers!

1220
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:23,240
To the inheritors of the earth, whatever evolves back up to a human-like state,

1221
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,740
advanced enough to be able to play back records like are being done now,

1222
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:36,680
all I can say is it's not too late to buy your eternal salvation from Bob.

1223
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,420
Or triple your money back!

1224
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,400
A matter of hours.

1225
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,960
You will...

1226
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,300
Sure, it's too late for the humans that were left behind.

1227
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:52,560
I'm sure by now you've discovered their burnt skyscrapers and things buried deep under mountains.

1228
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,200
Burnt skyscrapers and things buried deep under mountains.

1229
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,660
The craters left by our ray guns when we escaped.

1230
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:06,280
But Bob will still be somewhere, probably eager to sell you a subgenius membership pack.

1231
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,220
Bob's

1232
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,100
Subgenius Membership Pack

1233
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,520
Subgenius Membership Pack

1234
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,920
Subgenius Membership Pack

1235
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Subgenius Membership Pack

1236
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,800
Thank you for watching!

1237
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,880
Thanks to The Large for that!

1238
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:48,860
This has been hour of slack number 1337 from the church of the subgenius, subgenius.com.

1239
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,900
Which holds the recordings and butchers.

1240
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:58,940
photos and videos of everything. And that is where the broadcast version of the show ended,

1241
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:06,020
so it'll be exactly one hour long, but here on the cuss-filled internet version, we have no

1242
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:13,340
real-time constraints, so I'm going to play precisely nine more extra bonus minutes of the

1243
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:21,620
soundtrack from the semi-edited videotape I was shooting from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. last July 5th of

1244
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:33,920
the year the conspiracy likes to call 2011. Well, I am very, very proud of you subgeniuses,

1245
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,360
despite the fact that we obviously all completely fucked up. We're used to that.

1246
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,160
We can take it.

1247
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:49,220
We can take a joke at least. And the main thing is there's more people here at this 7 a.m. than I

1248
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:57,400
think there have been in any previous years, except that one false 1998. We get more people,

1249
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:06,600
and they're in better shape mentally prepared, I think. I haven't seen anybody shoot themselves

1250
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:13,100
yet like we had that problem with the last few times. There's always some sucker.

1251
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,060
He would just say,

1252
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,080
Three more chants! Three more chants!

1253
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,680
I've seen three more tits.

1254
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,500
Chants.

1255
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,020
Oh, chants.

1256
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,860
Three more chants.

1257
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,420
Three more chants.

1258
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,740
Okay, that's...

1259
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,500
No more chants.

1260
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,480
Three more chants.

1261
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,880
No, that's from the St. Stupid's Day Parade, isn't it?

1262
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,700
I've heard it out here, though.

1263
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,500
You have?

1264
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:33,900
Yeah.

1265
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,860
Oh, it's made its way. No more chanting.

1266
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:37,980
No more chanting.

1267
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,160
No more chanting!

1268
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,180
No more chanting!

1269
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,200
No more chanting!

1270
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,640
That's so old.

1271
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,000
No more chanting!

1272
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,100
We're not gonna protest.

1273
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,980
No more chanting!

1274
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,720
No more chanting!

1275
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,420
Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but for all the girls to take their shirts off.

1276
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,220
Oh, well.

1277
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,560
It's all over with the shitting.

1278
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,520
It's your chance, honeys.

1279
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,860
Suzy, you're taking this a lot better than you usually do.

1280
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,220
I'm drugged.

1281
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,760
Oh.

1282
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,600
No comment.

1283
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,140
She came prepared. Yeah.

1284
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,320
You were ready. You have the emotion dead in your mouth.

1285
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:13,320


1286
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,460
I'm a nurse, just in case.

1287
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,520
Talking about my medication.

1288
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,060
We've been, uh, Suzy and I have been through this many times.

1289
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,040
Too many times.

1290
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,880
A few too many times, yes.

1291
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,040
I'm starting to think you're jinxing me, Sting.

1292
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,920
No, I'm jink-a-ming you.

1293
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,620
But close. Close.

1294
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:35,860
Well, we aren't going to know how close we came, but maybe we're achieving a quorum.

1295
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,580
Maybe if we get just two or three more people next year.

1296
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:39,860
Right.

1297
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:45,860
Maybe if each of you brought a friend next year, we'd achieve the quorum necessary.

1298
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:46,580
A rich friend.

1299
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,340
Actually, a rich friend. A bunch of rich friends.

1300
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:55,100
But yeah, look, if we all had rich friends, how many of us would be here right now? Come on.

1301
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,040
Maybe we're kind of doing the job.

1302
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,720
Oh, I have some really good news.

1303
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,060
This is something not everyone knew happened this year.

1304
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,020
You know those Insight commercials with Smiling Bob?

1305
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,740
Smiling Bob.

1306
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,020
The logo, the fake hard-on pills.

1307
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:09,840
Yeah.

1308
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,880
The C-bows that they made millions of dollars off of ripping people off.

1309
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:23,240
Well, not only did the owner of the company and his poor mom, who's dying of cancer, end up being convicted of fraud,

1310
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:34,200
but the actor who played Smiling Bob disappeared, assumed drowned, off the coast of some Caribbean island.

1311
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,400
I think St. John's.

1312
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,100
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1313
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,060
So at least somewhat.

1314
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:45,280
Although the true subgeniuses did not get ruptured, the fake Bob did.

1315
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,200
I am not going to do it.

1316
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:46,880
Oh my God.

1317
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,160
Yes.

1318
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,880
I know, it was a spiritual thing.

1319
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,840
It wasn't exactly instant karma, but it did catch up with them.

1320
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,040
Yes, it catches up.

1321
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,480
Anyway, the false Bobs all end up the same way.

1322
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,940
Well, but that's the sad thing.

1323
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,780
They always end up on their heads.

1324
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,380
Every single one of us.

1325
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,840
We're all the same in that respect.

1326
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,720
Except that we did spend our 30 bucks.

1327
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,040
And one of these days, it's going to happen.

1328
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:16,520
Bob's lesson, once again, it seems plain to me, is that X-Day could happen at any minute.

1329
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,840
Any second.

1330
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,700
Are you ready?

1331
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,200
Are you ready?

1332
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:28,880
Have you been living either as if you had all the time in the world, or as if this was the last day of your life?

1333
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,860
Either one works fine.

1334
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,320
It's just the in-between stuff that's kind of a waste.

1335
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,020
So remember that.

1336
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,380
X-Day could happen.

1337
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,280
We could just be an hour off.

1338
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,400
That's why we're walking dejectedly.

1339
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:49,300
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

1340
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,200
Fuck him as a dog.

1341
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,120
Is that a countdown that we beat up Stan?

1342
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,080
No, no, no.

1343
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,040
This was where we were supposed to take the poison Kool-Aid.

1344
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,560
But as usual, somebody forgot.

1345
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,900
They were passing out.

1346
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,000
They were passing out.

1347
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:06,640
I saw that.

1348
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,600
They were passing out.

1349
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:07,780
Loud chants.

1350
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,380
Loud chants.

1351
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,280
Loud chants.

1352
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:10,760
No.

1353
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,240
No.

1354
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,160
Enough.

1355
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:17,720
It is true that we should have the, you know, we should have little white things of Kool-Aid to down.

1356
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,960
We don't, usually people don't really drink.

1357
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,800
Look at that.

1358
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:26,480
Reverend Heathen is already dejectedly wandering off into the mist.

1359
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah, we're losing him.

1360
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,420
We're losing him.

1361
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,560
Off to get breakfast, I suppose.

1362
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,260
Susie is stomping off in furious anger.

1363
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,300
At, at, uh, Pisces.

1364
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,240
Yeah, it's her fault.

1365
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:39,660
That's it.

1366
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,660
Maybe he's, uh.

1367
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,300
Yeah, it's Pisces' fault.

1368
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,580
Yeah.

1369
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,820
This is usually when we go, let's go find Philo.

1370
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,260
Or wake up Jesus or whatnot.

1371
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,200
But they aren't here.

1372
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,120
What if they're on the saucers and we're not?

1373
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,600
I would really feel terrible.

1374
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,680
I saw them in the golf cart with Osama bin Laden.

1375
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:57,020
Huh?

1376
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,060
Philo.

1377
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,840
I saw them in the golf cart with Osama bin Laden.

1378
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,180
Oh, that's right.

1379
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,040
With the yellow sun.

1380
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,600
Oh, yeah.

1381
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:09,240
Well, they're probably in Athens at the, that Casanova restaurant having a nice breakfast

1382
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,040
as a free toast or something.

1383
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,200
Pater Nostrum, how was your evening?

1384
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,620
Did you get some sleep?

1385
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,280
No, I took drugs.

1386
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,600
You stayed up all night.

1387
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,160
No, I didn't stay up all night, but I did have my perspective changed.

1388
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,840
Well, you know, the funny thing is Princess Wee and I can't leave.

1389
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:29,960
I know.

1390
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,960
We're doomed to hell.

1391
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,580
We're doomed to hell.

1392
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1393
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1394
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1395
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1396
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1397
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1398
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1399
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:31,580


1400
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,080
We don't want to Strauss.

1401
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,080


1402
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,080


1403
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,420
He just had to stay here and take a picture of you.

1404
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:42,300
cia hee fah hduh friends, youtreジ répond

Gfha, gzha, resto, we hold, in the experts here

1407
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,580
to forget.

1408
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,200
Well, a question.

1409
01:06:59,200 --> 01:06:59,700
F chain alto.

1410
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,240
What is rap.

1411
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,320
Time for us to all wander back

1412
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,420
You've been crowned

1413
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:27,320
About every two minutes

1414
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,060
I woke up with the freight the song in my head

1415
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:34,760
America

1416
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:41,840
So lick my dick and suck on my mother man

1417
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,260
Fuck yeah, what you gonna do when they come for you now?

1418
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,200
Well that sounds real good sounds real tough, but it's sad and

1419
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,380
We're all alone

1420
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,120
together

1421
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:11,880
But hides are a little thicker now that we've gone survived another accident. I've got a third one growing every X day

1422
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,040
Oh, this is just great we were expecting these beautiful

1423
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,520
Saucers and what do we get?

1424
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,740
little six-seater golf carts

1425
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,620
That would have to be filled up with gas

1426
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:42,720
Fire pit Bruce Perry would like to take his chair. Oh, I see

1427
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,240
Okay

1428
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:53,460
Yeah, fuck you if you can't take a joke Bob

1429
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:01,700
I

1430
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,500
Thought a salesman would be Treya

1431
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,280
