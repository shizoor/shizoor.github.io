1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,340
Ah, yes.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,060
Dear friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number 874,

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,700
which, because I'm trying to upgrade my system,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,780
will actually be a rerun of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse number 449,

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,740
which itself was a rerun of Suzy the Floozy's B-Girl War-O-Rama,

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,760
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse number 271 from 1999,

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,180
and yet it seems as if it was recorded yesterday.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,940
So enjoy the work of Reverend Suzy the Floozy

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,740
with this show originally broadcast on beautiful WREK Atlanta.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,980
To praise Bob.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Now let's see, what is our next move?

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,080
May I suggest something, dear?

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,400
Is it something, Powell?

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Exquisitely vile.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,080
Bud.

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,860
Hello?

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,900
Your party's calling.

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,580
Yeah? Who?

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,780
Your party's there.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,860
Oh, put them on.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,580
One moment.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,460
Hello, Adolf. How are you?

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
Oh, that's too bad.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,120
Yes, I know.

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,420
Huh?

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,420
You have a production.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,960
Oh, that is serious.

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,660
There I am.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,480
America, you say?

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,580
America has a production.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
Oh, American production.

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,920
Well, I...

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,220
Oh, Adolf.

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,820
Wait.

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,460
I've got the very thing.

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,580
Guaranteed to keep the stars and stripes waving forever.

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,880
Is that right?

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,380
At half-mast.

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:43,880
What is it?

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,300
Yeah.

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,780
Am I applied?

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
No, it's nothing new.

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,980
Been tried and proved.

44
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,820
Good thing.

45
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh, you remember?

46
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,200
In your own country.

47
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,460
When you first got your start.

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
It must be something you planned like the Stalin's.

49
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
And the proletariat must be a little bit more confident.

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,740
Now relax, Adolf.

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,520
And watch history repeat itself.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,600
Be more clear.

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,240
In a word, my dear.

55
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,260
War.

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,300
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Wide World War.

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm Sonny Todd.

58
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,400
And I'm Bertie Swan.

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
And we're here to bring you all the blood.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,740
All the carnage.

61
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,500
All the raw excitement of mankind's favorite spectator sport.

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

63
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,760
Broadcast right in your living room from hotspots around the world.

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,160
Today, we're going to take a look at a territorial dispute in the Far East.

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,260
A coup d'etat and an unstable military dictatorship.

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,120
And a possible comeback attempt by one of the third world's most popular tyrants.

67
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,600
But first, let's go down to the jungles of Central America where several teams are battling to the wire for a playoff berth in the upcoming 20th Century World Conflict Championship.

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,640
Hello again, everybody.

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,520
Chuck Gazoo here with Danny Don Stegma on a steamy wet afternoon in the tropics.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,620
Trying to keep up with all the action down here in the Western Hemisphere playoffs.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,760
And the race here in the Banana Division is as tight as anyone could walk.

72
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,000
And a tough one to keep track of.

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,900
Right, Danny Don?

74
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,780
That's right, Chuck.

75
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,640
You know, half the time, I'm not even sure which side is the home team.

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
One minute, it's the military regime.

77
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
The next, it's the rebels up in the mountains.

78
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,820
Gosh, if I didn't have a program, I'd never be able to keep up.

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,680
Well, one thing's for certain, Danny Don.

80
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,080
And that is the right-wingers are intent on bringing a winner here to the tiny developing nation of Buenos Noches.

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,100
They've made some important trades in the off-season with the U.S. team and beat up their offensive till now it's ranked second here in the Banana Division.

82
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,860
Right, Chuck.

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,760
And at the same time, we've got to keep in mind that Soviet training and hardware give the leftist guerrilla team a very...

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:24,760


85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:24,760


86
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,840
...very solid look this year, too.

87
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,920
So my bet is we're in for a really interesting conflict this season.

88
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,800
As we get closer to game time, we can see both sides taking up their positions in the jungle, waiting for the starting gun.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,380
The American coaches are waving from the home team bunkers, trying to get the game started.

90
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,060
And a representative from the military government is working with the ushers in the Buenos Noches cheering section,

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
trying to round up some last-minute additions to his team.

92
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,320
The U.S. ambassador is just giving the all-clear signal, so it looks like we're about to get some action in as much a way to play off series.

93
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,740
You know, Chuck, back in 65, when I was a military advisor, I remember we used to go...

94
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


95
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


96
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


97
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,900
We've got a timeout called.

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Apparently, the right-wing team has called timeout to change governments.

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,960
And unanticipated, but not entirely unprecedented action.

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
The U.S. coaches are rushing in to confer with the new dictator.

102
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,060
And the old dictator gets a big hand from the fans as he's escorted off the playing field to be shot.

103
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Very well. Now listen to me carefully.

104
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
The base is being put on condition red.

105
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,280
I want this flashed to all sections immediately.

106
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,880
Condition red, say. That's a very good idea. I'll get some men on their toes.

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Look, Captain, I'm afraid this is not...

108
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,000
This is a very important exercise.

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,020
I want you to transmit plan R, R for Robert, to the wing.

110
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,860
Plan R for Robert.

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,180
Isn't that bad, sir?

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,780
Looks like it's pretty hairy.

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Yes, sir.

114
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,820
Plan R for Robert.

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,540
Now last, and possibly most important, I want all privately owned radios to be immediately impounded.

116
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,520
Yes, sir.

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
They might be used to issue instructions for saboteurs.

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,780
As I've previously arranged, Air Police will have lists of all owners,

119
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,320
and I want every single one of them collected.

120
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,740
Without any...

121
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,240
Exceptional.

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,760
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to a Saturday night at your Clark Officers Club.

123
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,760
You are now listening to the theme of your studio, Pacifico Young and his orchestra,

124
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,100
playing pure youth dancing and listening in fashion,

125
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,380
with the vocal stylings of Sil Castro and Daniel Lopez.

126
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,440
We sincerely hope that you will have a very pleasant evening,

127
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,360
and it's our pleasure to play for you.

128
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,580
Oh, hi there, G.I. Joe.

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,480
Gee, Joe, you look real lonely.

130
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,840
I'll be good girl for you.

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,780
You buy girl drink, Joe?

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,340
Hey, hey, Joe, buy drink?

133
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Buy drink?

134
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,060
Joe?

135
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,220
Wake...

136
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Wake up, Joe.

137
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, I'll be good girl for you, G.I. Joe.

138
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,460
Oh, nice soosie floosie.

139
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,520
Number one boom boom here, Clark Officers Club.

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
We go upstairs now?

141
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,940
Joe?

142
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,260
Joe?

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,800
Hey, Joe, maybe a little oink oink oink oink will wake you up, eh?

144
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,060
Hey?

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,080


146
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,420
Hey?

147
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Hey?

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,420
Hey?

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
Hey?

150
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,900
Hey?

151
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,140
Hey?

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Hey?

153
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:20,980
Hey?

154
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Hey?

155
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,440
Hey?

156
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,440


157
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,440


158
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,900
Hey?

159
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:22,900


160
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:22,900


161
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,760
Hey?

162
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:23,760


163
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,060
Thank you.

164
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,500
Thank you.

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,220
Thank you.

166
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,140
Thank you.

167
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,260
Thank you.

168
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,100
Thank you.

169
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,220
Thank you.

170
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,220
Thank you.

171
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Thank you.

172
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,840
Oh, it's you.

173
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Well, I'm certainly glad

174
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,660
to meet you face to face

175
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,300
because I'm going to put you

176
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,100
you on to a good thing.

177
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,180
You know, we have much to offer here.

178
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,220
Parades, guns, racial superiority,

179
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,380
heel clicking, hile calling, and the joy and glory of slaving

180
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,760
and dying for a Fira.

181
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
Would you like to join up with us?

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I've been intrigued by what you told me.

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,600
I think there's going to be a war.

184
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,820
If there is, you'll have to return to America,

185
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,000
and we may not meet again.

186
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,220
The ladders statement proved to be prophetic.

187
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,240
I went to his office.

188
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,460
All right, you trout-scented, glue-sniffing piles

189
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,420
of fecal matter.

190
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,400
We're looking for some new store managers,

191
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
and I'm told that I have to consider some of you

192
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,500
goat-bred flam factories for the position.

193
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,740
Sir, yes, sir!

194
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,760
What has this sewage stent platoon come to?

195
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,300
Who do they think we are?

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,140
Quick trip?

197
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,400
Sir, no, sir!

198
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,580
They think I'm just going to belly up and respect

199
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,880
my employee that hired and promoted me.

200
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,460
The inside, like some kind of freaking Namby Pamby nursemaid!

201
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,220
I mean, that's no way to run a whale oil machine.

202
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,400
You've got to push your people down.

203
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,880
Never give them an opportunity.

204
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,320
Hire the first person you see, and if they do not live up

205
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,220
to your half-an-odd projections, give them the ODX your seat.

206
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,920
Am I right?

207
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Sir, yes, sir!

208
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,320
Need something else.

209
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,500
This thing turns out to be half as important as I figure

210
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
it just might be.

211
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,480
I'd say that you're all in line for some important,

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,120
important promotions and personal citations when this thing's over with.

213
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,060
You bet your three-day-old multicolored underpants I'm right!

214
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,180
We promote people the old-fashioned way, and that is when, and only when, it will come down

215
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,100
to what, gentlemen?

216
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,520
The lawsuit, sir!

217
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
That's right, you doe-eyed heap of cute baby lamb crap.

218
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,980
I may be your mama, but I'm not here to wipe your nose.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,000
So you will remain private until I say that you can be replaced.

220
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,020
Is that clear?

221
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,940
Good!

222
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,460
I got those up two, three, four occupations.

223
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:49,460


224
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:49,460


225
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,380
I blew.

226
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,860
From my GI to the heels of my GI shoes.

227
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,380
And if I don't go face-side soon, I'm gonna blow my shoes.

228
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,580
I was home on Sky Hill Drive.

229
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,760
Was electronically alive.

230
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,000
But now I'm living in Vandenberg.

231
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,460
I'm home on Sky Hill Drive.

232
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,900
So militarily absurd when things are slow down on the base.

233
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,640
We can shoot tear gas in the dummy's face.

234
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,360
We can stick our balance in the ground.

235
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,980
When the president comes, we'll stand around.

236
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,140
He'll give a dollar for his main line, two dollars for your eyes.

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,500
To pay the price of freedom, oh, it's so real-ized.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,200
These are the voices of infantrymen, medics, mechanics, and MPs.

239
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,360
Fighting men armed with rifles and tanks, airplanes, motorized vehicles and missiles.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,560
But soldiers and airmen unlike any others at any time or any place.

241
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,400
McCormick.

242
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,760
Here.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,460
Hamilton.

244
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,800
Here.

245
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,380
Wigley.

246
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,800
Here.

247
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Nanos.

248
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:07,900
Here.

249
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,820
These are people trained to a fine edge, ever on the ready and able to move into action

250
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,680
at a moment's notice.

251
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,840
But these are people who think of themselves as much more than PFC or tech sergeant or

252
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,240
captain.

253
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,440
They're not just soldiers.

254
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,440


255
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,440


256
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,160
They're men.

257
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,660
Or colonels.

258
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,320
Curlin.

259
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,780
Cedar.

260
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,440
Williams.

261
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Foreman.

262
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,180
DiLorenzo.

263
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,140
Supplyman counselor.

264
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,840
Jackson.

265
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,520
CPA.

266
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,500
Mallory.

267
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,880
Dunning.

268
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,560
Switchman.

269
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,800
Men and women in uniform, in arms, but a unique fighting force, one that marches to a different

270
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,120
limit.

271
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,000
I spoke pot in college.

272
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,740
My grade point average is in the low twos.

273
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,200
My father pulled the strings and gave me international cards.

274
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm a man.

275
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm a man.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,440
I'm a man.

277
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,440


278
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,440


279
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,440


280
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,020
Where do you start with the men of the national guard?

281
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,320
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march.

282
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,840
March!

283
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,880
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march.

284
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,200
March!

285
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,500
And they don't give a perp a heart for a full-fledged march.

286
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,600
Where have you been?

287
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't you know the difference between a standard and a low?

288
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,440


289
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,740
It's the same thing.

290
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,740


291
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,740


292
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,740


293
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:29,460
Our people have always had flags to symbolize the tribes as we marched, and they didn't

294
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,140
worship it.

295
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,120
And the eagle, that's symbolic also.

296
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,200
My name happens to be Arnold, and that means eagle.

297
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,000
I collect eagles.

298
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,300
I don't worship them.

299
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,020
I love eagles, so when I go out into the deserts and watch them fly and put on some of the best

300
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,420
aerial shows that any pilot would have ever seen, I'll keep them in my hand.

301
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,700
that could ever warrant witness.

302
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,320
They're fantastic.

303
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,500
Just, um, you're, um,

304
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,460
you're thinking as just off-center

305
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,520
about that far-fetched.

306
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,240
We're still trying to figure out

307
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,360
the meaning of that last letter.

308
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,520
There's nothing to figure out, General Turgeon.

309
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,980
This man is obviously a psychotic.

310
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
He's not going to hold off

311
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,220
driving on a thing like that

312
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,420
until all the facts are out.

313
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,000
I got the hook, the loop, the tree,

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,120
the hook, the passion, G.I. Blues.

315
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,200
G.I. Blues.

316
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,620
G.I. Blues.

317
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,600
From my G.I. to the heels of my G.I. shoes.

318
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,360
G.I. shoes.

319
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,960
G.I. Blues.

320
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,160
And if I don't go straight side,

321
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
son, I'm going to give up you.

322
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,400
Who has seen the face of war?

323
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,800
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas.

324
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,060
Who has carried the banners there?

325
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Florida, Georgia, and Delaware.

326
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,460
Who made the links that formed the chain?

327
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,880
South Dakota, Indiana, Maine,

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,940
where brave men made their stand.

329
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,960
Kentucky, North Dakota, Maryland.

330
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,660
Who shouted loud?

331
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,040
Gun.

332
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,840
Gun.

333
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,840
Explosions.

334
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm at World War II in Germany

335
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,260
watching everybody fight.

336
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,580
A rocket just exploded my brother Doug

337
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,740
and that sound you heard

338
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,420
was the sound of phlegm in his throat

339
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,460
leaving his mouth

340
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,600
after he was blown away.

341
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:18,820
It was like a rocket that was blown up.

342
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,020
There's the machine gun.

343
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,740
Oh, a minefield.

344
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,540
Give me another sound hose, Hed.

345
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:25,740
Okay.

346
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,420
Make the sound of an F-4

347
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,100
doing a belly flip at 30,000 feet.

348
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,320
Okay.

349
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,600
And don't forget the Doppler effect.

350
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,100
You see it before you hear it.

351
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,560
That's right.

352
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,620
Here it comes with a victory roll.

353
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,240
Got it?

354
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay.

355
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,600
Okay, here it comes.

356
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,620
Okay, for those of you

357
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,900
who closed your eyes during that,

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,620
you missed seeing the F-4

359
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,520
before you heard it.

360
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,960
And also,

361
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,180
Hosehead over there

362
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,640
did the victory roll with his hand.

363
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,700
Who's supposed to see that on an album,

364
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,860
you dim twit?

365
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,840
You can't fight in here.

366
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
This is a war room.

367
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes?

368
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,260
Yes.

369
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh, take it easy, Adol.

370
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,940
Take it easy.

371
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,300
I did all right for you in your own country, didn't I?

372
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,380
Fascism wasn't built in a day.

373
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,660
These Americans are stubborn people.

374
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,520
They like what they've got

375
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,540
and they're going to hold on to it.

376
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,560
There are always a few weak ones.

377
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,540
Stupid, greedy, half-pint souls.

378
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
Those are the ones I'm going to work on.

379
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
Cheer up, my friend.

380
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,340
You know, it takes only one bad apple

381
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,520
to spoil the whole barrel.

382
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

383
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,180
G.I. Joe.

384
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,240
G.I. Joe, wake up, Joe.

385
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,460
Joe.

386
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,360
You see the wallet?

387
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,600
Joe, wake up.

388
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,340
Joe.

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Uh, Carminia, how are you?

390
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,000
Nice to see you boys here.

391
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,980
Nice to see you.

392
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Got all those nice people.

393
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm just fine, thank you.

394
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,220
How are you?

395
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,320
These girls are with the Carminian ship.

396
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,900
Is the ship here?

397
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,460
Maybe here some day.

398
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

399
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,480
You know, ha, ha, ha, ha.

400
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

401
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,320
Well, I left the Navy, honey.

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,920
My girlfriend was in the Navy.

403
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

404
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,460
But she was disappointed.

405
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,020
She found out a 17-inch Admiral's a two-piece there.

406
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

407
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,500
Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace

408
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,720
from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors.

409
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,420
Arr! Arr! Arr! Arr! Arr! Arr!

410
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,620
We selected a typical sailor

411
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,600
to interview this lady.

412
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,640
Your name, sir?

413
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,840
My name's Jose Jimenez, a typical sailor.

414
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

415
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

416
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,800
And, uh, you, you are an apprentice seaman?

417
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,200
Well, yes, I'm an apprentice seaman now.

418
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,180
But someday I hope to go to Minneapolis

419
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,700
and become something better.

420
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,880
What do you think, Spithys?

421
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
I think women and seamen don't mix.

422
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,840
We know what you think.

423
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,060
I love the Navy!

424
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,980
I was in the Army.

425
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I was a wick.

426
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,520
That's a whack.

427
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:20,860
What up?

428
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,320
Ooh!

429
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,100
I will never forget my first day at the Army camp.

430
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,600
They told me I was supposed to mess with the men.

431
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

432
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,920
I love that.

433
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,860
Five days later, I found I was supposed to eat with them.

434
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,220
Have you seen the captain's mess?

435
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,280
Yes, I saw her.

436
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

437
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,840
Oh, yes.

438
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,860
Oh, come on, Jose.

439
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,280
That's a very old joke.

440
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,800
That's the captain's problem.

441
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

442
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,800
Let's continue.

443
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,600
I understand that after this,

444
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,460
after an extended cruise,

445
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,120
a crew can get pretty rowdy.

446
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,780
Oh, yes.

447
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,740
You know, one time,

448
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,380
we went on a cruise for a whole year, you know,

449
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,160
and you should have seen them.

450
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,460
The whole crew got drunk,

451
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,860
and they run around kissing ladies and everything.

452
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,620
Well, that's...

453
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,080
I think that's understandable.

454
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,300
The second day out?

455
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

456
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,100
You don't mean to tell me

457
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,000
that they had women and liquor aboard a ship.

458
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,540
No, I didn't mean to tell you that.

459
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, boy, am I in trouble with the boys now.

460
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

461
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,460
Once we got into slavery,

462
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,260
beazoos.

463
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,340
When I say that,

464
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,380
you guys don't think they would say,

465
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,280
they wouldn't say,

466
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think the wind got into my boat.

467
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,240


468
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,240


469
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,560
I saw anything like that.

470
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,640
It was Ukrainian-American,

471
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,640


472
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,640


473
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,100
Oh, this was before the war begins.

474
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,340
Oh, look at the

475
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,340


476
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,780
Now we're going to try to

477
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


478
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,640
And it's been a while,

479
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,160
young women in women.

480
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,160


481
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,160


482
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,160


483
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,860
You want a short- crucifix?

484
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:47,860


485
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:47,900
A short crucifix.

486
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,000
Un famili blockchain,

487
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,220
the system needs to be

488
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,220
Now, classification in the Navy is where they let you pick out what they want you to be.

489
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,460
I say, I want to be a cook.

490
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,700
And the guy goes, oh man, you don't want to be a cook.

491
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,840
I go, oh, you know, I was still pretty much at the hip again.

492
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm like, oh, what do I want to be?

493
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,380
He said, well, he said, you don't want to be a cook.

494
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
What you want to be is a hospital corpsman.

495
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,040
I went, oh, well, I mean, what do they do, you know?

496
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,280
He says, they hand out drugs and hang around nurses.

497
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,360
And I went, oh, man.

498
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,720
Oh, sign me up, man.

499
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,220
I mean, I was right down my alley, you know, doping women for pay.

500
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,860
Far out, you know.

501
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,040
I always did like a man in a uniform.

502
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,120
That one fits you grand.

503
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,260
Us clubs are bad.

504
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm sorry.

505
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,900
I'm home every evening.

506
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah, but I'm busy every evening.

507
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,500
Busy?

508
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,120
What are you trying to do, insulting?

509
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,580
Why, no, no, not at all.

510
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,780
I'm just busy, that's all.

511
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,060
Come up, I'll tell your fortune.

512
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
Give him a hair of the log that fits him.

513
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,080
Give him a hair of the log that fits him.

514
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
Give him a hair of the log that fits him.

515
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,980
Burl high in the morning.

516
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,640
Burl high in the morning.

517
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,340
That's what we do with a drunken sailor.

518
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,680
Burl high in the morning.

519
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,120
Hey, baby, what did you sign up for?

520
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,180
I said, oh, man, I got a deal, man.

521
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,860
I'm going to be a high school corpsman.

522
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,400
And this guy went, you dummy.

523
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,700
Your commie has no regard for human life, not even his own.

524
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,660
And for this reason, men, I want to impress upon you the need for extreme watchfulness.

525
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,040
The enemy may come individually, or he may come in strength.

526
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,340
He may even come in the uniform of our own troops.

527
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,200
But however he comes, we must stop him.

528
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,920
We must not allow him to gain entrance to this base.

529
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,460
This is your attack profile.

530
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,540
Ensure that the enemy cannot monitor voice transmission or plant false transmission.

531
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,860
The CRM114 is to be switched into all the receiver circuits.

532
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,640
The emergency is to be called in.

533
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,640


534
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,640


535
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,460
The base code prefix is to be set on the dials of the CRM.

536
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
This will block any transmission other than those preceded by code prefix.

537
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,040
Stand by to set code prefix.

538
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,920
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

539
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,600
Set code prefix.

540
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,720
They will not reach their targets for at least another hour.

541
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,520
I am... I am positive, Dimitri.

542
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,880
Listen, I've been all over this with your ambassador. It is not a trick.

543
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,480
Josh, the only difference between peace and war is where we place our bombs.

544
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,780
Flash.

545
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,560
The entire staff of the Pentagon was slipped LSD early this afternoon.

546
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,400
They took off all their clothes and marched to Florida to surrender to the Seminoles.

547
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,600
Let's do it. Now. Today.

548
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,300
What do you say?

549
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,160
All right!

550
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,800
Invasion!

551
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,880
This is good.

552
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,620
It's so good.

553
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,560
Oh, God, it's good.

554
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,620
Ooh! Helicopters!

555
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,240
Ooh! Air strikes!

556
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,300
Ooh! Do it! Do it!

557
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,180
It's good.

558
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,900
It's so good.

559
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,220
It's so good.

560
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Oh, God.

561
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
Huh? Huh? Huh?

562
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,220
Can we do it to someone else? Huh? Huh?

563
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,420
Oh, please, God, can we do it to someone else? Huh? Can we, please?

564
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,880
What do you say?

565
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,760
All right!

566
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,900
Invasion!

567
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,720
All right!

568
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,040


569
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,200
All right!

570
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:36,820


571
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:36,820


572
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:36,860
Invasion!

573
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,720
All right!

574
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:39,700


575
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,060
Thank you.

576
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,860
Let me be proud.

577
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,080
I shut down the street.

578
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,380
Hey! Everybody!

579
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,100
Let's spread good freedom!

580
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,260
Let's spread it thick.

581
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,320
What do you say? What do you say? Hey, dummies, wake up! Wake up!

582
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,360
Joe? G.I. Joe, you wake up now!

583
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,320
Oh, hi, Joe. G.I., you don't look so good.

584
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,140
Hey, maybe a little insect surf is what you need, yeah?

585
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,460
A song like me, Gally? Oh, that's a trick, Joe.

586
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,180
Just don't make a career out of it.

590
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:34,420
That's a group of Marines and British Marines and Air Force and Navy and Army personnel

591
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,920
that were entrapped, so-called, at the Choson Reservoir

592
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,280
when 120,000 Chinese were turned loose on us

593
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,280
and we were a number of about 14,000 and we had to fight our way out.

594
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,360
Get your hands off me.

595
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,360
Out of here.

596
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Who was there?

597
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,240
Here, take this 9mm to that boy.

598
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,320
This man is obviously at site cutting.

599
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,260
My boys, we've got three engines out.

600
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,120
We've got more holes in us than a horse trader's mule.

601
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,160
The radio is gone and we're leaking fuel.

602
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,500
We're flying in lower while we need sleigh bells on this thing.

603
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,060
But we've got one little budge on here, Bruce.

604
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,820
This height, why, they might harpoon us,

605
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,780
but they dang sure ain't gonna spot us on no radar screen.

606
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,480
We're gonna have to tell the police.

607
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,480


608
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,480


609
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,480


610
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,480


611
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,940
He said war was too important to be left to the generals.

612
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,500
When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.

613
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,600
But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.

614
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,240
They have neither the time, the training,

615
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,760
nor the inclination for strategic thought.

616
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,140
I can no longer sit back and allow

617
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,100
communist infiltration,

618
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,260
communist indoctrination,

619
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
communist subversion,

620
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,200
and the international communist conspiracy

621
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,480
to sap and impurify

622
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,200
all of our precious bodily fluids.

623
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,880
And the first thing they look for,

624
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,720
this is the most important,

625
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,660
is his urination pattern,

626
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,920
says your little Tommy.

627
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,260
What do you mean?

628
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,700
If he is given the opportunity

629
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,620
to urinate on a pole or a fence,

630
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,080
but he still squats,

631
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,200
it shows immaturity

632
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,920
and is therefore unacceptable.

633
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,460
So, you know, if they get a squatter,

634
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,720
they just wash him right out.

635
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,540
If they lift that leg up there

636
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,740
and let fly, he's a born killer.

637
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,700
Oh, wow.

638
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,900
What else do they look for?

639
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,560
I don't know.

640
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't care.

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,400
Imagine the poor soldier, though,

642
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,540
who gets that kind of duty.

643
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
Weird, strange place.

644
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,260
We had a guy that got ate by a tiger.

645
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,100
That is not something

646
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,880
that I am conditioned

647
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,900
through going through public high school

648
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,260
in the United States to handle.

649
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,040
Hey, Charlie got ate by a tiger.

650
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
Oh, man.

651
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,920
What am I doing here?

652
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,300
Where are the broads and dope?

653
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,000
I need them now, you know?

654
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,000
I got the one, two, three, four

655
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,900
Occupation G.I. Blue

656
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
G.I. Blue

657
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,140
From the G.I. head

658
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,240
To the heels of my G.I. shoe

659
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,100
G.I. shoe

660
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,640
G.I. Blue

661
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,740
And if a dog goes down the road

662
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm gonna blow my fuse

663
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,680
Occupation G.I. Blue

664
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,920
Occupation G.I. Blue

665
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,060
Occupation G.I. Blue

666
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,220
Oh, buddy.

667
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,440
Oh!

668
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,320
On the fire, just kneeling,

669
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm as lying very still

670
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,980
As I'm to never hold a child

671
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,920
Because a bullet running wild

672
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,460
Has struck him down

673
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,960
And now he cries,

674
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,460
Dear God, oh, why, oh, why?

675
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,640
But who will answer?

676
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,700
An unofficial study

677
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,960
Which we undertook of this eventuality

678
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,460
Indicated that we would destroy

679
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,180
Ninety percent of their nuclear capabilities

680
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,920
We would therefore prevail

681
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,800
And suffer only modest

682
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
And acceptable civilian casualties

683
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,680
From the remaining force

684
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,300
Which would be badly damaged

685
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,400
And uncoordinated

686
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
the Operation

687
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,580
The second Lieutenant,

688
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,420
Fresh from the point

689
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,500
he didn't know

690
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,720
A closed cigarette from a joint

691
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,280
He said,

692
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,740
Hey, man, let's take the hit

693
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,040
They put a bullet in his back

694
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,660
They didn't wanna die

695
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,280
Step up and take a look

696
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
At his eyes

697
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,800
And it wasn't

698
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,620
Bad day for the good guys.

699
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,720
Sergeant Major from World War II said,

700
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,840
Hey, boys, I'll witness for you.

701
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,120
Turn off that music and shine them boots.

702
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,040
They threw a grenade in his tent.

703
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,600
It didn't explode.

704
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,100
Step up close, take a look in his eyes.

705
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,800
It wasn't.

706
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,640
Bad day for the good guys.

707
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,340
Chopper pilot said, we're going to stitch some Kong.

708
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,080
They flew up the delta.

709
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,680
They were gone too long.

710
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,080
They saw some black pajamas that were running from the noise.

711
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,960
The chopper exploded.

712
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,860
It was a curse for the boys.

713
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,120
Step up close, take a look in their eyes.

714
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,780
It wasn't.

715
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,560
Bad day for the good guys.

716
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,960
He got back to the States, fell in love too fast.

717
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,340
Got married, got angry, it just didn't last.

718
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,700
She said, sorry, John, I just can't stay.

719
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
He got a gun and room.

720
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,180
So she's doing today.

721
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,760
Step up close, take a look in their eyes.

722
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,540
It was a bad day for the good guys.

723
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,400
Step up close, take a look in their eyes.

724
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,120
Bad day for the good guys.

725
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Bad day for the good guys.

726
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,400
Bad day for the good guys.

727
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
Blake, get up

728
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,520
gentlemen, get up

729
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,780
get your dead ass out of the rack

730
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,400
I want every last

731
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,640
swinging weenie out of the parade ground

732
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,660
in cold, hot, red hours

733
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,460
do you understand me

734
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,520
gentlemen, your hand

735
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,420
is the wire and I

736
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,240
am the Lord

737
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,640
Lord

738
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,780
but it is necessary now to make a choice

739
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,200
to choose between two

740
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,280
admittedly regrettable but nevertheless

741
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,640
distinguishable post-war

742
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,720
environments, one where you got 20 million

743
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,660
people killed and the other where you got 150

744
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,440
million people killed

745
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,540
we're talking about mass murder general, not war

746
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm not

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,500
saying we wouldn't get our hair mustered

748
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,460
but I do say no more

749
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,520
than 10 to 20 million killed

750
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,920
Tom

751
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,600
on a poster announcing his forthcoming speech

752
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,980
this was written across the photograph of Robert McNamara

753
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,680
stop me before I kill again

754
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,220
laughs

755
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,700
bobs of students surrounded

756
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,720
state college today

757
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,140
they explained that they were anti-semantic

758
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,760
the tactile unit of the local police mob

759
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,080
forced the students to surrender by late this afternoon

760
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,520
laughs

761
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
I have fans cast rusty coming to you

762
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,640
live from the strategic air command headquarters

763
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,780
in Omaha, here's the nerve center for the

764
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,700
U.S. special defense team, I'm Terry Dunn

765
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
I

766
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,580
am

767
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:38,720
a

768
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:38,980
privileged

769
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,780
soldier

770
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,880
for out

771
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:45,880


772
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,960
privilege

773
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,220
to

774
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,840
experience

775
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,100
such

776
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,140
warm

777
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,600
Why

778
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,580
And see, it's even got a built-in scoreboard,

779
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,600
so I know what all the other teams in the league are doing at all times.

780
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,120
We never miss a play.

781
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,980
Well, it's readily apparent that the owners of this particular team

782
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,240
have spared no expense in putting together a winning combination for the next war.

783
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,960
That's right.

784
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,540
Survival kit contents check.

785
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,200
In them you will find

786
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,040
one .45 caliber automatic,

787
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,180
two boxes of ammunition,

788
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,220
four days concentrated emergency ration,

789
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,460
one drug issue containing antibiotics,

790
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,120
morphine,

791
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,700
vitamin pills,

792
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,160
pep pills,

793
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,880
sleeping pills,

794
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,800
tranquilizer pills,

795
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,760
one miniature combination Russian phrasebook and Bible,

796
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,520
$100 in rubles,

797
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,040
$100 in gold,

798
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,500
nine packs of chewing gum,

799
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,960
one issue of prophylactics,

800
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,340
three lipsticks,

801
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,080
three pair of knives,

802
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,140
and a pair of long stockings.

803
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,220
Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff.

804
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,600
This is TFC Helen Miller of the United States Army Recruiting Corps.

805
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,580
The United States Army is known throughout the world

806
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,340
for the care, training, and handling of its privates.

807
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,960
First Battalion, Fourth Marines Alpha Company

808
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,260
operating three miles south of the DMZ

809
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,040
in the jungle, in the yucky jungle,

810
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,760
in the hot, with a gun that I, with people,

811
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,580
and I'm shooting, and I don't know anybody out there,

812
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,020
and no, I'm not mad at anybody,

813
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,340
I don't know what's going on.

814
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,020
There's some dude in Hanoi, and some dude in Washington go,

815
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,880
go get them boys, you know?

816
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,520
You know?

817
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,520
And some guy going, my fellow Americans,

818
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,040
and you are, I'm not, I'm over here.

819
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,240
I'm in the jungle, I ain't your fellow American, you know?

820
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,580
And, and, and some guy in, in, in, you know, Hanoi go,

821
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
my fellow Vietnamese, you know, and, uh.

822
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,080
All this stuff you heard about America not wanting to fight,

823
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,100
wanting to stay out of the war,

824
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,020
we've a lot of horse down.

825
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,620
Americans traditionally love to fight.

826
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,300
All real Americans love the sting of battle.

827
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,780
Commandos, baby, now, one, two, three, four.

828
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,400
.

829
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,960
.

830
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,760
.

831
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,720
.

832
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,160
.

833
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,220
.

834
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,700
.

835
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:40,820
.

836
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:40,840
.

837
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,140
.

838
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
.

839
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,960
Oh, my God, I'm actually a pity,

840
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,400
of those poor bastards we're going up against.

841
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:57,920
I got, I do.

842
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,800
We're not just going to shoot the bastards.

843
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,640
We're going to cut out their living guts,

844
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,760
and use them to grease the treads of our tanks.

845
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,040
We're going to murder those lousy, hung bastards,

846
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,180
by the bushels.

847
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,280
My boys will give you the best kind of stud,

848
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,440
1400 megatons worth.

849
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,100
And you sure as hell won't stop them now.

850
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,620
So let's get going.

851
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,740
There's no other choice.

852
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,940
God willing, we will prevail.

853
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:32,220
in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through the purity and essence of our natural fluid.

854
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:45,260
Here we are in a nuclear pseudo-semi-partially nuclear war, right?

855
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,920
Now, the thing is, it gets to be a pseudo-semi-private-precious sort of semi-nuclear war

856
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,980
when they use everything they got except the big boom.

857
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,260
They used everything. They had mechanical marvels.

858
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,620
Men put their brains to work and they come up with so many fantastic things,

859
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,320
like things that you step on and bounce up in the air and blow your head off.

860
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,080
Men have these great, fantastic minds, you know?

861
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,000
And they had all of these bombs and stuff.

862
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,600
And one time we got into a firefight.

863
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,760
Well, we got into a firefight several times.

864
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,460
As a matter of fact, I got wounded.

865
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,000
I'll tell you how lucky I am. I got wounded five times.

866
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,420
Here we are. We got into this firefight.

867
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,740
Now, they call it a firefight because that's when everybody's shooting at each other

868
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,200
and they haven't figured out a way that you can calmly say that in newsprint other than firefight.

869
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,100
There are a lot of words that we used and they were not firefight,

870
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,180
but we're down there and everybody's shooting at each other.

871
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,440
You know?

872
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,280
And they called in artillery support.

873
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,480
So, over the...

874
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,220
You hear this...

875
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,500
These shells coming in, you know?

876
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,500
They sound like a train.

877
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,220
Then somebody called airplanes and they had these phantom jets.

878
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
And they dropped this napalm.

879
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,900
You know?

880
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,880
So, the whole general thing is...

881
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,360
I got hit with an arrow.

882
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,860
No kidding.

883
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,340
No kidding, man. I got the scar. It went in right there and it came out right there.

884
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,180
I got pinned to the ground with an arrow, man.

885
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,620
I haven't even got enough class to get hurt, modern.

886
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,120
I'm crawling up this side of this hill on my belly, you know?

887
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,540
Everybody else is shooting. I'm down under the grass going,

888
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,900
Hey, me, babe, you know?

889
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,960
I'm crawling around, I was like,

890
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
Eww, funk, you know?

891
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,340
And I look over and my arm is pinned to the ground with an arrow.

892
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,280
And I look over at this cat next to me, this other Marine Corps sergeant,

893
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,600
and he goes,

894
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,780
Only you, man.

895
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,760
Only you.

896
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,460
The hell with heroes.

897
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,360
For some people, the whole world is a jungle and the only law is survival at any cost.

898
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,720
People like Rod Taylor, who'd already won his wings and his medals and now was out for the cash.

899
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,820
People like Claudia Cardinale, who did what she had to do to stay alive in luxury.

900
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,440
People like Harry Gardino, the corruptors, the fixers.

901
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,600
Who were out for the loot, no matter what the price, in other people's lives.

902
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,400
The hell with heroes.

903
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,280
An explosive story about explosive people.

904
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,280
It's today's story, told in today's language.

905
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,760
The hell with heroes.

906
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,740
The hell with heroes.

907
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,620
What's going on, relationships, you ain't never früh.

908
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:32,620


909
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:32,640
Hey!

910
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,420
Stop it, got to focus.

911
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,420

916
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,540
Of all the ones to choose

917
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,580
The way my luck is going

918
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,160
I always seem to lose

919
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,460
Sailing me to the fighting line

920
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,600
I hope the army don't leave me dead in my grave

921
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,340
Hey, give me a pen

922
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,780
I'll do the paperwork

923
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,860
I'm the top rider king

924
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,440
I'd make a damned clerk

925
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,200
Don't put me on the fighting line

926
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,480
Cause I won't

927
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,880
Give you my life

928
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,120
Just to throw away

929
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,040
They've given me the law

930
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,680
Till they take me away

931
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,820
But there's not enough time

932
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,280
When you want to stay

933
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,460
I'll do the paperwork

934
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,880
Soon it's up to the fighting line

935
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,900
And I'll be waiting and riding

936
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,780
On every day

937
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,780
It's a little too long

938
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,660
To live on borrowed time

939
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Well, having met these talks

940
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,460

Well, we're never done

949
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,360
And we will stay

950
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,640
All through another city

951
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,440
The light will be very heavy

952
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:26,440


953
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:26,640

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,720
No matter what

956
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,040
Just to feel it

In the faces of people

958
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,780
But the police

959
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:28,780

If our firts

Target distance, three miles.

1008
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,660
Roger, three miles.

1009
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,780
Target in sight.

1010
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,920
Oh, wow, look at the fun house here.

1011
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,980
And this looks more like Bob's slack-time bunker with all of these sandbags.

1012
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,040
Oh, gee.

1013
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,500
I guess this means we're at war.

1014
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,860
Yes, Reverend Susie the floozy reporting for duty.

1015
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,840
Ow.

1016
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,500
Oh, judging from my blistered editing finger, one of the Susies has turned in a show.

1017
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,320
Oh, man, I hope she didn't do any embarrassing racial impersonations while I was out.

1018
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,280
Oh, hey, okay, a credits list.

1019
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,600
I guess this is all I have to do tonight.

1020
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,080
Cool.

1021
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,480
Yeah, I could use...

1022
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,400
Okay, tonight we were treated to, in no particular order, damn it,

1023
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,780
the wide world of war was by the Holy Ghost Players, a Christian comedy group.

1024
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,220
Oh, there's a lot of Dr. Strange love, the best war movie ever made,

1025
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,680
and one of the worst sound jobs ever in media, second only to my show here.

1026
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:28,620
And that was P.I. and his orchestra at the Clark Air Force Base Officers Club.

1027
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,480
Oh.

1028
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,700
A little oingo boingo.

1029
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,180
A quick trip training video with a weird boot camp thing.

1030
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,800
G.I. Blues with Elvis.

1031
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,120
Oh, poor Elvis.

1032
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,880
Oh, then there's a National Guard promo album with David Jansen,

1033
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,320
Bonnie Anderson, the poor man's Rusty Warren.

1034
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,180
Oh, the Merchant Marine Glee Club did the Drunken Sailor song.

1035
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,220
And then we had hippie Satanist junkie Christian comedy star Mike Warren,

1036
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,520
and he on looking for dope and tail and knob.

1037
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,040
Oh, and then we had Ruby 3's Invasion.

1038
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,380
Ooh.

1039
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,420
And then the insect surfers at Mig Alley from a limited rough mix tape I've had for years.

1040
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,460
Oh, and Arnold Murray raving as per usual.

1041
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,920
The Pajama Slave Dancers, excellent take on who will answer.

1042
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,600
Bad Day for the Good Guys was by Mr. Gasoline.

1043
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,740
And peppered in there were some comedy bits from Congress of Wonders,

1044
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,120
and...

1045
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,460
some Doug and Bob McKenzie was in there too.

1046
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:39,900
And then George C. Scott's bits from Patton were collecting with his bits from Dr. Strangelove for a moment,

1047
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,160
kind of colliding into each other.

1048
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:48,040
And then they veered off to take in Commando, a live version by the angry Samoans.

1049
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:53,600
And then we heard the fighting line by John Mayall and Ballad for a Soldier by Leon Russell.

1050
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,580
Oh, where am I?

1051
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,420
Oh, yes.

1052
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,020
War.

1053
00:54:59,500 --> 00:54:59,760
War.

1054
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,840
Somehow I always heard that the W was silent.

1055
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,100
Yeah, but I'm kind of familiar with it.

1056
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,260
I don't know much from the politics of this particular fight,

1057
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,860
but to a weird little girl growing up in the out-of-touch Midwest,

1058
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:24,140
the televised Vietnam War made for some totally surreal psychic wallpaper.

1059
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,480
But all I got out of it was that it seemed to be a horrifically romantic,

1060
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,060
raw deal for everybody concerned.

1061
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,220
Except, of course, for the fat cats in the military-industrial complex.

1062
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,900
Oh, as big-time hawk Barry Goldwater gushed,

1063
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,680
Thank God for the military-industrial complex.

1064
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Yeah, it seems like the sort of totally screwed business venture the conspiracy's God would get into all right.

1065
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,520
Some motto.

1066
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,840
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,340
I do like the Navy slogan better, whatever it was.

1068
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,800
Yeah, there's a fort in every girl.

1069
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,300
Oh, but that was back in the golden final days of armed conflict,

1070
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,120
the glorious Vietnam War era.

1071
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,400
Yes, the war that cost us some of our most beloved stars,

1072
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,280
like the beaver Jerry Mathers and Eddie Haskell,

1073
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,780
and we all know how Elvis died at Da Nang.

1074
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,800
And who can forget the fiery mishap with Joey Heatherton and Bob Hope

1075
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,740
on the overloaded Huey during the fall of Saigon?

1076
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Oh, but whatever the toll-seekers,

1077
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,980
back then there was still an attainable sense of honor

1078
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,320
that went along with surviving the whole bloody imperilio,

1079
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,600
because the Vietnam War was the last full-contact war.

1080
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,520
Oh, Robert E. Howard's character Conan had a point of view a lot like mine.

1081
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,840
Yes, he thought that fighting technology should end with a sword,

1082
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:08,720
because it was intrinsically noble to face your opponent within arm's reach.

1083
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,180
He considered the bow and arrow to be a colossal leap forward for cowardice.

1084
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,260
And I can only imagine Conan's contempt

1085
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,100
for the high-tech hands-off methods of murder that we have now.

1086
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,400
Oh, but for some nagging reason,

1087
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,820
I just can't get into this new level of...

1088
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,720
warfare either.

1089
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,140
Yeah, like that Twilight of the Gods going on in Yugoslavia right now.

1090
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,300
Oh, yeah, I mean, hey,

1091
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,640
it looks good on paper.

1092
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,040
There are compellingly high body counts,

1093
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,120
and hey, genocide's always good for a plus,

1094
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,780
but somehow the fact that it's a putty-colored electronic war

1095
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,180
and all the new designer colors just leaves me cold.

1096
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,440
Again.

1097
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,720
Hell, this malaise started kicking in back

1098
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,220
during the putty-colored video game Gulf War miniseries.

1099
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,500
I'm really getting bored with it all.

1100
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:11,180
Hey, I brag myself enough right here every day, Bubba,

1101
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,040
without being shipped out somewhere.

1102
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,080
Oh, and look at all the crappy music we've had

1103
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,820
since the Good War stopped in the 60s.

1104
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,080
When the threat of death is apparently what it takes

1105
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,480
to get those creative juices flowing.

1106
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,820
How else can you justify that?

1107
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,760
Why, the crap we lived through in the 70s and 80s

1108
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,140
and the 90s now.

1109
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,180
There's no glory in living through a war

1110
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,520
when it's become something more like

1111
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,100
the equivalent of a bad McJob.

1112
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,660
Besides, who can take war seriously anymore?

1113
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,020
Dodging Spuz missiles is just so...

1114
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,620
so paintball.

1115
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,060
Yeah, like laser tag, but lethal.

1116
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,000
If you're lucky.

1117
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,500
Yeah, otherwise, you're just gonna wind up

1118
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,700
dragging ass through a life wrestling

1119
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,880
with some bothersome service-related condition.

1120
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,740
Ranging from winding up with less

1121
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,340
than the requisite number of limbs

1122
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,840
to getting some sort of flesh-eating

1123
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
radioactive psoriasis.

1124
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,860
Mmm, radioactive psoriasis.

1125
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,440
But in the final consensus, Seekers,

1126
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,800
what's the point?

1127
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,720
What's gonna happen?

1128
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,860
I mean, it's a sucker's bet, kids.

1129
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,000
It's either all gonna blow over

1130
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,080
or it'll all blow up.

1131
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,420
Neither way, it blows.

1132
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,180
Oh, but enough about me.

1133
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,040
And although this has been

1134
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,840
Suzy the Floozy's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

1139
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,340
That's what you're listening to.
