1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Oh, no, yes, it's a test.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,180
Ask to learn.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,740
Side one.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,960
The Alexander Academy presents Mind Engineering.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,100
Instructions of the Alexander Method

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,420
towards a more successful, self-confident, and harmonious life

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,020
through relaxation.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,320
You are about to embark upon a journey that will change your life.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,060
Why do I call it a journey,

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,640
and why do I suggest that it will change your life?

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,460
Let's see.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,760
Life is a journey and not a destination.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
We came from somewhere, and we are going somewhere.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,060
The time between these two points has to be filled.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Dream along with Bozo.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
Dream along with Bozo.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,360
You will find it isn't hard to do.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,300
Because when Bozo comes,

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
there's always room for you.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,300
Right away, Cardozen,

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,240
dreaming is supposing.

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,980
Just suppose you're anything at all.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,920
You can dream that you're an inch or ten feet tall.

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,740
You may decide to be

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,740
on a ship at sea

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,200
or on a bronco in the west.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,640
Whatever you like best.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
Dream along with Bozo.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,800
Dream along with Bozo.

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,520
Anywhere you go, you can't go wrong.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,240
Get on Bozo's happy team and dream along.

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,000
Now you may choose to go

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,140
to a rodeo

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,360
or to a sunny sandy beach.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,900
Nothing is out of reach.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,080
Not when you're with Bozo.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,020
On a tour with Bozo.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,280
Life will be as merry as it is.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,800
There's a song.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,540
So when Bozo goes a-dreaming, dream along.

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,740
Dream along, dream along with Bozo.

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,300
Hehehehe.

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,780
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,100
which reaches from the inner mind to

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,080
the subgenius.

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,140
Hour of Slack.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,740
Coming to a radio near you.

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,200
The greatest program ever heard.

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,580
Just press any afflicted body part against the radio

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,760
and feel the healing power of the fuel injected

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,640
semi-far out subgenius hour of Slack.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,280
Cures fallen arches, impotence, hemorrhoids, bad teeth, terminal conservatism, and boredom.

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,820
Gets a thousand miles to the gallon.

55
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,400
Crashes into freeway supports at 500 miles per hour.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,900
And still comes back for more.

57
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,580
Makes Christine look like a Yugo.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Recharges dead batteries in seconds.

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,520
Diverts tornadoes and sends lightning towards the nearest government building.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,340
Gets rid of wrinkles in everything.

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,220
Turns black and white TVs into color models like that.

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,320
The subgenius hour of Slack

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,160
can turn a tiresome house cat into a lovely set of driving gloves instantly.

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Puts tread back on old tires.

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Mystically rebuilds gummy carburetors.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
Wipes your debts off computer rolls nationwide.

67
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,640
And puts scorpions in the pants of your employers.

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,100
Break the psychic speed limit of your own mind

69
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,460
by tuning into the subgenius hour of Slack.

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,140
With your demonic pit crew boss,

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,080
the high octane river and diving stank.

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,440
Uh, yes, dear friends, oh yeah, I'm supposed to be high octane or something like that.

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,500
And yes, we will be because we've got everything tonight.

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,660
We've got puzzling evidence.

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,620
We've got tons and tons of really, really weird music.

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,720
And we've got rants galore by many new subgeniuses you've never heard of before.

77
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,020
And why it's all coming together somehow, somehow tonight.

78
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,440
And why it's all coming together somehow, somehow tonight.

79
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,320
Load your pipes like the more real thing.

80
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Drop yourselves, be yourselves, or kill me.

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,920
The saucers cannot know what we think.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,800
But they can make us think what they want us to.

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,060
We must be aware.

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,200
We must be what we are.

85
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,240
We must be the subgenius.

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,060
And save ourselves for next day.

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,340
Kill yourselves like the word of Bob.

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,000
He carries the wisdom of the E.T.

89
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,060
Give in to evil!

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,940
Sounds neat! Let's eat!

91
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,020
Come on, Doc. Let's have it.

92
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,660
But the Krell forgot one thing.

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,220
Yes, what?

94
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,760
Monsters, John.

95
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,680
Monsters from the id.

96
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,080
The id?

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,940
What's that?

98
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,380
Talk, Doc.

99
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,220
Monsters from the id.

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,180
The id?

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,800
What's that?

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,360
What's that?

103
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:24,920
The id?

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
I was mr.

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


107
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


109
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


110
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,500


111
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,260
So, you thought you saw some kind of monster?

112
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,400
Well, you know, friends, I mean, this is the 20th century.

113
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,100
We've sent men to the moon.

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,420
There's no such thing as monsters.

115
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Certainly not monsters from the id.

116
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,760
No, we wouldn't be dealing with anything like that tonight, I don't think.

117
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,240
Unless...

118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,100
We always have a hypnotic effect.

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,100
Extremely attractive to people.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,820
I will use a...

121
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:21,880
To...

122
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,020
To...

123
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,520
To...

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,140

Yes, it is really beautiful, really groovy.

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,800
And before that, a nice little mix there by Idioglossia,

180
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,320
or perhaps it's called Idioglossia,

181
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:06,640
by Chris Burke that was sent in to us there by Dad Townsend.

182
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,020
Before that, a little bit of Monster from the Id,

183
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,200
or Monsters from the Id.

184
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,180
We'll be playing bits and pieces of all these things for the rest of the week.

185
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh, what else?

186
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,240
Oh, a little bit of Robobob speaking there, ranting there,

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,180
with the help of Dr. Dinosaur.

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,900
More from him coming up.

189
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,080
And a new subgenius promo up near the beginning by Hellpoke Huey.

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Not to mention Dream Along with Bozo by Larry Harmon.

191
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,660
Thanks to...

192
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Lies.

193
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,140
And, yeah, we've got lots and lots of music of just every...

194
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,260
Huh?

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Huh?

196
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,540
Yeah.

197
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm outwardly calm, apparently normal, quick to smile and slow to peek.

198
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,480
But I have a little quirk, a pattern, so to speak.

199
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,220
I rarely have ever hold a job.

200
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,400
I never finish my work.

201
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,220
I'm an affable kind of a slob.

202
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,200
A highly disorganized, placid sort of a jerk.

203
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,040
I've got the will to fail.

204
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,860
The will to fail.

205
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,620
I have talents that I never use.

206
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,120
I try to win, but I love to lose because I've got the will to fail.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's such a thrill to fail.

208
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,020
A thrill to fail.

209
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,780
I've a backward kind of basic need.

210
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,100
I get my kicks when I don't succeed because I've got the will to fail.

211
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,640
I seem to make an effort, but I never do connect.

212
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:08,200
And while I'm very rational, I'm seldom, if ever, practically never correct.

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,000
Because I've got the will to fail.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,480
The will to fail.

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,240
The will to fail.

216
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,480
The will to fail.

217
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,120
I secretly am enjoying myself.

218
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,020
But slowly I'm destroying myself.

219
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,660
I think I've got a tiger by the tail.

220
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,320
A tiger called the will to fail.

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,720
The Will to Fail

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:35,720


223
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,160
The Will to Fail

224
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,680
The Will to Fail

225
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,320
I seem to make an effort, but I never do connect.

226
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,000
And while I'm very rational, I'm seldom, if ever, practically never correct.

227
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,040
Because I've got the will to fail.

228
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
The Will to Fail

229
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,660
The Will to Fail

230
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,860
Slowly I'm destroying myself.

231
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,460
I think I got a tiger by the tail.

232
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,220
A tiger called the will to fail.

233
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
The Will to Fail.

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,740
The Will to Fail by Katie Lee there, thanks to Dad there in Portland.

235
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,820
But friends, I've got something I need to share with you.

236
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,460
We got this letter in here.

237
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:43,480
Here, information furnished by Dick Weller and the Oregon Citizens Alliance.

238
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,680
Called The Voice They Want Silenced.

239
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,520
And friends, it says here, if I may read from this.

240
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,380
My name is Dick Weller.

241
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:05,940
When I was 17, I was recruited into the Christian lifestyle by an older Christian man.

242
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,280
Like so many young people who get drawn into Christianity, I was lonely and naive.

243
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,620
Eleven years and six churches later, I finally sought help.

244
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,420
Now, I'm normal again and dedicated to helping young people avoid the mistakes I made.

245
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,240
It is true that Christians do not reproduce.

246
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,040
They recruit.

247
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,620
They call it being born again.

248
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,040
The Christians put on a good public image.

249
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
But many Christians try to recruit young people.

250
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,640
Sometimes even going door to door.

251
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,820
The Christians want to put their religious books, such as the Holy Bible, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon,

252
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,740
in school libraries where children can read them.

253
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,420
Some Christians even want children to pray at school.

254
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,620
Or want children to be taught directly from the Book of Genesis in science class.

255
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,940
Sometimes they even pray on school.

256
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,500
Some even make children into school children with free candy and promises that they'll go to heaven.

257
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,280
What the pro-Christian media won't tell you is that Christianity is a behavior.

258
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,140
Simply because they go to church on weekends or refuse to listen to loud rock music,

259
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,740
Christians believe they should be granted special minority status in housing and employment

260
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,040
and have passed many laws protecting them against so-called religious discrimination.

261
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,020
So, I'm going to read this.

262
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,640
Some Christians even want to become teachers.

263
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,100
Religious orientation as a condition or inclination is not comparable to race or ethnic background.

264
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,060
How a person worships or with whom is not the kind of activity for which we should create a minority classification.

265
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:05,500
My Christian friends kept telling me how Christians used to be crucified and fed to lions by religious bigots,

266
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,340
as they called them.

267
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:14,680
But I have since found out that the militant Christians who bomb health clinics and shoot abortion doctors are the real bigots.

268
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,800
It is a known fact that Adolf Hitler was a baptized Christian,

269
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,720
as were many other members of the Nazi party who murdered six million Jews.

270
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,940
The problem with religious freedom is that it never stops there.

271
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,220
If we give these people religious freedom,

272
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,300
what will they want next?

273
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Sexual freedom?

274
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,420
Freedom of speech?

275
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,940
When the government and teachers tell kids that Christianity is just another normal lifestyle,

276
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,780
they're making it easier for adult Christians to recruit them.

277
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,380
I know what I'm talking about.

278
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,220
I was one of those kids.

279
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,380
I'm only one voice against all the pro-Christian bias of the media,

280
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,260
but mine is the voice of experience.

281
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
Sincerely, Dick S. Weller of the Ex-Christians for Truth.

282
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,120
Friends, I just want to tell you, I think that says it all.

283
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,460
I don't know what I could add to that, except for the post office box number of this little flyer that I got that from.

284
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,880
This flyer called, Weapon, because the truth hurts.

285
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,480
It's free from the open eye.

286
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,340
I'm going to give you that address for the open eye.

287
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,620
They're in P.O. Box 1602.

288
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
That's 1602.

289
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,100
Box 1602 in Eugene, Oregon.

290
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,060
That's Eugene, Oregon 97440.

291
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm telling you, friends, I mean, it wasn't long ago that we laughed at the Christians.

292
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,120
You know, some of us even went out Christian bashing.

293
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,340
But you can't get away with that kind of thing anymore.

294
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,040
I know it's not politically correct.

295
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,480
No, sir.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,760
Times have changed.

297
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,880
They've changed indeed, dear friends.

298
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,800
I don't know.

299
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,380
I just don't know.

300
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,400
But I do know this.

301
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,720
I can tell you this much.

302
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,140
I can tell you 50 fun things to do in an elevator.

303
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,520
Number one.

304
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,300
I will be going through this list for several weeks.

305
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,580
I've got several shows to come, I'm sure.

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,520
Number one, friends.

307
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,720
When you're in an elevator with a bunch of folks, you're stuck in there, you've got nothing better to do.

308
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,380
Number one.

309
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,900
Try this.

310
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,700
Make race car noises when anyone gets on or off.

311
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,080
We'll have some more suggestions for 50 things to do in an elevator as we continue with the program.

312
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,840
Thank you.

313
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,260
All right.

314
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,600
We're going to wait.

315
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:06,600


316
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:06,600


317
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:06,600


318
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,680
Brothers and sisters.

319
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,940
Friends of the revolution.

320
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,580
Let me tell you something.

321
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,520
In the beginning, there was pleasure.

322
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,780
And it was good.

323
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,600
And four bars and seven drinks would go and order the former more perfect Las Vegas.

324
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,560
We the weird mushroom goblin army of insanity with one nature that's a Dito.

325
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,300
Do solemnly pledge...

326
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,820
Let me say...

327
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,360
Take the pledge.

328
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,260
Our Pledge of Allegiance.

329
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,280
We'll be right back.

330
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,240
To Tom Jones

331
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,440
Drinking and gambling

332
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,600
To fornication

333
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,540
Hallucination

334
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,020
To visit the holy city at least once a year

335
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,500
Oh, lead us not to Wayne Newton

336
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,100
And deliver us from Michael Bolton

337
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,360
Say it after me now

338
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,320
Say I

339
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,760
Pleasure bearer

340
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,620
To solemnly swear

341
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,680
To go forth

342
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,480
Skip work

343
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,500
Sleep late

344
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,660
And make pleasure

345
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,480
On a planet

346
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,740
I'm a pleasure bearer

347
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,120
Let the drinking begin

348
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

349
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh, baby, it's the ball game

350
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

351
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

352
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah

353
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,360
You can't kill me

354
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,380
I will not die

355
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,860
Not now

356
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,400
Not ever

357
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,900
No, never

358
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,040
No

359
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm gonna live

360
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,180
A long, long time

361
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,660
My soul is gonna die

362
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,220
For his own

363
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,280
Forever

364
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,620
Oh

365
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,700
The time has come

366
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,660
We will not wait

367
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,500
We will storm the gates

368
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,700
At dawn

369
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,820
Out of here

370
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,980
Into the world

371
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,840
Sing a big, big song

372
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,060
Come on, boys

373
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,220
You think if we

374
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,120
But when I die

375
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,320
Not now, not ever, no never

376
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,400
I'm only here for a long, long time

377
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,420
My soul is on forever

378
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,500
Hey, my friend, Johnson!

379
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,120
guitar solo

380
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
I stand alone

381
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,380
And on the road

382
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,700
I know my flesh will rot

383
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,560
But the wind again

384
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,540
And the crazy frame

385
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Whoa!

386
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,840
Not before God

387
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,700
Come on!

388
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,820
You can't kill me

389
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,560
However I die

390
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,420
Not now, not ever, no never

391
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm gonna live

392
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,360
For a long, long time

393
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,180
My soul is on forever

394
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,540
guitar solo

395
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,680
Yeah!

396
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,540
guitar solo

397
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:22,720
Huh!

398
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,240
guitar solo

399
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,440
Hmm!

400
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,080
guitar solo

401
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,300
One more!

402
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,460
guitar solo

403
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah!

404
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,520
guitar solo!

405
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,020
You know, there's people out there

406
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,000
that wanna ban books.

407
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,940
They wanna ban my records.

408
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,660
They wanna tell me when I can drink

409
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,420
and what I can drink.

410
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,280
They wanna ban drugs and sex and everything.

411
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,440
People wanna have a lot of rules.

412
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,880
A lot of rules and regulations.

413
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,600
But listen up.

414
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,620
Listen up, Mr. Rules and Regulations.

415
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,600
I ain't gonna obey!

416
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,660
guitar solo

417
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,680
That's right, man.

418
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,160
I ain't gonna do what you say.

419
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, you can put me in jail.

420
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,200
You can kill me.

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,680
You can execute me.

422
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,560
But you can't kill rock and roll, man.

423
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,060
I'll tell you another damn thing.

424
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,820
I ain't eating no more .

425
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,420
I ain't gonna eat it no more.

426
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,980
I ain't gonna eat it

427
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,800
because it don't taste good.

428
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,980
You know what?

429
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,880
McDonald's can kiss my butt!

430
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,460
guitar solo

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,460
McDonald's can kiss my butt

432
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,020
It's a great big hairy butt

433
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,940
Got a dingleberry hanging off my butt

434
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,660
McDonald's kiss my ass

435
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,900
You know, people say,

436
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,440
Mojo, you're always complaining about everything.

437
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
Why don't you vote in the election?

438
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,460
Why don't you become involved in the electoral process?

439
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,940
Uh-uh.

440
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,980
Oh, yeah.

441
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,120
Vote for Clinton, Mojo.

442
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,020
It's gonna make everything nice and new and neat.

443
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,040
We got one fool just as big a fool as the other fool.

444
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
Ain't nothing changed.

445
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,480
Same fools riding around in the black cars.

446
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,460
We still riding around on the subway.

447
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
Riding around in the bus.

448
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,480
We riding around in a 1978, you know, 1978 El Torino

449
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,420
or some damn thing.

450
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,640
Leaking all.

451
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,880
We ain't got no money.

452
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
Gotta pay taxes.

453
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,420
Everything's screwed up.

454
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,580
I ain't gonna take it no more.

455
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,100
I'm gonna start an armed insurrection.

456
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm gonna go to the hills of West Virginia,

457
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,960
and I'm gonna liberate some guns from a National Guard armory.

458
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,720
And I'm gonna start armed revolt,

459
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,380
because at some time in the course of human events,

460
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,400
it becomes necessary to disassociate yourself

461
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,460
from the ties that bind.

462
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,520
I'm gonna break them ties.

463
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
I'm gonna bust them up.

464
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,400
So there I am standing in the middle of the street,

465
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,020
running around a campfire in the hills of West Virginia,

466
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,900
and the flames are shooting up high.

467
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,620
And I happen to be the head of the armed insurrection,

468
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,340
the Rebel Alliance,

469
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,280
and I'm gonna sing our brand new national anthem

470
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,160
that goes something like this.

471
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,680
You can't kill me.

472
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,520
I will not die.

473
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,760
Not now.

474
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,220
Not ever.

475
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,580
No, never.

476
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,720
Wow.

477
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm gonna live a long, long time.

478
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,380
My soul reigns on forever.

479
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,680
You can't kill me.

480
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,240
I will not die.

481
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
Not now.

482
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,920
Not ever.

483
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,200
No, never.

484
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm gonna live a long, long time.

485
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,620
My soul reigns on forever.

486
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,460
My soul reigns on forever.

487
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,100
My soul reigns on forever.

488
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,180


489
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,640
Forever.

490
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,940
Oh, you can shoot my body full of holes,

491
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,880
but you can't kill the spirit of rock and roll, baby.

492
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

493
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,480

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,700
and I'm not sure where we're going with this show next.

517
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Let's just listen to the beautiful people,

518
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,720
I'll keep you here for a minute.

519
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,560
Gooly, gooly.

520
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,700
Yeah, I tell you, brother.

Gooly, gooly.

Gooly, gooly.

523
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,220
Uh, but dear friends,

524
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,880

525
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
an important lesson, once again, here,

526
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,360
50 fun things to do in an elevator.

527
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,000
Number two,

528
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,760

531
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,400
to the other passengers.

532
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
And number three,

533
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,520
grimace painfully while smacking your forehead

534
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,180
and muttering,

535
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,020
shut up, damn you, all of you, just shut up.

536
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,400
Whistle the first seven notes of,

sway side to side,

543
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,360
at the natural frequency of the elevator.

544
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
Number seven,

545
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,240

praise Bob!

548
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,860
Praise Bob and get you some slack, man!

He carries me on two tight,

He carries me on two tight,

by his tight shall you know him.

553
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,660
By his tight shall you see the world which is to come.

554
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,920
And boy, is it a dandy.

555
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,940
Crazy, very, very, boys.

556
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,880
Crazy for all the beauty girls and boys,

557
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,240
but beware of the conspiracy.

558
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,880
They steal your slack,

559
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,680
and they won't give it back.

560
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,680
We have but one purpose,

561
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
and it remains unknown.

562
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600

567
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,540


568
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,840

569
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,480
Here we go.

570
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,120

577
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,020


578
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,160
Boom,

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,400


582
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,400


583
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,400

oh whoa something else huh friends uh

649
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,000
uh devo of course needless to say a really unusual live album or it's not a live album

650
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,220
actually it's a bootleg is what it is dear friends uh an amazing bootleg tape sent to us by

651
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:44,820
dr scott orsi in calumet city i believe it is and uh yes it's uh from a bootleg live recording

652
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:53,760
recorded in 11 11 82 the uh good bad and the ugly girl you want i guess you could call that

653
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:01,620
and uh well let's go back in time to a little bit of the old puzzling evidence show yes friends

654
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:08,760
it's been a while since i've gotten a proper new tape in from old puzz ev and dr howell and

655
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,500
i've got a couple of them here so well let's just go to it hey

656
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,820
and good evening ladies and gentlemen tonight we give you something entirely new and different

657
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,920
standing beside me is the young man who has declared publicly before a crowd of 15 000 people

658
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,140
and talking over a nationwide radio hookup giving as his reason quote i protest against the state

659
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,680
of civilization end quote you're welcome

660
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,100
and although the opening of the convention is hours off the delegates are already pouring

661
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,480
into the ballpark by the droves with lunch baskets banners and petitions asking not to

662
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,580
jump off any roof but no matter how you look at it it's still a phenomenon

663
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,360
these are the boy for lawyers you've heard people call them have been laughed at and ridiculed but

664
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,480
here they are gay and happy having traveled thousands of miles their expenses paid by

665
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,780
their neighbors who come here to pay homage to their hero and in these days of wars and bombings

666
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,560
it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country an idea based on

667
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,320
friendliness on giving and not taking on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return

668
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,700
and if a thing like this can happen don't let any of your grumbling friends tell you

669
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:23,820
that you're not a hero

670
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,700
that humanity is falling upon jack is you mean you don't feel a certain degree of urgent

671
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,600
pressure on the inner wall of your bladder now right at this moment

672
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,380
letting love go by i'm neglecting your duty to be happy of living on evasion and subterfuge

673
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,820
and resignation

674
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,580
so i have enough half and half for the show man i could have been on the air from midnight

675
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:53,820
to 5 00 a.m midnight to 5 00 a.m i could have done that's a dawn i'm done with the show

676
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,460
the dawn joyce show he has to do that i wouldn't want to do that all the time the way i do shows

677
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,180
because it takes me too much to prepare this that's what stars are made of today and then

678
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,200
we say well then why do you do it oh your state hasn't listened to your show it's weird

679
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,640
yeah i don't recommend that most people listen to it and then we say where's it coming from

680
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,020
no it sounds like it's coming from everywhere i think the sound came up from somewhere down

681
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,800
below up through the ventilation system and exited out of the room and then we go into

682
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:23,800


683
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,120
go through the whole house he probably had another tape recorder stash somewhere i have a feeling

684
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,940
this whole place is rigged to stereo maybe the largest collection of sound effects tapes in the

685
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,680
world i never trust a man whose eyes always meet dead is this some kind of a joke you're talking

686
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,180
to a hologram you better learn this isn't any high school play you're in this is a rat race

00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:23,800


694
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,960
Oh, the sergeant. And if you're going in there, would you mind taking the coffee?

695
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,740
Pleasure. Thank you.

696
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,660
Wait a minute, dog. You need some sleep.

697
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,160
Nothing the black coffee won't cure.

698
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,340
Could I have some of that coffee?

699
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,440

00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,200

707
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,360

708
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020

709
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,340

710
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,520
Hope you got plenty of coffee. I could drink five gallons right now.

711
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,880
Started working for the paper.

712
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,360
Used to...

713
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,600
bring coffee around to everybody.

714
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,800
I hated that.

715
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,100
We can blow her out of the water.

716
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,140
You got some coffee?

717
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:27,940
Yeah.

718
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,260
We should be drinking milk. You know, this stuff is poison.

719
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,080
Hey, tell me. What do you say, huh?

720
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,700
All right.

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,680
Hey.

722
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,360
Would you like some coffee?

723
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,120
No, I hate coffee.

724
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,240
I...

725
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,100
I have one of the... one of the... the...

726
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,900
Chalmestiche. This...

727
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh, I could use some of that.

728
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,600
Black?

729
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,480
Yeah.

730
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,920
Come on.

731
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,080
What's wrong with a hot cup of coffee and a handshake?

732
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,340
You're such a beautiful nursemaid.

733
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,780
Bob, please.

734
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,780
Well, I am pretty much of a bust, I guess, and you're right.

735
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,600
We are kind of an odd combination, but...

736
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,340
even if you don't know it yet,

737
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,500
you need me just as much as I need you.

738
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,080
It's our kind of love,

739
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,680
which makes the world go around.

740
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,340
Rather bumpily sometimes, but...

741
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,520
round it goes.

742
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,260
What was that?

743
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,920
It was the president going by.

744
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
In a blaze of glory.

745
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,800
I wear a...

746
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,280
Lee?

747
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,440
A wealthy man.

748
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,900
Yes, this president has unprecedentedly won this term.

749
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,060
I'm a...

750
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


751
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


752
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


753
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


754
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


755
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,060


756
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,180
Where's Lee?

757
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,200
Where's Lee?

758
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,180
Oh, wrong president.

759
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,220
And I wear...

760
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,120
I press on presidential names.

761
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,740
...for a sacrifice...

762
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,240
Now available from their factory in Yorba Linda.

763
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,660
The original comeback.

764
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
You are getting...

765
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,920
And I want to tell you...

766
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,520
And I want you to tell them...

767
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,160
Make no mistake about that.

768
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,760
And I hope the nation shows...

769
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:49,900
And I hope the nation shows...

770
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,480
...that we are not alone.

771
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,520
As in so many periods of wallowing in water game,

772
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,640
We were consumed almost entirely by a quest for re-emphasization.

773
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,240
...a cause bigger than yourself.

774
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,940
It's the cause of...

775
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,240
What cause?

776
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,920
Just a cause.

777
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,320
...making this the greatest nation in the world.

778
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,380
...the leader of...

779
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,740
Oh, sorry.

780
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,980
...the gods without our...

781
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,340
No matter what its combination of triumphs and tragedies,

782
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,460
any life defined primarily by tenacity must seem at the end a story of some bravery,

783
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,260
but even more melancholy.

784
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,880
It is the end of the world.

785
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,060
In Richard Melhouse Nixon's long march through various valleys of humiliation, dirt, slime,

786
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:33,040
and sleaze, on to political triumph and disgrace and partial rehabilitation, in front of a snickering

787
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,160
nation, there were many episodes of glory, but a constant glimpse and five o'clock shadow.

788
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,140
...strong in our souls, strong in our belief, and strong in our willingness to sacrifice.

789
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,720
You have been willing to sacrifice in a...

790
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh, sorry.

791
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:48,900
...their...

792
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,020
That was the Lincoln Room.

793
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,640
Don't go in there.

794
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:58,980
Yes, thousands have gathered to pay their respects to the deceased president, who we

795
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:05,500
now know was not only our greatest president, but perhaps, in a larger sense, the greatest

796
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,280
human being who ever lived upon this earth, greater even than Jesus Christ, our Lord.

797
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,000
What a guy.

798
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,540
Pure in every detail of his blameless life, and hence, in every detail of his life, he

799
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:18,540


800
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,100
was a handsome and valorous of visage.

801
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,500
The golden being known as Nixon had no flaw known to mortal men.

802
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:33,680
Yea, this Nixon, hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office,

803
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,740
that his virtues plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of Nixon's untimely

804
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,020
death.

805
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,740
For pity, like a naked newborn babe striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim horsed upon

806
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,520
the sightless...

807
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,940
...the most perilous of the air, shall blow Dick Nixon's death in every eye, that tears

808
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,200
and screams shall drown the wind.

809
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,840
I scream for our murdered king.

810
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,440
What else is on, anyway?

811
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,940
Let's see, Dick Nixon dead on Channel 54.

812
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,500
The president dies on Channel 38.

813
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,540
Let's see, the last of the presidents on Channel 22.

814
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,120
Not much on tonight, either.

815
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,200
Not to mention Night of the Living Presidents.

816
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:15,860
Is that on?

817
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah, that's really neat.

818
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,460
It's black and white, and the...

819
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,600
And you've seen Suddenly, haven't you?

820
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,180
Suddenly last summer, Dick Nixon knew.

821
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,740
Yes, in fact, I recommend that Frank Sinatra's version of Nixon in Suddenly.

822
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,120
It's amazing.

823
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,780
Oops, sorry.

824
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,700
That's the Lincoln Room.

825
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,280
Don't go in there.

826
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,620
There was that ghost haunting Dick Nixon.

827
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,180
You can take the Lincoln Room ride now.

828
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,420
Apparently the private White House is a lot more fun than the old government-owned White

829
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,060
House was in the tricky Dixon days.

830
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,760
Twinkie dink.

831
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,440
Yes, everyone remembers that.

832
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,580
I remember those wonderful Trinkie Dink cartoons where you would put a little piece of plastic

833
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:58,780
on the television and interact with the famous 37th president and say, he needs a bridge

834
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,900
built between the Senate and the Appropriations Committee.

835
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,380
So you draw it with the crayon right on the TV screen.

836
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,860
Sometimes dad and mom would get mad when the TV screen was ruined with an indelible mark.

837
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,540
Yes, Trinkie Dick and You was innovative kid games from the 1950s.

838
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,580
Oh, what a party it was down here at Yorba Linda, too.

839
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,500
Oh, it's too violent.

840
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,740
I can never let Billy and Timmy watch the Nixon show.

841
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,620
That man is ruthless and unscrupulous.

842
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,820
Now we're going in the hall of the president.

843
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,820
Oh, yeah.

844
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,840
Well, Antworth has been the chair of the meeting and the table was floored and the minutes

845
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
were read and so forth.

846
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,020
But, you know, the entire procedure was held in town.

847
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,300
Representation of the president like a president.

848
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:47,020
You know, I was wondering, since I'm getting a greater position in this organization and

849
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,420
I'm eventually going to be in the full-time position, if I can get a better position, I'll

850
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,420


851
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,420


852
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,420


853
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,760
probably be in the president position.

854
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:52,760


855
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,860
ombudsman.

856
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,880
All right, Mr. President!

857
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:18,160
44 nicht sind aus ver belli im linderten vor grounds gefeuert.

858
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,400
Iaman, I need fix this.

859
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


860
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


861
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:28,440
A hard-fighting anti-communist, a Cold War warrior who went toe-to-toe with Nikita Khrushchev in the infamous kitchen magician debate.

862
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:39,400
An implacable foe of Cuba, an opponent all his life of civil rights, and finally, the man who left his name upon the moon,

863
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,180
and a black which will endure until the end of time.

864
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,940
Yes, Richard Nixon. Hero or hophead?

865
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,700
Well, we know the answer to that.

866
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:00,060
Well, you know, he did have that giant grocery store glass of whiskey that he carried around as he talked to the pictures of former presidents.

867
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,320
You know, we went and talked to Tricky Dick during those days, and there was no hopping around the White House.

868
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,020
Well, there was, actually, but not by the presidential staff.

869
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,060
Only by the various guards and musicians positioned in the Washington.

870
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,300
D.C. area during this hideous and unidentified war.

871
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:25,240
In three decades, Nixon tasted crisis, mouthed defeat, chewed victory, mumbled ruin, and belched revival.

872
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,800
We have fears in our dreams.

873
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,660
They're ugly.

874
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,860
Something brings them out.

875
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,940
We're all primitive.

876
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,920
We're all primitive.

877
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,160
Deep, deep down.

878
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,840
Evil black eyes.

879
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,620
They're guarding a secret.

880
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,000
Got it?

881
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,420
Got it?

882
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,240
We have fears.

883
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,840
In our dreams.

884
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,620
It's no motion.

885
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,940
Hope the natives are friendly.

886
00:48:48,880 --> 00:49:09,180
��� connect

887
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,720
We live in secret, waiting for the saucers.

888
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,920
On the day they come, we shall see the end and the beginning.

889
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,180
And we shall party town, oh yea, we shall drop blank.

890
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,460
There is no tomorrow, for there will be no tomorrow.

891
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,840
Only the forever to gain, Bob. Praise Bob, praise the time.

892
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,380
He is Bob, eager for fun.

893
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,200
He wears a smile. Everybody run.

894
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,620
Why do you think you're so pink?

895
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,760
Why do you think pink?

896
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,160
Bob is the zero and the one.

897
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,100
Bob is Schrodinger's cat's box.

898
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,160
Why do you fit in traffic jams day after day?

899
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,380
Bob is the middle finger of Wotan.

900
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,480
Bob tunes the fish.

901
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,160
Why do you think the world is run by rampant againsters of antagono schisms?

902
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,300
We're not playing, God.

903
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,940
We're not playing.

904
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,960
This is no game.

905
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,600
Why do you think the savior of most moments is the holy head martyr?

906
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,580
Ignition.

907
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,520
Zero.

908
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,360
We have liftoff.

909
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,260
We have polypropylana.

910
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,820
We have toys.

911
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,060
Why do you think nobody understands the theory of really Rudy too?

912
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,000
Bob is the only dope I need.

913
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,100
Eat me.

914
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,160
Drink me.

915
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,440
Frop me.

916
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,000
Why do you think I've never seen my own thoughts?

917
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,760
You can walk a mile in the devil's hooves.

918
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,560
Why do you think the doctors operate on your head without opening it?

919
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:07,560


920
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,300
Bob can pry you off the ceiling day in and day out.

921
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,460
Why do you think there's no prob with Bob?

922
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,720
I have old eggs.

923
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,980
I have new eggs.

924
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,900
Why do you think the gland has landed?

925
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,500
Kill me, Mr. Sheik.

926
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,860
Why do you think who the hell can say what's to say?

927
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,000
Say what?

928
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,260
I can drive my Bob mobile all the way home.

929
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,480
Why do you think nobody can stop you and nobody can start you?

930
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,400
Give me fresh batteries.

931
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,820
Feed my pura cells.

932
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,720
Why do you think they change wars every few years?

933
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,440
Slack fire will backfire in the faces of those who can't handle it.

934
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,740
Why do you think they end all the news with organized athletic battles?

935
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,640
It's just not civilized to kill it and not eat it.

936
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,540
Why do you think there's a computer on every pink desk?

937
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,240
Is your brain wired into the future?

938
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,440
Who's watching the power meter?

939
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,560
Why do you think there's not saucers in the sky constantly?

940
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,700
Do not open until X-Day.

941
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,700
Blow out all the candles.

942
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,860
Why do you think there's a birth tax?

943
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,840
There's a death tax.

944
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,780
There's a marriage tax.

945
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,840
There's a divorce tax.

946
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,400
You're not even alive if you don't have a license around your neck.

947
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,460
Why do you think that you pay someone to help you spend your money?

948
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,020
Send one dollar to Bob.

949
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,640
Only one.

950
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,500
Only one.

951
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,400
It buys slack.

952
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,500
Why do you think there's not enough work but there's too much food?

953
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,940
Only Bob can win the human race.

954
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,200
He already has the prize.

955
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,080
Why do you think poison is cheaper than food?

956
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,300
Praise Bob.

957
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,920
Praise him, Bob, damn it.

958
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,180
Save yourself.

959
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,980
Where's your life raft?

960
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,680
Why do you think it's cheaper to build people than to build robots?

961
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,460
Are you the whip or the crack?

962
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,180
Why do you think they don't pay you to think?

963
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,220
Bob erases the tapes.

964
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,780
Bob short circuits the shorts.

965
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,840
Why do you think they do everything they can to make you stop thinking?

966
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,720
It's in your genes.

967
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,120
Take it out and wiggle it.

968
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,200
Why do you think they're smarter than you are the harder they make you work?

969
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,560
They're very scary.

970
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,860
Bob is scarier.

971
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,920
It's your only hope.

972
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,080
Why do you think there's a church where there ought to be a think?

973
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,020
Why do you think, Pink?

974
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,780
The person's going to say, I don't have enough time to do the things I'm doing now.

975
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,080
You're going to tell me I've got to catch up inwardly as well?

976
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,420
And that'll give you more time to do the things you're doing now.

977
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,120
And maybe you'll also see some of the things you're doing now aren't quite so important after all.

978
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,660
We just seduced ourselves into thinking they're important.

979
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,680
This is Bob.

980
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,600
Welcome to the bar.

981
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,220
I'm not going to hurt you.

982
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,260
Bob, are you here?

983
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,800
I don't believe in this stupid shit.

984
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,960
Do not try this on your own.

985
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,600
It is extremely dangerous.

986
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,120
So, you want to be an Elder God?

987
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,060
Here at Elder God Tech, our 10-step process can, in just a few short weeks,

988
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,480
transform you into the gibbering, shambling mound of goo that you've always known was your destiny.

989
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,080
Elder God, you're...

990
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,140
Elder Gods are born, not made.

991
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,720
And here at Elder God Tech, we've been making them for thousands of years.

992
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,320
Great Cthulhu himself was not always a titanic, interdimensional being of terror.

993
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,920
He was once Jack Smith, an accountant from Jersey.

994
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,160
There is absolutely no obligation, and the first lesson is free.

995
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,880
In it, you'll study how to respond to chance, how to pronounce your own name,

996
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,460
and you'll get to pick out the features that you want your new body to have.

997
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,900
Our surgical team can transform a 140-pound weakling into a 22,000-pound mutant,

998
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,360
mutating horror with scales, tentacles, gills, suckers, whatever you want.

999
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,740
Now, admittedly, the surgery is not AMA certified,

1000
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,460
but we refuse to allow sadial government regulations to control your new form.

1001
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,960
We promise that, no matter how sick and twisted,

1002
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,900
and no matter how much it costs, we will give you the body of your nightmares.

1003
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,000
And then, in just eight weeks of intensive training,

1004
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,400
we'll teach you all you need to know about recruiting followers,

1005
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,340
creating jade idols, and generating occult smoke.

1006
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,580
You'll attend seminars on temple design,

1007
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,660
and shrine placement,

1008
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,180
and we'll show you where to find the very best in sinking islands and moving mountains.

1009
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,060
We're fully accredited, and we do take transfer students,

1010
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,280
and you'll get so much more besides unlimited power.

1011
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,160
You'll get a network of contacts, other ETT graduates.

1012
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,460
You'll get a place to belong.

1013
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,000
Yes, you'll belong on this planet because you'll own this planet.

1014
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,200
Did you have a junior high bully? Crush him.

1015
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,800
Crush everyone with the same hair color.

1016
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,720
Crush everyone with the same number of vowels in their name.

1017
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,720
It's easy when you know the secret.

1018
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,480
Are you ready that you'll find your new look repellent?

1019
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,140
Hey, beauty is only skin deep,

1020
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,860
and your skin will be up to 30 feet thick.

1021
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,380
Now, you might be worried that some Elder Gods,

1022
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,120
such as our 1803 valedictorian,

1023
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,520
I frequently describe as imbeciles.

1024
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:14,960
Idiots.

1025
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,960
And yes, we do sometimes remove all traces of intelligence from a student,

1026
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,460
but that's just part of the whole gestalt.

1027
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,980
We do not do things halfway here at Elder God Tech.

1028
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,440
A word or two about our competitors might be in order.

1029
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,400
ABC School of Elder Gods, for example, has rotten chanting.

1030
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,720
Simple and direct, those things are an iambic pentameter.

1031
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,120
They only pass along the most obvious and simple-minded secrets of the world.

1032
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,460
The gods, they turn out, can't twist time and space,

1033
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,440
can't turn mortals insane,

1034
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,540
tend to live only about 45 years,

1035
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,640
have no tentacles.

1036
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,640
All in all, friends, it's shoddy.

1037
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,700
At the Acme School, it's even worse.

1038
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,460
The followers they get are absolutely bottom rung.

1039
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,700
No research is necessary to summon an Acme Elder God.

1040
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,260
Any English speaker can wander into the New York Public Library and get the rituals.

1041
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,180
Their names aren't jaw-cracking mouthfuls of consonants,

1042
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,280
and quite frankly, that attracts the laziest minions.

1043
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,260
The sort of secret that they get wouldn't be allowed into any public parks at midnight,

1044
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,340
and no self-respecting domestic animal would deign to be sacrificed by them.

1045
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,080
But here at Elder Gods Academy, you get the full range of benefits.

1046
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,560
You'll live for millennia.

1047
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,820
You'll get to attend the annual convention at Marianas Trish.

1048
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,940
You'll get a 20% discount at affiliated stores,

1049
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:20,240
and if you act now, you'll get absolutely free your own chapter in the upcoming Necronomicon 2,

1050
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,060
The Hallucination.

1051
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,580
Don't you want thousands of alienated little high school losers chanting your name,

1052
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,780
performing your rituals?

1053
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,240
Sure, we all do!

1054
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,340
And we can tell you just how much disdain to show them,

1055
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,340
what gifts to expect,

1056
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,380
and you can be secure in the knowledge that you know how to put on a show

1057
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,180
before you crush their puny souls and suck the marrow from their bones.

1058
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,520
Oh, yes, dear friends,

1059
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,040
and we do know how to put on a show before we suck the marrow from their puny bones.

1060
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,380
Don't we?

1061
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:56,060
Well, that last there was from the good Reverend Paul Montekins at Delphicom Ashley.

1062
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,800
And, yes, so you want to be an Elder God.

1063
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,720
And before that, dear friends, we heard the good Dr. Dynasaur,

1064
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,900
that's spelled D-Y-N-A-S-O-A-R,

1065
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,740
with his tape, Why Do You Think?

1066
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,460
And why do you think, dear friends?

1067
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:27,680
I think it's because Dr. Dynasaur is working with the Yeti Geneti Research Institute,

1068
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,640
home of the Autobob.

1069
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,980
To quote,

1070
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,660
We have all our fingers.

1071
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,180
They're associated with the subgenius church of science fictionology,

1072
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,860
no, science fiction-tology, sorry about that,

1073
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,320
and the clench of the one true pipe dream.

1074
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,280
And, friends, I want to give you some addresses here.

1075
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,940
The number one address, of course, is always

1076
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:54,320
the church of the subgenius foundation headquarters.

1077
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:00,380
Write for free information at this post office box number I'm about to give, won't you please?

1078
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,940
Oh, this is where we have to change music.

1079
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:15,140
Oh, yes, dear friends, just write to Bob at post office box 140306.

1080
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:24,640
Yes, that beautiful post office box, 140306, in lovely Dallas, Texas.

1081
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,220
Oh, yes.

1082
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,380
Zip code 7520.

1083
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,520
75214.

1084
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,220
Uh, yes, and so we come to the end of yet another show,

1085
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,160
the thankful end of another show,

1086
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,600
now to begin yet another show.

1087
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,020
But before we do, let me mention that we also heard in there,

1088
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,680
of course, quite a long stretch of the KPFA Berkeley subgenius show,

1089
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,140
the puzzling evidence show,

1090
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,360
with Dr. Howell, the great Dr. Howell Robbins,

1091
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,600
howling on about President Nixon,

1092
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:08,820
and some more music there from Idioglossia by Chris Burke,

1093
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,400
in a piece called Open the Doors.

1094
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,940
And, yes, we can open the doors, can't we?

1095
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,120
We can open the doors of our brains and our hearts to B-B-B-Bob.

1096
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,120
Oh, good Bob, yes, and the bad Bob as well, because, you know,

1097
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,780
it's the same frontwards or backwards.

1098
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:33,940
B-O-B, man, that's just the way it goes, okay?

1099
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,700
Yeah.
