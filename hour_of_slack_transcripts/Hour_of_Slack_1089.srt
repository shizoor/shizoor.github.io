1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:11,600
How do you do ladies and gentlemen? I'm your host Truman Nedley. If you'll follow me to my demonstration table, you'll see something quite unusual.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,360
Don't forget to take a blood sample at regular intervals.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Everything's ready.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,200
It should hit you fast.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,900
I got my first reaction in about three seconds.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,700
Kind of a roaring sensation like I was in a cave.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,680
You all right, Jim?

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,820
Yes, I'm all right.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,580
But you're not.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,500
What do you mean?

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Something's happened to both of you.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,840
You're moving in slow motion.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,840
Can you see clearly?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,800
Yes.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,380
I'll clap my hands at regular intervals.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,520
Estimate the correct time of the interval.

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,160
I'd estimate the interval to be ten seconds.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,880
Actually, the intervals were only one second.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,360
Oh, the chemicals worn off.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,400
Marken, prepare some more oxynoxine NO2.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,880
And Elaine, help me with the...

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,500
Transformers.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,520
The experiments continued with electric impulses.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,780
Get back, both of you!

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Jazz, you...

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,860
I can't breathe!

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,540
Ha ha, ain't that a laugh?

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,100
What?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Those two can be used for off-stack.

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,100
Two on several rounds.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,960
Full equipment for infecting the meat.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,680
You understand?

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,420
What?

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,100
Exactly.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,860
Shut up!

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,240
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
Uncle Sam.

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,580
Uncle Sam presents...

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,740
The Soul Genius...

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,500
Hour of squawking!

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,840
Wasn't it easy to hug Eve,

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,840


43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,840


44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,840


45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,840


46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,840


47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:25,860
Dubbed pie.

48
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:25,860


49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,380
You may be sitting there right now wondering how you're gonna make it through the day.

50
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,100
Please, have a drink.

51
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,720
Do you worry yourself sick?

52
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,240
Please, let me help you take prescription medication.

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,760
You just take another pill.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,020
This is the real you.

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,320
The man who lost...

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,100
To be very blunt and to the point, I've lost...

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,760
How do you know you can't have slack?

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,380
You are a child of slackness.

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
I have truly lost slack.

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,700
Why do you want so desperately to find slackness now?

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
Can you help me find slack?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,520
A desperate man does anything he thinks might help.

63
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
Has some man got slackness?

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
I knew you'd come.

65
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes, yes.

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,180
I felt the power of slack.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,660
Look at his face.

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
He's smiling and peaceful.

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,900
Yes.

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,140
Now it is here.

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,960
It is my opinion that the people aren't in it.

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,420
It is my opinion that the people aren't in it.

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,300
The Craven Sluck.

74
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,300
The Craven Sluck.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
The Craven Sluck.

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,180
A Poor Man's inflation rule needed to avoid suicide.

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,160
Now I know why this one is so dead.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,940
The Craven Sluck.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,980
The Craven Sluck.

80
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm going to break everything down.

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,080


82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,240
You can't kick me down there.

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,960
Miraculous.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,500
I don't know what to say, but I'm better.

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:46,500


86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,860
I'm going to break down everything into parks, streets, alleys, roads...

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,300
The Craven Sluck.

88
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,300


89
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,280
I was convinced it would sell me some sales, online digital, and then to Meat end stamps...

90
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,620
laid down a set of rules for members of the church to live their lives, and Ms. Smith's life

91
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,280
has met the following criteria. One, she spent her life slacking off and did not conform to the

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,740
expectations of others. Two, she achieved fame and fortune not through hard work or intelligence,

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,560
but basically through dumb holy luck. Three, as seen from her many photos and TV appearances,

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,580
she ate the hell out of her fair share of hamburgers. This meets the definition of the

95
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,720
subgenius commandment, don't just eat that hamburger, eat the hell out of it. Four, she was

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,760
martyred by the pinks, a subgenius term referring to normal people, after being crucified in the

97
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:47,180
press. Five, like Saint Mary Magdalene of the Catholic Church, her child is a son of man,

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,460
we don't mean the band man or man incorporated. Unlike Mary Magdalene, she, who claimed that no

99
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,620
mortal was the father of her child, it seems as though every male and perhaps a few female mortals

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,160
are claiming to be the father of her child. The church uses this as the basis for its prediction

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,880
that Ms. Smith's child shall be a prophet of the subgenius. The Church of the Subgenius encourages

102
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,640
wholesome sexuality, which Ms. Smith...

103
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,120
Ex...

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,200
Ex...

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,720
You'd think I'd be able to say that better.

106
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:30,880
Ms. Smith exuded wholesome sexuality to excess, at least in her prime years. So, friends, in the

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,060
official calendar of subgenius saints, the date of May 1st will be set aside for honoring Ms.

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,540
Anna Nicole Smith. She will share this day with Saint Catherine the Great of Russia, who also had

109
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,000
sainthood bestowed on her posthumously by the Church. The Church of the Subgenius,

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,660
a popular organization, often seen as a parody of religious cults including Scientology, the Raelians, and the Unification Church,

111
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,940
was founded in 1953 by the mysterious figure named J.R. Bob Dobbs, whose smiling pipe-smoking image has been seen worldwide

112
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,880
in clip art, graffiti, tattoos, and rock albums from performers ranging from Devo and George Clinton to Sublime.

113
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,900
A number of celebrities are subgenius ministers, including Talking Heads singer David Byrne, Penn Jillette,

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,140
late science fiction author Robert Anton Wilson, comic book artist Robert Crumb, and B. Wee Herman.

115
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,740
In 2001, the Church offered a formal invitation to Ms. Smith for her to attend its annual End of the World Celebration,

116
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:36,420
X-Day, as a vacation from the stress of her daily life. She is not the first celebrity to be awarded posthumous sainthood in the Church.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:45,680
In 1986, an official subgenius minister ordainment was bestowed upon Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, a scant two weeks,

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:53,880
before his death. In his published autobiography, rock and roll singer Frank Zappa acknowledged his agreement with the Church's ideals,

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,320
though refused to join the organization. A posthumous sainthood was awarded to him by the Church shortly after his passing.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,700
And, friends, all I can say is, Modemak also is a sex god.

121
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,400
Good Lord, we're being attacked by flying saucers from another planet.

122
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,740
I must flee to safety!

123
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,580
Bob.

124
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,980
Bob.

125
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,580
Yes, Bob is coming, friends, because that's what he is. That's what Bob is.

126
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:10,120
Fernanda Dandy Lee Murr did that, and the beginning of the show, and thanks to Mr. Sister for the Kraven Slug,

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,540
and to Nor El Pref, who did the man who lost slack.

128
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,880
Friends, this is Ed.

129
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,660
Tower of Slack, number 1089, the Anna Nicole and Magdalene special.

130
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,820
Coming up, news of the subgenius child custody case, and a list of all future subgenius revivals and festivals.

131
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,500
More Nor El Pref from norelpref.com.

132
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,440
Songs by Glass Madness, Doctors for Bob and G. Gordon Gordon, the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

133
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:45,220
But first, from KPFA, Berkeley, Dr. Philo, Dr. Howe, and puzzling evidence.

134
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,900
And a girl, as they seriously discuss the truth of Bob.

135
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,880
Not every soul believes in Bob.

136
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:03,400
But in his confirmation is he known, as also he is the eternal of the eternal ones, the ancient of the ancient ones, the concealed of the concealed ones.

137
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,060
And in his symbols is he knowable and unknowable.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
Hey, knowable, get those animals in the boat. It's starting to rain.

139
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,260
Hey, knowable, get those animals in the boat. It's starting to rain.

140
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,440
Within his skull exist daily 13,000 myriads of worlds from which draw their experience.

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,720
And by him are upheld.

142
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,780
And by him are upheld.

143
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,140
Now why would my mom care about this stuff?

144
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,960
You know, your mom was onto something.

145
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,520
Enough to send your brother out here.

146
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,300
Yeah, with the BB gun already pointed towards his eye.

147
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,040
With it fixed to a special device.

148
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,580
Right now?

149
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,580
He's coming right now?

150
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,760
It's a hat that he wears and has a BB gun in it pointed towards his eye that only I can pull the trigger off.

151
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,700
Just the drapes and we've got to vacuum the lower hall now.

152
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,720
I want you all to help me.

153
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,260
Before he gets here, we're going to have this house looking spick and span.

154
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,300
And I don't mean maybe.

155
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,380
It doesn't really have to be spick and span.

156
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,860
It just has to look that way, right?

157
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,380
So if we shove this stuff under here, we lift the carpet up over here.

158
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,220
Oh, all right.

159
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,560
Put your crappy old drawers, your skid marked, ridden drawers over here.

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,660
Excuse me.

161
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,180
Ew.

162
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,920
It's my account, Mitch Crimson.

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,680
Man.

165
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,800
You put your foot in it right there in the rear wheel.

166
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,580
Thanks for helping me out of a jam.

167
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,580
I'm glad you liked it.

168
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,860
I appreciate it.

169
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,640
Bye.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,500
Bye.

171
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:06,580


172
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
Bye.

173
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,040
Bye.

174
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,040


175
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,040


176
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,040


177
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,140
Bye.

178
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,700
Bye.

179
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Bye.

180
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
Thank you.

181
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Bye.

182
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,000
Bye.

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


184
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


185
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


186
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


187
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


189
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


191
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


192
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


193
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


195
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:26,760


196
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,260
My grandson's boat Coastal.

197
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,800
He might be demographic already but he's still a great buddy of mine.

198
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:35,800


199
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,840
See ya.

200
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,680
Bye.

201
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:38,680


202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:38,680


203
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:38,680


204
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:38,680


205
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,560
No, you're never gonna make it big

206
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,200
With sound thinking you got problems

207
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,700
Let Bob do the sound thinking for you

208
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,100
Sound thinking by yourself ain't no good

209
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,960
When Bob does the sound thinking for you

210
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,420
Everything you think seems good

211
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,900
Sound thinking ain't not gonna get you to subvenience heaven

212
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,000
Sound thinking ain't gonna help you play this guitar

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,080
Sound thinking ain't gonna help you play this guitar

214
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,980
Sound thinking ain't gonna be the path to Dobbs Town

215
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,300
Sound thinking won't help you grab your car

216
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,360
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

217
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,080
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

218
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,360
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

219
00:14:37,360 --> 00:15:02,020
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

220
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:33,360
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

221
00:15:40,980 --> 00:16:03,780
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

222
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:33,860
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

223
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:57,300
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

224
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,300
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

225
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,060
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

226
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,700
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

227
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,560
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

228
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,560
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

229
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,520
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

230
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,720
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

231
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,720


232
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,720


233
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,720


234
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,920
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

235
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,100
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

236
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,520
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

237
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,820
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

238
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,380
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

239
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,180
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

240
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,560
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

241
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,000
No sound thinking won't get you into a bar

242
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:42,440
court with severe depression. And this means that the state pays for his lawyers. But because the

243
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Bevilacquas each work the equivalent of two jobs each, they have to pay for their lawyers. And they

244
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,640
now have to pay a new different lawyer to handle this higher appellate court thing.

245
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,880
And I could read you a really heartbreaking letter from Reverend Magdalene

246
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,260
about the nightmarish stuff she's gone through. But you can read that letter, as I said, at

247
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:17,380
subgenius.com. If you just click on that big red church emergency link. Maybe I should play

248
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,620
the little radio clip of Bob Larson, the Christian talk show host, talking, well,

249
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
slandering the Bevilacquas.

250
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,860
This is Bob Larson.

251
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,820
Bob Larson with today's Spiritual Freedom Perspective on the subject of the subgenius sect.

252
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:43,800
A strange cult and a custody battle. Now, I've encountered the subgenius cult many times

253
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:51,380
through the years, but I suspect that hardly anybody listening to me now has ever heard of them.

254
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, it is a cult, but it's kind of a parody of a cult.

255
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,860
They call themselves cults.

256
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,680
The church of the subgenius. And they have a god named, interestingly enough, Bob.

257
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,020
This is a kind of a 50s-looking cartoon, single-line-drawn figure smoking a pipe.

258
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,400
And the people who are part of this group, and I've dealt with some of them, and they are really strange,

259
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,320
practice this parody religion through satire, performance, art, and comedy.

260
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,700
And they love to spoof other religious groups.

261
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,860
Not long ago, they held an...

262
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,620
X-Day Festival.

263
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,080
In which they mocked Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of the Christ.

264
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,180
They dressed up Jesus Christ as a clown, carrying a cross, fashioned in the shape of a dollar sign,

265
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:54,140
and as he made his way to Calvary, the members of the church, the subgenius, beat him with,

266
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,860
shall we just say, sexual toys?

267
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,480
Discreetly?

268
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:10,300
Well, it just so happens that Rachel Bevilacqua has had custody of her son since birth.

269
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,120
Now, the father retained visitation rights, but dear old dad became upset at the church of the subgenius

270
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:27,800
and the type of things that his son was being subjected to, so he took steps to request sole custody of the child.

271
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,860
Well, when the judge found out what this cult was all about,

272
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,660
and the strange things that they did,

273
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,720
he removed the child from the care of the mother.

274
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Well, the people in the subgenius sect went on the internet and they went on the march.

275
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,860
And as a result, it looks like there's going to be...

276
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,540
There's going to be a new hearing, and the case has been reassigned to another judge.

277
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,880
And this mother, dear, sweet Rachel of the subgenius sect, is going back into court,

278
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,160
claiming the right to raise her child in that kind of environment, and arguing,

279
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,660
oh, come on, judge, can't you take a joke?

280
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,040
Let me tell you a bit around these people.

281
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,420
They're not only strange, they're full of the devil.

282
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,700
And the sad thing is the justice system.

283
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,500
The justice system is giving this woman a second chance to keep her child

284
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,780
in this kind of demonic cult that would subject the innocency of a youngster

285
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,560
to such perverted goings-on.

286
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,360
It should be plain.

287
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,600
There should be no question.

288
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,720
There is no need for a second hearing, a second trial.

289
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,460
Well, this woman is not fit to be...

290
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,220
a mother.

291
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,540
Anyway, friends, there are numerous ways that you can help with this case.

292
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,120
You know, this thing doesn't just affect subgeniuses.

293
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,160
Basically, anybody who's planning to be a parent, or is a parent now,

294
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,080
who so much as keeps weird artwork in their house,

295
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,000
needs to be aware that a family court judge can take your child away from you

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,860
because he thinks the artwork...

297
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,320
is bad.

298
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,120
And...

299
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,240
So, you know, quit making fun of the Muslims who won't even allow a picture of Muhammad to be made.

300
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,340
The Americans...

301
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,440
are no better.

302
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,580
Or at least, let me put it this way, friends.

303
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Once again, we're fighting the American government because they think it's okay to take children away from

304
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,420
hard-working, well-educated families with a

305
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,180
clean-as-a-whistle record

306
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,260
just because

307
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,600
their artwork has Bob in it.

308
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,360
And we know what that means.

309
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,860
That means they don't believe in the...

310
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,260
uh...

311
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,760
or that...

312
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,020
or that it means they don't necessarily believe in the majority religion of Christianity.

313
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,940
Which...

314
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,280
and no matter what they say, friends, it's still a crime not to be a Christian in the USA, apparently.

315
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,080
You... or you have to be...

316
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,720
you can be a non-Christian, but you have to be the right kind,

317
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,220
according to...

318
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,340
New York family judges.

319
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,540
Uhhhh...

320
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
And, uh...

321
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,820
And so...

322
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,660
God will successfully, with the help of the federal court system,

323
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,780
be mocked in 40 million little innocent pagan babies.

324
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,060
I really believe throwing God out of the...

325
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
the ACLU, People for the American Way,

326
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,440
public square, the schools,

327
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,000
all of them,

328
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,980
the abortionists have got to make that an alternative lifestyle,

329
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,500
secularize America,

330
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,320
and the gays and the lesbians

331
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,700
point the thing in their face and make God bear some burden for this.

332
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
Well, Jerry, that's my feeling.

333
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,480
I think we've just seen the... the antechamber to free society.

334
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,280
We haven't even begun to see what they can do to the major population.

335
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,940
The... the problem is we've adopted that term,

336
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,420
so we're responsible for that agenda at the highest levels of our government.

337
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
I... I totally concur.

338
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,980
A Dr. Larry Chan Show.

339
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,100
Jay Cthulhu did that.

340
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,840
It's called Jerry and Pat.

341
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,400
Before that, Glass Madness did that song, Sound Thinking.

342
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,820
And now, more puzzling Hal and Philo explaining the truth.

343
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,380
Well, my... my, uh, statistics...

344
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,300
my statistics friend who's capable of distorting the truth

345
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,140
once told me that I had extended...

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,500
I had extended the information farther than the data would support.

347
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,700
I'm gonna be dumb.

348
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,860
And why would, uh...

349
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,020
They make such a criticism.

350
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,020
No other reason than sheer jealousy.

351
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes, it was sheer jealousy.

352
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,000
They were envious.

353
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,660
They had been my enemies for a long time.

354
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,480
And I vowed vengeance.

355
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,720
I would be vindicated.

356
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,300
I went back, uh, to them.

357
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,520
And I ran back to their door.

358
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,700
I walked 500 miles to get back there.

359
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,580
Me and the alien...

360
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,940
Actually, two 500 mileses.

361
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,580
Two of them.

362
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,840
But I had the alien walk... That's how you said it.

363
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,260
One of the 500 mileses.

364
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,440
While I just only walked one 500 miles myself with my one leg.

365
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,400
No, God was carrying you, see?

366
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
That's why there was only one set of tracks in the sand.

367
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,260
A godless hairy ape was with me.

368
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,940
That's what was actually with me.

369
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,260
And they called him...

370
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,520
God or God?

371
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,320
...hairy ape.

372
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,100
There was only one set of tracks in the sand.

373
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,080
There was only one leg.

374
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
One set of foot...

375
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,620
There was only one footprint.

376
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,300
There is no...

377
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,120
There's only one tile.

378
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,000
There was only one footprint.

379
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
It was just the left foot.

380
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,380
And it went on and on.

381
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,800
And it was like, how did he do it without jumping?

382
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,380
Was there a pogo stick involved?

383
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,340
Was there a cane?

384
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,800
Was there some kind of levitation device that only worked on half of his body?

385
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:07,800


386
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,420
You are a carbon footprint.

387
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,020
Yeah.

388
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,420
Yeah, that's what it was.

389
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,120
A levitation device that only filled him up on half of his body.

390
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,640
The other half was just normally ambulating along through the sand, walking with Jesus.

391
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,860
Jesus.

392
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,860
The pink Jesus.

393
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,740
Trying to find out what it was.

394
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:26,820
And he was walking with Jesus.

395
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


396
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


397
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


398
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


399
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


400
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


401
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


402
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


403
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


404
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


405
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820


406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,260
You'll never know what it was that made him so special.

407
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,840
No, not him.

408
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,220
Him.

409
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,160
Could not be him.

410
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,600
Him, the pink Jesus.

411
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,300
Leave the sub-genius alone.

412
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,480
Anyway, now, friends, we're going to go to Ex Day now.

413
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,600
Ex Day X now with Nauro Preffiness galore.

414
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

415
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,200
Like myself.

416
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,780
I think you're going to be very interested in this story.

417
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:56,800


418
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,500
that we're going to tell you on a day that we'll call X.

419
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,480
On a certain day called X,

420
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
the sun came up at 6.31.

421
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,440
Children were boiling and coughing late.

422
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,160
Wake up, wake up. It's a wonderful day today.

423
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
Religion is important.

424
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,360
The people, like its church architecture,

425
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
are forward-thinking and shining the pumper.

426
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,720
Booty, booty.

427
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
This day is the one called X.

428
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,080
And so this day called X,

429
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,600
which began in such an ordinary way,

430
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,600
is no ordinary day.

431
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,200
Normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period.

432
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,480
On a day called X.

433
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,960
Ladies and gentlemen, just about there.

434
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,140
I have no information yet as to how it's progressing.

435
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,080
By 10.55.

436
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,400
I have no information yet as to how it's progressing.

437
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,980
Normal broadcasting has been discontinued.

438
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,900
Keep your radio tuned to this frequency.

439
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,120
Follow the green light. Proceed with care.

440
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,780
Move immediately to this...

441
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,420
...dispersal area.

442
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,500
Rumors are everywhere.

443
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,120
According to information we have just received,

444
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,320
the situation remains the same.

445
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,500
Chief Simpson.

446
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,940
He might be interested in knowing that en route,

447
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,620
one boy and twins were born.

448
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,300
There's no panic among the children.

449
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,800
They've rehearsed this before.

450
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,440
I think we're doing quite well.

451
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,200
Project supervised by Will Gibson.

452
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,540
It is time to be alone and think of the future.

453
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,200
Eat, sleep, and breathe on this day called X.

454
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,080
The air outside is strange.

455
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,320
And silent.

456
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,620
The day called X reaches its climax.

457
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,280
The day called X reaches its climax.

458
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,560
What happened after that moment?

459
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,720
We leave you to contemplate.

460
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,500
The one thing is certain.

461
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,000
Normal broadcasting has been discontinued.

462
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,700
Normal broadcasting has been discontinued.

463
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,620
Bob won the Olympic gold medal.

464
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,780
And once again, Bob stood on the top of the world.

465
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:56,780


466
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,800
And once again, Bob stood on the top of the world.

467
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,400
A gold medal!

468
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,360
Let's hear it from the new吗 Lord of the Rings.

469
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,540
I hope you haven't been disappointed.

470
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,980
Are you multiple to right now?

471
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,380
Gibson is the fire in the

472
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,780
sun.

473
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,160
I keep watching the movie because you know,

474
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm reading it live every night.

475
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,660
I'll scar a chance to bring to you

476
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:21,740
what you cannot do in the future.

477
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,820
The bullet charisma the boom among HD...

478
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Do you want to go and

479
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,660
question. You might as well put out a sign and tell people you're a psychic. You just know what's

480
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:37,900
going to happen. Fear and doubt are going to control you. X days. We may also control you.

481
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
As a habit, it's a seed of an idea, a way of life. We are all tattooed in our cradles with the

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,620
beliefs of our tribe. X days. X government. King of the land of ceaseless prattle. With an X days.

483
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,140
You really want this. You believe you deserve it. Your mind has entered a new vibration. I'll

484
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,240
get more into this in a moment. There's a whole big wide world of magnificence out there. There's

485
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,180
a wide world of magnificence in you. Meditate on it. Get emotionally involved with come, come.

486
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,500
You're living in a new vibration. It might even make you laugh. Quit that job. Great. Blah, blah,

487
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,300
blah, blah, blah. This is Bob.

488
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,440
Friends, it's

489
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,600
time for the

490
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:22,600


491
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,120
time for some good news. I'm going to run through a list of subgenius events that are coming up

492
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:36,700
during the next several months and where they're happening at on April 1st in San Francisco,

493
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:43,600
California. And this isn't a joke. It really is going to be on April 1st in San Francisco at City

494
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,240
Lights Bookstore. There will be a devival and sacred subgenius book signing and burning party

495
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,100
with Dr. Philo Drummond,

496
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,180
Dr. Hal Robbins, Puzzling Evidence, Phineas Narco, Reverend John Shirley, Pope Michael Pepe,

497
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,540
and I hope Paul Mavridis signing the new subgenius book, The Bobliographon, and also

498
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:14,080
Revelation X at City Light Books in San Francisco, April 1st. You should be easily able to find City

499
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,520
Lights Books. It's a famous bookstore. May 5th and 6th weekend, text day, friends.

500
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,080
Text day.

501
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,540
X Day, the third one at Dragon's Wild Ranch near Austin, Texas.

502
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,580
Loke E. Coyote puts that on and will be performing there.

503
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm planning to go down there.

504
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,560
And you can find information about this, the addresses, and so forth at subgenius.com

505
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,400
if you click on the events section.

506
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:51,580
And more X Day on May 12th and 18th if you want to jump from Austin to Amsterdam.

507
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,960
Holland.

508
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,400
Euro X Day takes place at various noted clubs, bars, and coffee shops.

509
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:08,620
Friends, you'd have to join the Euro Subgenius mailing list to get the full details on this insane multi-venue life experience.

510
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:18,340
But yes, once again, May 12th through 18th, Euro X Day, where the Euro Subgeni and their American friends who buy a plane ticket

511
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,120
can await the coming of the saucers.

512
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,060
Which actually won't happen.

513
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,680
It won't happen until July 5th, 1998.

514
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,080
Friends, on June 16th, the amino acids, the great amino acids, not heard this time in the background,

515
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,420
but very frequently heard in the background on this show.

516
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:44,300
The amino acids have a CD release and gut blowout party at the Magic Stick in Detroit, Michigan.

517
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,040
To release their new CD, humanity will fall like pins.

518
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,520
Um, so.

519
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,680
Oh, and also playing there will be Easy Action, Fun Ender, and Stylex.

520
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,680
Stylex is a really cool, devoluted sort of a band.

521
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,540
And the amino acids promise their most elaborate staging plans.

522
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,880
Friends, for our listeners in Detroit and around Michigan, that's June 16th at the Magic Stick.

523
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:18,080
And most importantly of all, friends, X Day 10 is coming.

524
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,680
What you might call X Day X.

525
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,660
Date certain.

526
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,200
July 4th through 5th.

527
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,160
I mean 8th.

528
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,040
Well, actually, on the 5th, the world ends.

529
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,740
And the party continues for subgeniuses aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

530
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,860
And this is, friends, the, the subgenius world destruction event.

531
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,780
It happens at Brushwood Campground in Sherman, New York, July 4th through 8th weekend.

532
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
And it's, friends, X Day.

533
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Oh, the prank.

534
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Even if it's just a...

535
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:50,960
A drill.

536
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,920
It's like Gitmo, but in reverse, as Reverend Carter LeBlanc said.

537
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,820
Or as Reverend Just John said, nothing exceeds like exorcists.

538
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,780
And this X Day will feature the bands, the amino acids, Bonobo's Convergence.

539
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,640
There will be a fake UFO evidence hoax contest.

540
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,540
In other words, you know, bring your fake UFOs and take pictures of them or movies or...

541
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:20,800
Whatever.

542
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,980
And create your...

543
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:29,480
The best one will be submitted to all the UFO, you know, studying outlets and so forth.

544
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,620
And TV stations.

545
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,620
And we'll prove that the UFOs at least came, if not the exes.

546
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,540
There will be a subgenius wedding and costume ball.

547
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,460
Actually, it's an Owl My Costume ball.

548
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,700
There will be Dr. Dark's drive-in of bad films.

549
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,620
Dr. Howell will almost certainly be there.

550
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,780
Dr. Philo Drummond and his beautiful, insane new wife, Chaos McBobcat, will be there.

551
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,720
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Mondo Retardo Band with Princess Wee.

552
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,140
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

553
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,600
I just got our first pre-registration from Reverend Eggplant.

554
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,740
So all of the eggplants will be there.

555
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,460
Scientology Horror Tales Roundtable Discussion.

556
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,180
Scrapple Toss Pancake Orgy Liquid Frop Tasting.

557
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,500
And ever so much more, friends.

558
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,620
And at the same campground...

559
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,120
If the world...

560
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,440
You know, if, if, if.

561
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,580
It's all a bunch of big iffy ifs.

562
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,200
Anyway, on July 24th through 29th, Starwood happens.

563
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,380
And Starwood is a huge...

564
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,780
Well, it's actually the largest neo-pagan and multi-weirdo event in the Northeast.

565
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:44,400
And that happens at Brushwood Campground, Sherman, New York, July 24th through 29th.

566
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,100
It includes a subgenius devival and much, much more.

567
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,980
You can read reports on Starwood at...

568
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,080
And you can read a photo novella about last year's X-Day drill at subgenius.com.

569
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,060
Just look for the events section.

570
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,560
And finally, late in the summer, August 17th and 18th, near Syracuse, New York, Burning Star.

571
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,460
Which is a festival inspired by Burning Man and Starwood.

572
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,380
August 17th through 18th, Burning Star.

573
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,060
A really insane festival.

574
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,900
I'll be showing a video barrage there and preaching for two nights.

575
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,160
And there'll be a lot of bands and a lot of pyrotechnics.

576
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,020
And it's like...

577
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,400
It's where the burners go in between burnings.

578
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,880
So, see if you want to know more about any of these things.

579
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,180
Check out www.subgenius.com.

00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,320
Subgenius Beach Party.

583
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,960
Watch what I consume.

584
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


585
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,580
Subgenius Beach Party.

586
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,160

590
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,080
How you were willkommen to broadcast this.

591
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,680
Subgenius Beach Party teleportation YouTube.

592
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,160
You ask whether or not I believe in leprechauns.

593
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,480
To answer this question, let me ask of you.

594
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,120
What?

595
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,500
Leprechauns?

596
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,200
Yeah, little leprechauns.

597
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,360
Even worse, and this is going to stretch it for a lot of folks,

598
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,320
so vampire leprechauns.

599
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,460
Ouch.

600
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,400
The feast of the vampire leprechauns.

601
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm okay.

602
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,980
Oh, all right, sure.

603
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,380
You haven't seen any, like, little guys creeping around with green suits on or anything?

604
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,260
No, and I'm not going to see them until the end of the world, Hal, and you know when that is.

605
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,920
July 5th, 1998.

606
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
Which will come again this year.

607
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,820
Like a strong right arm with six feet.

608
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,340
Three and two testicles, and a giant substance known variously as the dew.

609
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,740
Testify, my brother, testify.

610
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,320
The oil of great goodness, and other terms,

611
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,420
ran down the other parts of this object to be stored in the testicles.

612
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,480
By Texaco.

613
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,600
Technically.

614
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,860
Energy for America's...

615
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,120
Why was it considered so important?

616
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,060
Ouch.

617
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,320
That's hot.

618
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,880
Yeah, that's that band that Stang was talking about that burns the first six rows.

619
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,140
And you get it.

620
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,120
The first two rows are actually blinded, and the rest of the rows get sunburned from the hotness of the band.

621
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,580
Conoco, the most trusted name in petroleum.

622
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,240
Sinclair Dinosaur Energy.

623
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,220
Sinclair Dinosaur Energy.

624
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,980
Sink, sink, sink, sink!

625
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,520
Sink, sink, sink, sink!

626
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
Sink, sink, sink, sink!

627
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Sink, sink, sink.

628
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,560
Once I had a dot com, it big cash.

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,460
It big cash all the time.

630
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,500
Once I had a dot com, now it's gone.

631
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,200
Buddy, can you paradigm?

632
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,520
Sink, sink, sink, sink!

633
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:19,880
Sink, sink, sink, sink!

634
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:19,880


635
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:30,360
Once I had a beaver, it went fast. I did what I wanted to.

636
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:41,620
Once I had a beaver, now it's gone. Buddy, can you paradigm?

637
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:54,780
Paradigm. Once I thought that I was one of the few that was meant to lord over you.

638
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:06,500
God ordained to rule for the rest of my life and all of my children's too.

639
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,480
Once I had a dog.

640
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:19,040
It made cash. It made cash all the time.

641
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:31,020
Once I had a dot com, now it's gone. Buddy, can you paradigm?

642
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,200
It made cash all the time.

643
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,840
Free form. Free. Free. Informative form. Free. Ruin your life.

644
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,320
Uh...

645
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,020
Yes. That's what happened.

646
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,440
In Dallas that day.

647
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,640
Rocked on the...

648
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,100
1960.

649
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,100
Don't forget that thing.

650
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,740
3 November 22nd.

651
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:37,020
On the 33rd parallel, one of the major requirements for the working of the Masonic Order took place.

652
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,000
The sacrifice of the Divine King.

653
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,600
Our Divine King.

654
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,480
John F. Kennedy.

655
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
John F. Spatuti.

656
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,340
And he made little Dallas famous for everything.

657
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,420
Because you go down there and the shack's gone, the sign's gone off the top.

658
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:03,900
And my favorite part is he actually did a little dissolve from 1963 to about, what was it, 19... when was Couch Stock?

659
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,220
I think that's when it...

660
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,920
2002?

661
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,340
Oh, no, no, no. We did it in 1990.

662
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,340
2002 was Couch Stock.

663
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,580
Yeah, it was Couch Stock. Right. We didn't have enough time.

664
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,580


665
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,580


666
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,580


667
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,580


668
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,580


669
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,380
I went down there, actually. You guys went to lunch or something. That was fun.

670
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,160
Out to lunch.

671
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,220
Just how much gristle will you take?

672
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,260
At House O'Grizzle.

673
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,180
Oh, it's so wonderful. When it's all set up and functioning, it makes you proud to be an American.

674
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,660
The show?

675
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,980
Yes, just so.

676
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,720
See?

677
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,220
Yeah, the crowd's just crazy, but I wonder whether it'll be sustained.

678
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,620
This is the... I'm watching the tape with Ask Dr. Howell show this week.

679
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,500
Okay, I see we have another caller. Maybe we had better go to the lines again.

680
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,880
Remember, folks, if you want to know more about the Subgenius Foundation,

681
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,240
if you want to learn things that we inadvertently forgot to tell you over the air,

682
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,280
you can call us again.

683
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,140
We'll definitely get an earful. Okay, we're going back to the phones.

684
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,120
You're on the air with Mr. Opinion on KFJZ.

685
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,420
Yeah, I was... I had a comment for these guys, you know, talking about slack.

686
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,520
Yes.

687
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,000
Mm-hmm.

688
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,180
I was going to give them a little advice, you know, how to obtain a little bit more slack, you know.

689
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,720
Great. We'd appreciate hearing that.

690
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,100
Currently, any one of those guys buying a car?

691
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,800
Funny you should mention that. We're both, since we make so much money on this,

692
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,200
we both bought... have bought new cars in the last month.

693
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,700
Yeah.

694
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:33,900
That's right.

695
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,620
Uh-huh.

696
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,280
Well, I was going to give you a little advice on how to obtain a little bit more slack.

697
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,560
See, all you got to do is, like, miss a couple of payments and better... better give you a little bit more slack, you know.

698
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,220
It'd put you on your feet, wouldn't it?

699
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,380
Right.

700
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,960
Yeah, subgeniuses are procrastinators.

701
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,360
Uh-huh.

702
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,000
I think you've got the right idea. Creative procrastination, especially on Bill Payne.

703
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,960
This man sounds like he might be a subgenius. Do you think he is?

704
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,580
I am picking up strong subgenius vibes here. Sure.

705
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,660
Well, I just wanted to give you that little, you know, a little advice there.

706
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,500
Okay, hang on, and we'll see if we can't figure out what you used to be in a previous lifetime.

707
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh, that's okay. I just wanted to just give you that little advice.

708
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,720
Hey, you robbed a bank in Del Rio in 19, uh, 1901 or something like that.

709
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,560
Oh, is that right?

710
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,240
Yeah, you were in a different country then.

711
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,740
Okay.

712
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:18,840
That's wild.

713
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,680
Okay, well, thanks a lot for calling.

714
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,620
Okay. Bye-bye.

715
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,080
Good night.

716
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,880
Okay, folks, if you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius, just give us a call.

717
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,400
Uh, one of the things that, uh, I was particularly intrigued about...

718
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,920
...was, uh, the fact that you call yourself Reverend Stang.

719
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,500
Uh, are you indeed really a reverend?

720
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,360
I am a, legally a reverend.

721
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,740
I am ordained by three different churches.

722
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,080
Uh, didn't cost me much to do it.

723
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,940
Um, the Universal Life Church and the American Fellowship Church, and another one, I can't even remember their name.

724
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,700
There's a bunch of others.

725
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,540
We'll ordain you as a minister for, like, a couple of bucks.

726
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,120
I'll send you a little card that says you are one, and you are.

727
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,380
Uh, and then for ten or fifteen years...

728
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,660
...and then for fifteen more, you can get a charter through these people's, uh, various churches...

729
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:13,380
...and become a church and get tax-exempt status, where you don't have to pay taxes on the land you buy for the church and that kind of thing.

730
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:13,780
Uh...

731
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,180
The IRS can't touch you.

732
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,300
Right. But in that respect, I am, I'm a reverend through those guys, but I'm not chartered, you know, with them.

733
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,200
Well, I know, I know folks that this is hard to believe, but, uh, they gave me a card when they got here...

734
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,400
...and it says that I am the, uh, Right Reverend Mr. Opinion in the First Church of Opinionation...

735
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,380
...and it's Right Reverend Mr. Opinion.

736
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:38,040
...and it's Right Reverend, uh, as opposed to Left Reverend, because they knew of my political persuasion.

737
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,880
We, we agree, your political...

738
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,440
Wholeheartedly.

739
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,220
Mm-hmm.

740
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:42,540
Okay.

741
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,160
We're patriots.

742
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:50,800
Oh, Dobstown, brave Dobstown, you gleam from afar on high.

743
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:57,660
You're shaped like a grape or a hot French crepe that rests on a wet dog's thigh.

744
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,380
With your jungle heat and your bogs of heat...

745
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,660
...the mosquitoes hum your praises.

746
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,100
They would have sung, but their memory's hung on the middle stanza's phrases.

747
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,400
Chop, chop, chop, we forge our future.

748
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,740
Mine them razor grass or you'll need some sutures.

749
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,780
We'll huck away to the glorious day that you embrace us with your suffocating vines.

750
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,680
The witcher's defense will.

751
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,580
We know that still.

752
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,820
One day we'll prevail, cross the Dale and yield.

753
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,460
Oh, Dobstown, a madman's dreams some say.

754
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,580
But we must close our ears to the normal's jeers and press until the sun is up to our bids.

755
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:49,940
March.

756
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,840
March.

757
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
March, Leader Gordon commands.

758
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,660
And march we will if we have to feel around in your inky black pants.

759
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,580
We'll dance with our hands for Dobstown.

760
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,820
We're entitled to you.

761
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:15,760
Uh, yes dear friends, that was Artemia Salinas' new subgenius hymn that you can sing along with,

762
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,620
Oh Dobstown.

763
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,820
And in the background we're hearing the new Amino Acids album.

764
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,620
Uh, humanity will fall like pins.

765
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,500
Uh, June 12th they have a CD.

766
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,220
CD party in Detroit I believe.

767
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,100
Uh, theaminoacids.com.

768
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,060
This is Hour of Slack, the voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

769
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,780
And you can learn more at subgenius.com.

770
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:49,660
Or post office box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

771
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,540
And now, G. Gordon Gordon and Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.

772
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,220
We'll tell you the greatest story ever told.

773
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,420
The story of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

774
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,740
So let us go back in time 20 years.

775
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,140
Into a world where gigantic fish are commonplace.

776
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,240
And man is the smallest living thing.

777
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,860
There is no sign of Wellman.

778
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,480
Uh, we're just laying low right here and hoping that, uh, we can, uh,

779
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,300
get in touch with you just as soon as ever that particular part of the psychic, uh, spectrum clears.

780
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,260
Uh, the head is in a completely inert lead isotope, uh, safe.

781
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:51,400
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens.

782
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,900
Down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course.

783
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,700
Thumping slowly like a over enlarged fig.

784
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:08,260
The bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green dripping blood.

785
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,640
It hovered briefly over the sand trap.

786
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:24,040
And then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.325 degrees.

787
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,880
Like a shark.

788
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:25,880


789
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,600
Shot off a shovel.

790
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,180
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

791
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,280
That moon faced smile was unforgettable.

792
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,760
The population, the population of Southeast Austin went wild.

793
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,420
They tore off their clothes.

794
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,480
Danced in the streets and said,

795
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,940
The bloody head has come.

796
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,620
The time is here.

797
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,080
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

798
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,840
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer.

799
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,980
Was above such things.

800
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently.

801
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,420
Buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

802
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,220
And slowly, still ever moving upwards.

803
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,880
It wobbled slightly.

804
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,100
Spraying a small osando of blood, so to speak.

805
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,320
On the people below it.

806
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,380
Healing two old ladies.

807
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:25,320
And giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

808
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,900
And there it was.

809
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,820
The bloody head was still there.

810
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


811
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


812
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


813
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


814
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


815
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:30,820


816
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,300
At 14 minutes after nine,

817
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,340
The bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Tarkstrom Air Force Base.

818
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,960
Three interceptors were scrambled,

819
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,520
one of which crashed on takeoff.

820
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,740
They could find nothing.

821
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,460
The radar was still tracking the head.

822
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,880
The bloody head moved forward.

823
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:06,260
North rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth. The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent

824
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:13,060
indications that something large and wet was moving north-northeast while ascending still

825
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:23,660
upwards towards the constellation of Orion. The bloody head moved on. Fourteen ex-virgins

826
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,820
were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

827
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:06,140
The air began to thicken over Dalhart. The head was at this time at 45,000 feet, still

828
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:12,820
climbing, still glowing. Fifteen Department of Public Safety highway patrolmen had pulled

829
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:18,460
over to the side of the road and given themselves breathalyzer tests, having seen the head.

830
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,640
Fourteen born-again ministers fell down the hill.

831
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,720
Fourteen men were down on the floor and said,

832
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:37,020
Jesus was coming again. But it was just the bloody head of Arnold Palmer, the golfer that

833
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,740
died for your sins. By the time it crossed into the time warp of southeastern Oklahoma,

834
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:52,000
the bloody head of Arnold Palmer had achieved plasma fusion state and was only slightly

835
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,640
less brilliant than the full-blown head of Arnold Palmer.

836
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:53,640


837
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:53,640


838
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:53,720
phants quaaufen as news of the

839
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,880
man's little nunn-day Sun, if a great deal smaller.

840
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,780
The University of Oklahoma called Carl Sagan, but he was too busy making a television appearance

841
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,360
to simpler.

Augustontacion.com.

844
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,800
of a launching of a head at that particular time.

845
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,760
But somehow or other, the head of Arnold Palmer had been launched.

846
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,480
The head of Arnold Palmer was now at 145,000 feet

847
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,720
and approaching southeast Arkansas.

848
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,980
The people in Little Rock,

849
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,860
the people in Little Rock,

850
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,960
the people in Little Rock burned their houses,

851
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,420
danced around naked in the mud,

852
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,940
saying the time has come.

853
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,780
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

854
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,040
rose serene, ignoring, ignoring

855
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,900
the madness below.

856
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,840
By the time they hit southern Illinois,

857
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,940
there were 145 aircraft

858
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,580
trying to find out what the hell was really going on.

859
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,280
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer appeared to be missile-proof.

860
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,500
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer appeared to be bullet-proof.

861
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,400
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer appeared to be rocket-proof.

862
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,700
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer appeared to be 100-proof.

863
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,480
This is a very, very, very important time.

864
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,100
Just a matter of seconds.

865
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,540
There were mass conversions in Indianapolis and Minnesota.

866
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,880
The Canadians were really upset.

867
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,380
They said they hadn't signed an international accord

868
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,940
to do with the leading launched heads of World Cup golfers

869
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,460
and said they didn't even know about it.

870
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,380
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer moved over the pole.

871
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,080
A little over 20 miles in altitude,

872
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,000
it had swelled up to 15 times its normal size.

873
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,420
The people all over the northern hemisphere can see it now.

874
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,180
A bland, smiling, brilliant white face,

875
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,020
slightly bigger than one half the size of a full moon.

876
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:13,640
disgruntled.

877
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,520
And that's where it still is to this day.

878
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,860
It has the thing scared the soaps.

879
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:17,920


880
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:17,920


881
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:17,920


882
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:17,920


883
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,180
slightly above the pole,

884
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,800
beaming its beneficial rays

885
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,720
down on the entire northern hemisphere,

886
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,820
but particularly down on the state of Pennsylvania,

887
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,500
which is understandable.

888
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,600
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

889
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,640
hangs above us all.

890
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,900
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

891
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,500
has come to redeem us.

892
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,680
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

893
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,080
is the only thing that matters.

894
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,460
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

895
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,760
is all that we can comprehend.

896
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,000
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

897
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,940
is all we need.

898
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,600
All we have to do is believe

899
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,560
in the martyrdom of a world cup-class golfer

900
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,820
and his subsequent immolation.

901
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,620
It's not difficult.

902
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,940
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer

903
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,360
is something that we all should believe in.

904
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,040
And he said you can just finish this thing up right now.

And so
