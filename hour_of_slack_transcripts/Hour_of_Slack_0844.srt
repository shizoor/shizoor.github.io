1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,940
And now, the Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,540
Then, a step as important as any to happiness is the opportunity for self-expression.

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:25,040
If a boy is encouraged to have slack of some sort, he is no longer bored and at a loose end.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,620
It is the slacker who is always ready for the companionship of him who finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,300
Indoctrination classes begin this a.m.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
And so, you see, they naturally fit everything. One size fits all.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,120
You sit in the little chair here, and these restraining straps keep your arms and legs from moving around.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,380
Oh, there's egg everywhere.

9
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,840
Yes, the egg will drop one at a time.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,940
No, they just slipped on the egg.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,080
They come down through this.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,780
It's okay, somebody's come in to do something.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:07,840
They are timed, so it's just as the yolk and the albumin is running off your head from the last egg that was dropped,

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,660
the timer drops another egg on your head at that time, and so the cycle goes.

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,320
And also, this high-pitched, high-intensity music will be played while you're lying prone.

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,960
What's up? What's up, homies?

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,020
A good day to...

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,200
A good day to you.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,160
And welcome y'all to Chap in the Hood.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,740
Yeah, that's right. This show's hella down.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,420
I am Sir Charles Laybridge Stuart Fotherington.

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,800
And these are my chums, Sir Fixer Blunt...

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,520
Hey, what's up?

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,660
Fahad Muhammad Rakeem...

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,580
Peace to you, my brother.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,860
And my main homeboy, Butterknife.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,660
Hiya, what's up?

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
I say, what's up, G-Dog?

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,440
Man, homs, just chillin' and shit.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,300
And to my old-school peeps doing time in Stoney Lonesome, keep your heads up.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,920
Fight the power, my brothers.

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,800
Yeah, fight the man, yeah.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,960
Well, what we do here is discuss the contemporary issues of the day that confront our post-9-11 society.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,780
Along with some scammin', slammin', and of course, jammin' with the OGs.

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah, keep it real.

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,180
Aye, it's all good.

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:19,300
You join us as we were discussing the difficulty of easily obtaining large quantities of dank in a security-obsessed society.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,060
I was voicing the opinion that...

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,140
What? Oh, shit!

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,460
Oh, my.

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,940
Aye, yo, heads up.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,800
A carload of members of a rival crew has suddenly rolled up on our crib.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,480
Damn.

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,740
I say, homies, heads up on this shit.

47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,820
We don't know what they intend.

48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,980
Yeah, watch out for that shit.

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,820
Oh, my.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
Look through the door, brother.

51
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,800
Damn.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Someone is approaching the door of our humble cottage.

53
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,940
Damn, watch out for that.

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,420
Look out.

55
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Damn, careful.

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,340
It's all good, gentlemen.

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,900
Do not fret, for I got my hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger.

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,820
Aye, it's all good.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,480
Know what I'm sayin'?

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Got your back, fool.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,960
Got your back, brother.

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,620
Got your back, brother.

63
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:57,620


64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:57,860
Hello, hello.

65
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,100
What's all this, then?

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
Good heavens.

67
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,620
It's Sam Smythe, the most infamous dodgy bastard this side of the Atlantic.

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,460
Yeah, that's right, Charlie, and I'm here because I'm right pissed, you git.

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, dear.

70
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,940
What seems to be the trouble, dear chap?

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
You be stealing some of my best wraps, mate.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm right fit to cap your arse right now.

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I know you blokes are biting my lines, and now that I caught you, your arse is mine.

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,860
I'm terribly sorry.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,240
I don't understand, my good fellow.

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,740
Aye, this fool's sayin', like, uh, you, like, stole his rap and shit.

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,380
You know what I'm sayin'?

78
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,660
You, like, you, like, stole his rhymes.

79
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,240
Ah.

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,900
You, like, stole his rhymes and shit, yeah.

81
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,660
I see.

82
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,060
Well, dear chap, I have the advantage.

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,840
You see, I got a dove sack, and my posse's got my back.

84
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,700
Got your back, fool.

85
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,120
And even if you got away, well, then, we gotta follow you home with the chrome.

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,380
Aye, we got you covered.

87
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,940
Well, mate, my boys got your arse surrounded like, outside.

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,160
So I got the drop on your sorry arse.

89
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,220
Shit, he's got homies all up in this shit.

90
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,260
You got a hell of homeboys outside.

91
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,340
There's a hell of fools out there.

92
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,620
So will you admit you ripped off my best snaps?

93
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:05,500
I say, this does look like a bit of a standoff, for I cannot recall biting a single rhyme of yours.

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,200
Look, sport, don't make me break you off something.

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,600
Do you know, I believe a few caps on your arse will quieten you down, my dear boy.

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,960
Right, well, then, there's nothing else for it.

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,960
Aye, aye, you better not try, motherfucker.

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,240
Aye, step up, fool.

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,400
Get that motherfucker, man.

100
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,740
I say, before we do this thing up proper,

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
I couldn't help noticing...

102
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,380
...that it's 420.

103
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,820
Aye, that was 420.

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,940
Shut your piehole.

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Blimey, you're right at that.

106
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,840
And you do know what that means.

107
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh, yeah.

108
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,120
420, that's the type of smoke.

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
420's down for this old school bloke.

110
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,760
Well, then, how about some hits from the bong, as it were?

111
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Do what now?

112
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,020
Hits from the bong, old boy.

113
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,180
You see, a bong is a water pipe for smoking denk.

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,740
The denk is filtered through the water.

115
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,420
When you take a fat hit,

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
the pressure drops in the head.

117
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,740
The pressure drops in the holding chamber.

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,640
So the smoke gets pulled through the water.

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,180
You think I don't know what a bong is?

120
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,960
I rolled in that get low hood too, squire.

121
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,360
Let's take some fat green hits from that five footer.

122
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,440
Here.

123
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,180
Alright, governor.

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,780
Oh, what is that, eh?

125
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,060
Ah, yes.

126
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Ah, yes.

127
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:23,740


128
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,280
Lovely.

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Blimey, that's the chronic that is.

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,400
Hey, yo, this is clogged, G.

131
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,580
Say, that pipe's bugged.

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,220
That's rather fat one.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Yo, don't hide the crock, cause I got the easy one.

134
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,580
Hey, yo, look out for that cherry, fool.

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, bloody hell.

136
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,220
What seems to be the trouble?

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,960
What, what?

138
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh, bollocks.

139
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,320
I'll burn a hole in me brand new diggy.

140
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,280
Ah, don't trouble yourself about that.

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,680
You may have one of mine.

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,020
What?

143
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,680
I say, butter knife, roll us some fatties, Holmes.

144
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,560
Damn, fool.

145
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,540
I already rolled up some hella fat spears.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,980
Look at that fool.

147
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,840
Hey, I got the most...

148
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,860
Ah.

149
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,920
Oh, bugger, beam me up, Scotty.

150
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,580
That's the dank that is.

151
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,440
Tally-ho.

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,780
Oh, blimey, mate. Damn, I'm fucked up.

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,920
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.

154
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,700
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.

155
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.

156
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,600
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.

157
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh, yes. Are you down with Nickies?

158
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:19,740
Oh, yes. Are you down with Nickies?

159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,120
Well, I used to drink them every day.

160
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,680
Straight forties to the head, fool.

161
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,520
Ah, butter knife, forties for us all.

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,520
It's all good.

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,600
Yeah.

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:31,940
Yeah.

165
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,880
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.

166
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,080
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,740
Ah, damn.

168
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,700
Right, um, what were we on about?

169
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,240
You know, call me daft, but strangely enough,

170
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,860
I can't seem to remember.

171
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,820
Hmm.

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,140
They forgot what it was about the Bustercat.

173
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,060
That's fucked up.

174
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,600
They forgot.

175
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,700
Yeah, that's fucked up.

176
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,440
Hey, yo, trip on this, governor.

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,960
You wanna go score a fat key then, Charlie?

178
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,740
Indeed.

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,740
Let's go half on a bag of dank.

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,660
We could go down to pub and bomb up on a Guinness.

181
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,200
Maybe throw a few darts like.

182
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,220
Oh, yeah, man. I'm all up in the Guinness.

183
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,140
Spot on. You read my mind, L. Bean.

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,720
Spot on. You read my mind, L. Bean.

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,080
Let's roll up on that place.

186
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,180
Damn, it's cold.

187
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,920
Well, once again, we out of here.

188
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,560
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,560
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,920
One. While you were at your job working nine to five,

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,120
One. While you were at your job working nine to five,

192
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,340
the Beastie Boys were at the garden cold-kicking it live.

193
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,920
And two. Remember,

194
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,580
to all my peoples in the pens,

195
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,100
keep your head up, keeping it real out in the field, y'all.

196
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,180
And if you don't know...

197
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,240
And if you don't know...

198
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,260
Now you know.

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,420
Let's go, brother. We ghost.

200
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
Come on, fool. You're waiting on your ass.

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,420
Well, we've got to slide. This bit's been played out.

202
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,420
See you around. Peace out.

203
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,480
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

204
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

205
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,620
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

206
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,360
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

207
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,780
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

208
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

209
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Cheerio. Pip-pip and all that.

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,460

But friends I've got someone

235
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,300
to talk to ya'll

236
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,900
about whizzing by

237
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,760
our planet by a

238
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,500
mere seventy-five

239
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,760
thousand miles

240
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,440
from this news story ever since

241
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,340
news was invented. And

242
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,100
its barely a blip in the media

243
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,820
of friends that will be forgotten tomorrow. A tiny zit between some supermodel's breasts

244
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,840
on a hair goo commercial. Check this out. Astronomers have revealed that on June 14th,

245
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,540
an asteroid the size of a football field made one of the closest ever recorded approaches

246
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,440
to the Earth. It is only the sixth time an asteroid has been seen to penetrate the moon's

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,920
orbit, and this is by far the biggest rock to do so. What has worried some astronomers,

248
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,660
though, is that the space object was only detected on June 17th, several days after

249
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:51,960
its flyby. Cataloged as 2002 MN, the asteroid was traveling over 10 kilometers a second,

250
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:00,920
23,000 miles per hour, when it passed Earth at a distance of only 75,000 miles. It's a

251
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,420
wake-up call.

252
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,220
Wake-up call, friends. If it had hit the Earth, it would have caused local devastation

253
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:15,700
similar to that which occurred in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908, said Dr. John Davies of

254
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,840
the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. If an asteroid were to approach close to an imaginary line

255
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,880
joining the Earth and the Sun, it would never be visible in a nighttime sky and would be

256
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,260
quite impossible to discover with normal telescopes. Its arrival would come literally

257
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,340
as a bolt from the blue.

258
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,600
Friends, we wouldn't even have known what hit us. There'd have been a nuclear-sized

259
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,700
explosion in Madagascar or someplace, and every nuke in the northern hemisphere would

260
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,420
have left its silo, and even if they didn't go off, it'd be cloudy days and bad crops

261
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,300
for a hundred years. But will they learn? Hell no! The X's give them this blatant warning,

262
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,240
a shot right over their heads, and do they heed? No! They go on with their pop stars,

263
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,140
and their sports, and their worries about the textile contracts getting to the print

264
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,320
shop on time. Gabriel blows his horn right in their domagogue faces, and they just kinda

265
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,340
go, huh? And carry on with their fretful little lives. Friends, nothing can shake them from

266
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,980
their complacency. You plop their most trusted symbol into their most trusted symbol and

267
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:30,200
kill so many of them it's like spraying for bugs, and still they act just like bugs. Friends,

268
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,420
this rock will be back.

269
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
They'll be back around again, and they'll still let it sneak up on them. They could

270
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,400
have been ready if they'd been half serious about all their nuke toys. They'd have seen

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,000
this coming. And even if it came out of the sun like a bat out of hell, they could have

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,920
used it for some hellacious target practice. But no, friends, they wussed out again. If

273
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,700
they had any nut, they'd pay Dr. Legume to perfect that meteor magnet of his so that

274
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,000
the next time it would hit them dead on and put them out of their foul misery.

275
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,180
But first, friends, let me get off and let Barbie slack.

276
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,380
. All right. The thing is, if that meteor would've slammed into somewhere in America,

277
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,140
George Bush and Dick Cheney would've gone attacking anything that moved in any part

278
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,740
of the world.

279
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,700
Yeah, that's the other .

280
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,420
But they would've been in their nice little Bush penthouses and –

281
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
All of our nukes would've been there.

282
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,280
have gone off automatically. All of the

283
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,300
other guys' nukes would have gone off automatically.

284
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,400
If the asteroid had only

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,480
wiped out a few Bushmen in Australia,

286
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,980
we would finish

287
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,840
wiping off everybody.

288
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,220
But why couldn't it wipe out the Bushmen

289
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,360
in Washington, D.C., and we would all

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,940
be safe sleeping in our beds?

291
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,580
Dave, you can't say that kind of stuff.

292
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,920
Can you feel it? No.

293
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,100
Can you emotionally? Not on the radio.

294
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,240
You can't even emotionally feel it

295
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,120
on the radio? No. Why not?

296
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
No, you don't really want a whole bunch

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,940
of people wiped out unless

298
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,400
it's been carefully

299
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,580
planned by Bob.

300
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,860
You cannot specifically say

301
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,880
anything about wiping out

302
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
anything to do with the president.

303
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,540
You can make fun of the president all

304
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,980
you want to. Okay, I had a

305
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,920
vague dream where he fell down the steps

306
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,620
and he couldn't get up.

307
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
But Dave was talking

308
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
about an asteroid from outer space.

309
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,720
Right, I was saying if it was more correctly

310
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,960
positioned, our favor would have increased.

311
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,720
No, but just don't pick on GW.

312
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
No, because he never picked Sean.

313
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,060
I don't want a new FBI file

314
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,620
on this. Now, Chaz, how

315
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,040
come, you know where I heard about

316
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,980
that asteroid that barely

317
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,880
missed the Earth? Canada. From you.

318
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,580
You emailed me the news.

319
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,100
I didn't hear anybody else talking about it.

320
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,100
It's kind of

321
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,760
around, just like Planet X.

322
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,440
Well, it's just this little thing happening.

323
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,960
I hadn't heard about it either. Somebody emailed it to me.

324
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,420
Yeah. Oh, really?

325
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,820
It's not even

326
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,460
No.

327
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,580
Not even.

328
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,160
Regular radio talk.

329
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
No, just a friendly email came in.

330
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,880
Isn't that synchronistic to you, though, that this

331
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,060
occurred so close to your own day of X's?

332
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,140
I mean, just think of it. There is some sort of

333
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,080
cosmic interlude which bubbles beneath your

334
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,220
pants. You can just see it. You can smell it,

335
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,980
too, unfortunately. Well, the moral of the story is

336
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,060
they paid no attention. They're not interested

337
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,740
and the next time it happens, they'll go,

338
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,500
oh, gosh, what a surprise.

339
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,080
But we know it probably won't hit Brushwood

340
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
now. Hello? Protection

341
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
up in place. Too bad we didn't

342
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,180
use our used old nuclear weapon.

343
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
It's a shield against

344
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,680
asteroids and collars

345
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,980
from the beyond. Everybody's looking

346
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,160
for Osama, but I think he's hiding in the asteroid.

347
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,840
I think that's where he's at right now.

348
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,920
I think his face is the face

349
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,940
buried in the asteroid. No, but I'm surprised no

350
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,120
religious cults or anything aren't out there, you know,

351
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,420
calling it for it to come back.

352
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,040
Well, they're always off base, much like

353
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
you know, the Church of the Subgenius.

354
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,980
Swore that he would improve

355
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,820
his meteor magnet.

356
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,980
Yeah. Can I ask you

357
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,020
about your mental health a little bit, Reverend?

358
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,200
I don't have any. You're taking these deep

359
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,120
sighs. Are you on some sort of a

360
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,180
Lincoln-ish drug, or are you just

361
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,920
a... I've got methane. I'm just

362
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,180
emitting the methane right now

363
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,840
and I'm sucking it in deep. He's lit, baby.

364
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,220
He's lit. I mean, it's like, you know, what's with all the

365
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,240
You can run your

366
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,180
house on methane if you eat

367
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,720
enough beatery, my friend.

368
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,920
Well, I'm trying, but, you know,

369
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,160
I've been trying to breathe it because I heard

370
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,060
it was economical. Unfortunately, it's

371
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,240
not working too well. Well, you'll create your own planets

372
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,180
in your bowels if you do, because methane...

373
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,500
Methane is the crescent of all lifelessness.

374
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,380
But we have a funnel over the house.

375
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,380
So, I'm trying.

376
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,140
Deck no!

377
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,900
Woo-hoo! My friends, that asteroid

378
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,020
could have your name on it. There could be another

379
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,000
big sister asteroid coming right

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,060
behind 2002MM.

381
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,160
It could be B-O-B

382
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,860
13013 with

383
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,040
your name on its name tag,

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,740
buddy. Your house address.

385
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,740
Can you sell advertising states on the asteroid?

386
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,780
He's still talking over there.

387
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Ivan Stank can talk forever.

388
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying.

389
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,160
Bringing the word

390
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,880
to the big night at Heathen.

391
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,180
I want you to check a box

392
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,620
next to each one of these that's a true statement.

393
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,380
Come on, everybody. Let's go get fresh eggs, ham, and bacon.

394
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,560
A true statement. I salivate

395
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,640
at the sight of mittens, true or false?

396
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,380
Garlic.

397
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,600
My father was a good woman,

398
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,540
true or false?

399
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,240
A little salsa in there.

400
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,740
My mother dresses me funny, true or false?

401
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,200
I believe

402
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
in an afterbirth?

403
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,540
True or false?

404
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,300
This is a subgenius quiz.

405
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,580
I often lie to make myself obnoxious, true or false?

406
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,840
I prefer spiders to lima beans?

407
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,040
Spiders?

408
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,060
Digitally.

409
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,760
Think you're most older than your dad, Tom.

410
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,740
Often I think I am a special agent.

411
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,140
Plan is to

412
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,160
invade, to infest key men

413
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,120
in government and industry with

414
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
some alien force from outer space

415
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,860
that...

416
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,140
seeps into the human body and takes over.

417
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,640
Bob.

418
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,160
But let's leave things of this world behind

419
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,620
and walk now down the path of Bob

420
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,560
for this brief minute of slack

421
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,180
from the church of the subgenius.

422
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,600
from the church of the subgenius.

423
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Ah, yes, dear friends,

424
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
this is Reverend Ivan Stang

425
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,500
with another reading from the sacred

426
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,540
pre-scriptures of the church of the subgenius.

427
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,660
And, yea,

428
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,100
he climbeth down chimneys

429
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,580
and delivereth us the gifts of the flesh

430
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,180
and of slack. He will not be a slave,

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,700
he commandeth horned demons

432
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,660
with cloven hoofs to take to the air

433
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,940
and pull him in his chariot in glory.

434
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,940
For he knoweth when thou

435
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,300
hast been sleeping, and he knoweth

436
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,340
when thou art awake.

437
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,180
He judgeth if thou art

438
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,740
damned or worthy.

439
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,980
So heedeth this for thine

440
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,240
own sake, for his eyes

441
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,020
are everywhere, like unto

442
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,880
Big Brother. He puffeth

443
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
on his pipe, and laugheth

444
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,020
at our follies like a bowl

445
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,180
full of Vaseline. But yet,

446
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,740
yea, in his mercy,

447
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,640
he giveth us days off,

448
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,900
and he bringeth us goods, yet billeth

449
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,020
us not. So imagine, friends, somewhere

450
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,020
in the snowy north, the Santa

451
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,940
Bob trudges mindlessly

452
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,680
on, driven by strange

453
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
forces to complete his

454
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,060
nameless errands. And he

455
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,660
may show up at your house.

456
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
If you've been a good

457
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,740
subgenius,

458
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,340
let there be slack.

459
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,040
We've seen

460
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,120
Santa on his way, and he

461
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
missed us by seventy-five thousand

462
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,380
scant miles. A Nordic

463
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,320
whatever the hell it is

464
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,960
trying to wipe out the planet, I'm sorry.

465
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,780
That was just strange to see.

466
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,180
An asteroid with the face of Wotan

467
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,500
narrowly missed

468
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,020
the planet Earth, although we couldn't see

469
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,180
its face since it was coming

470
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,260
from the sun. They didn't even know it was coming

471
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,460
until it was on its way

472
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
away. Yea, away.

473
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,080
Three days later. Can we get

474
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,040
away from Wotan and have our own gods

475
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,840
like Bhutan and Cretan and...

476
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
you know, the more friendly deities?

477
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, where have you been? Of course we've

478
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
done all that. Been there, done that.

479
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,120
Well, gee, that's what I wanted to hear. Poofty

480
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,920
poofty poof. I want an explanation.

481
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,820
Zeus, Wotan,

482
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,460
Negi, the old ones,

483
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,080
Nyarlathotep, the babbling idiot

484
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,340
blind god who crawls at the

485
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,920
edge of the earth.

486
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,260
The old

487
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,720
faith.

488
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Gimme that old time religion.

489
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,840
Gimme that old time religion. Frying

490
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,960
cows on the top of a mountain with

491
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,660
half-breasted young women.

492
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,840
Lifting their hearts out. Are you

493
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,560
listening, sheeple?

494
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Mithra. Are you listening, sheeple?

495
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,320
As you turn into sand.

496
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,380
As the vibrations

497
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,100
from Big Dome

498
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,160
and the corporations crush you down. Yes, friends, Bob's gospel's

499
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
coming through. The old ways are the best.

500
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,620
And we're gonna return. We're going

501
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,860
home, friends.

502
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,900
Bob's gonna take us home. We're gonna

503
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,160
party all the way. In our suitcases,

504
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
in our mind. Your blues here on

505
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,960
planet earth are over, my friend.

506
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,800
We wish it is our desires.

507
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, yes, yes. Bob's gonna take you home.

508
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,600
Can you hear the angels singing?

509
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,820
Can you hear that choir of nude

510
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,340
topless angels?

511
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,380
Table dancing angels, friends,

512
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
on the escape vessels

513
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,040
of the sex goddess. Quiet little

514
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,500
confidants. Come and see

515
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,020
darling. July 5th, this

516
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,160
year, 1998.

517
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes, friends,

518
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,140
my faith in Bob rings true.

519
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,880
Your arms will be like

520
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,100
mighty spider wings. You'll swim in

521
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,220
that pool of plasma. You'll swim

522
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,060
in that pudding like a piece of

523
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,980
cherry unctuousness in that

524
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,280
top of that scummy pie. The river

525
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
is rising!

526
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,240
And runs right through it.

527
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,580
Try to breathe.

528
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,440
Try to breathe.

529
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,040
Bob's got a life

530
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,020
preserver that he could go to. A river of slack

531
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,760
runs right through that

532
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,580
Brushwood Folklore Center.

533
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,820
And your hands

534
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,040
and his hands will

535
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,340
merge in the cosmos.

536
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,060
And your brain and his brain

537
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,480
will be one brain.

538
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,640
What the fuck, Jeff?

539
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,980
He's got the whole world in his

540
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,200
brain. He's got the whole world

541
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,460
in his brain.

542
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,960
What if there is a form of life in space?

543
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,940
Not on some planet, but

544
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,140
just drifting. Not life as

545
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,040
we know it. With intelligence, yes,

546
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,160
but pure energy with no organic

547
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,860
structure. Invisible. Invisible?

548
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,960
Now the rocket passed through its path. It

549
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,840
entered the rocket. It found living specimens

550
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,800
of our form of life. Cell

551
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,760
organisms. Humans, exactly.

552
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,920
Now, if even by accident

553
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,580
it could enter one of those structures,

554
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,660
what a way to invade

555
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,700
the Earth. Now look, sir, I'm not

556
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,740
over intelligent, but when you... You saw the film, you know

557
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,580
what happened. Holy God

558
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,600
knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

559
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,220
Something got into that rocket.

560
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,120
And it's found other forms of life.

561
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,420
The cactus.

562
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,560
You mean

563
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,620
Kuruza? The cactus. He's now in

564
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,460
the shell of the man being transformed.

565
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,800
If one of these cactus plants was subject

566
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
to the same mutation, there could be an affinity,

567
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,500
a union between plant and animal,

568
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,920
with the ability to destroy

569
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,840
and possess

570
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,380
and multiply.

571
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
An alien cannot invade

572
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,560
a dead man. We're merely using this

573
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,520
corpse for a demonstration of placement.

574
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,440
You ever been in a cockpit before?

575
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,780
No, sir, I've never been up in a plane

576
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,720
before. You ever

577
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,140
seen a grown man naked?

578
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,360
Shite. Oh,

579
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,840
X-Day, yeah.

580
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,580
I really don't care who's gonna be

581
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,640
playing. Well, what do you mean who's gonna play

582
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,500
Saturday night? There is no

583
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,640
Saturday night. There's no playing

584
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,460
neither. Friday morning at

585
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,840
7 a.m. forever

586
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,640
and ever and ever. Look at this nice

587
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,780
sunrise. Until the bulls come, yeah.

588
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,720
A little bit chilly. With their clubs

589
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,940
and their trenches. Forever and ever

590
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,820
and ever. Yeah, they're

591
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
gonna make us move to another camp, another X-Day,

592
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,760
further on down the line.

593
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
Frogs down in the pond

594
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,560
making their little sexy

595
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,620
sound. Enjoy the chirping while you can.

596
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,540
We'll be eating out of bean cans

597
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,520
five miles down the road, depending

598
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
on whether the pigs come or not. Friends, those of you

599
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,220
who've been to Brushwood,

600
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,280
I want you to listen to these sounds

601
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,100
and be ready for a lot more.

602
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,760
What they're doing is, it's these tiny little

603
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,520
frogs that live in the ponds

604
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,580
and they, as a mating

605
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,900
call, they stretch their little frog

606
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,620
penile cloacas

607
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,180
as far as they do and they

608
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,700
strum them. They pull them real

609
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,240
tight with one little forearm

610
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,740
and they strum them. Thus

611
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,900
the phrase, pluck your magic

612
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,180
twanger, frog.

613
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,720
Heard

614
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,460
in the background.

615
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,720
Oh man, we gotta get more of these frogs. Look,

616
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,500
they're glowing. Put them in the box here.

617
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,720
It always rains at X-Day. Make sure you

618
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,240
don't get out these things. And you end up

619
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,780
huddling under these teepees

620
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,080
and tents with the

621
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,320
pagans and the

622
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
subgeniuses. It's not gonna be my government truck. It's gonna

623
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,460
look like a regular truck. It's gonna be a

624
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,600
fucking thing. And that's actually where the

625
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,540
show is, friends. It honestly

626
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,720
is. They're sure there'll be some

627
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,780
preachers and some

628
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,680
bands and all

629
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,360
that stuff and a stage.

630
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,340
But when, really

631
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,440
the best part of X-Day

632
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,820
is when it rains and you're...

633
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,000
stuck

634
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,620
with someone you didn't know before.

635
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,740
A bunch of weirdos that you really

636
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,660
didn't want to get stuck with. There you are. You're

637
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,740
stuck with them under the trees or under

638
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,660
somebody's little tent.

639
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,680
Gotta share the same ovaries

640
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,800
and the same can of beans if you want to

641
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,640
get along with the flops. You're forced to deal

642
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,260
with the other subgeniuses.

643
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,880
It's long been raining down here,

644
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,640
Sporty. You're forced

645
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,300
into it. It's called

646
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
involuntary slack, friends, and sometimes

647
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,740
it's the best kind. Because you don't know

648
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,800
what slack is until...

649
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,560
But it could be something you never

650
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,760
heard of before. It could

651
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,680
be something you don't think

652
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,900
you want right now.

653
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
Like a job.

654
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,700
Can you believe there could be such a thing

655
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,300
as a slackful job?

656
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,660
Believe it or not,

657
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,520
there could be such a thing.

658
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,300
You don't know.

659
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,800
You don't know if it's gonna be good or

660
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,780
bad. You don't know if an asteroid's gonna

661
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,040
come flying out of God's

662
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,760
spitwild,

663
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,460
or if you're gonna win the lottery tomorrow.

664
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
You don't know.

665
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,040
Tomorrow may not be your tomorrow.

666
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,980
It may be someone else's today.

667
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,420
So you can either just

668
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,000
not find out.

669
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,860
There's only one way to do that.

670
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,700
That's to do like Man the Song says.

671
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,480
Just go ahead.

672
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,760
Jump off the bridge. Hey, you know,

673
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
somebody was saying,

674
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,620
Chaz, somebody said,

675
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
now if everybody jumped off a bridge,

676
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,620
everybody jumped off a bridge,

677
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,580
would you jump off a bridge too? And I said,

678
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,260
well, eventually,

679
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
probably would. You know,

680
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,140
after breaking into every drugstore

681
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,780
and robbing...

682
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,500
I think that's... Driving, you know,

683
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,880
wrecking Maseratis all day.

684
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,100
Well, by then you'd have a big pile of humans, and it

685
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,760
wouldn't be much of a jump at all. Right.

686
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,420
It would cushion you. So actually,

687
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,800
the idea's like moot, as they say.

688
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
Eventually. I'm thinking, you know,

689
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,580
after ten years, wouldn't you get tired

690
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,680
of being alone? You'd get lonesome.

691
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
You'd finally do what everybody else had done

692
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,360
and jump off the bridge.

693
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,340
I'm lonesome. If everybody jumped off the bridge.

694
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm gonna jump off the nearest bridge. I don't know, really.

695
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,420
You know, if you could get your hands on a real doll,

696
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,060
you might...

697
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,800
You might idle your years away

698
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,360
in plastic splendor. Well, I mean, for a while.

699
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
That's why I say, eventually, you wouldn't

700
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,740
go, oh, look, everybody's jumping off the

701
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,960
cliff. Wait, are the other animals

702
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,800
still here, though? You'd let them jump off the

703
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,920
cliff. You'd go out and party.

704
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,500
You could use the animals as cushions, too,

705
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,640
along with the dead bodies. No, I'm not worried about cushions for the animals.

706
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,760
But... Why not? You're thinking about

707
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,820
love and tenderness, right? Yeah.

708
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,760
Well, I could go live with a bunch of chimps. Well, a corpse can be pretty tender

709
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,680
after it's decayed for a while. Yeah.

710
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,760
I'd just be their king.

711
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,720
I could be the chimp king. The king of the corpses? Oh, the

712
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,820
chimps. I thought you were gonna be

713
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,300
the necro-king of the corpses.

714
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah. Me, Chaz! Me, Vanovo King!

715
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,360
Five-finger man!

716
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,940
Yeah. So maybe

717
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,820
I would, you know, maybe I could make it

718
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,920
interesting. You know, a game of it, you know?

719
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,840
And sperm monkeys, the rest of your

720
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,880
poor existence? If the other animals were still here. But if the other

721
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,800
animals were not here, and you were

722
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,360
the only living...

723
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,340
The only sentient sort of thing.

724
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,840
Mammal, yeah.

725
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,780
Yeah, if the lizards were all here. That wouldn't be much

726
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,760
of a party if you were the only sentient mammal

727
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,420
on Earth.

728
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,780
That would get even the lowest dog

729
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,640
lonesome. That's terrible

730
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,940
to think about. In fact, why did you

731
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,880
bring up such an ill prescription to begin with?

732
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,140
Eventually you'd jump off the cliff, too.

733
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,980
Eventually. Might be twenty years.

734
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,920
Thirty years. So, I'd get an AK-47

735
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,820
and, like, do target practice on the corpses,

736
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,760
like, for jokes and stuff, and wear their hats

737
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,820
and everything, and take pictures of them next to them.

738
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,260
And then they'd be close to me sitting in the chairs, you know?

739
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,620
I'd put my arm around them, you know?

740
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,140
But then they'd rot away. That would only last you a year or so.

741
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,860
Right. And then it probably wouldn't be too pleasant

742
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,100
if there'd be skulls. Then there'd be skulls.

743
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,800
Well, those would be fun to have bowling matches with

744
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,060
and, like, new ball games. With who?

745
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,760
Yourself. Don't get... Think of the internal

746
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,700
man, Chaz. You're so socially oriented.

747
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,760
It might be the best thing there is

748
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,580
to have. Wait, taps for the human race.

749
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,620
The Omega

750
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,320
man plays the bugle.

751
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,960
When 2-0-0-2

752
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,840
MN sister...

753
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,020
Sister meteor.

754
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,140
Eight times beside.

755
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,360
Slams into Earth

756
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,640
three weeks from now.

757
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,360
When he comes screaming out of the sunlight.

758
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,760
He's standing in that same position that he has been

759
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,740
for the last 25 years

760
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,880
since 9-1-1. Only the cockroaches will survive.

761
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
That fateful year, that fateful day,

762
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,360
that fateful morning.

763
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,160
And here comes the Corps of Engineers

764
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,860
to erect the dam now, the instant cookie.

765
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,640
And they're filling him up right away.

766
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,360
And there's the president off on his merry, merry way.

767
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,820
Another celebration

768
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,140
of America,

769
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,920
of our pride, and our true feelings

770
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,560
for ourselves,

771
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,420
as this day,

772
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,120
the 379,000th day

773
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,700
since the first day

774
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,460
that everything changed,

775
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,600
begins once again.

776
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,660
And you'll be

777
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,640
a fool to cry

778
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,480
on that day,

779
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,740
July 5th,

780
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,380
1998. There'll be no crying

781
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,380
on July 5th, 1998,

782
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,140
whenever that is coming up.

783
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,760
Coming up in 2002.

784
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,460
There'll be no crying

785
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,600
on that morning.

786
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,140
There'll be only happiness

787
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,700
as we all

788
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,680
take a dip in that pool,

789
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,300
baptize ourselves.

790
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,880
What about us fellows

791
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,300
in the detention center?

792
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,740
Are we gonna have an easy time?

793
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,000
We're dead, huh?

794
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,200
No pie in the sky for the detention center guys.

795
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,360
Are you afraid to die?

796
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,260
We're gonna dive in,

797
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,780
to plunge into the plasma bomb.

798
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,500
It's wrong

799
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
because there's nothing wrong with it.

800
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,500
It's fine.

801
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,720
It's wrong.

802
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,540
No, no, no.

803
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,620
It's wrong.

804
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,600
And when did you become aware?

805
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,820
About five years ago.

806
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,720
Uh huh.

807
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,200
What happened five years ago?

808
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,600
Came to know the Lord.

809
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,080
Oh,

810
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,020
how special.

811
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,920
So,

812
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,280
back then, five years ago,

813
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,320
at that time,

814
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,400
Intense, intensified

815
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,160
smell.

816
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,460
It intensified, right.

817
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
Yes. Right.

818
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,420
Did your life intensifying?

819
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,100
I became kind.

820
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,320
That's wonderful.

821
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Yes. Yes. Yes.

822
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,500
Well, we're gonna see about that.

823
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm gonna,

824
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm gonna

825
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,500
Bible, right?

826
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,840
Now, oh, but,

827
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,920
Okay.

828
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay.

829
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,680
What we can do is we can do it in things

830
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,040
we as adults

831
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,860
or let the

832
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,920
��

833
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
At the end

834
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,720
never experienced love or friendship or formed any lasting or constructive relationship.

835
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:09,460
But today at last they will become a part of something. They will belong. They will

836
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,160
come a little closer to their unrealistic dreams of power and glory. Today finally they

837
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:25,280
will join the stupid ghastly tragic church of the subgenius. Please remove your jackets

838
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:34,960
and roll up your left shirt sleeves. Yeah, yeah mate. My spaceship's pretty cool. My

839
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:44,820
spaceship is. My pleasure vessel is very pleasurable. And now it's all over.

840
00:32:44,820 --> 00:33:00,100
It's all over now. There is no more earth. Heavy as God. The earth has been burned to

841
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:09,600
a cinder. All their little wars are as nothing compared to what the exes done to them.

842
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,540
But you know I kind of miss the old gal, the earth, now that it's gone. I've preserved

843
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,080
a few chunks. Chaz, did you know over on my pleasure vessel I kept a couple of that big

844
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,040
museum from Amsterdam. I was over there playing golf the other day. Yeah. Did you notice I

845
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,840
got the Grand Canyon? That's a great, yeah. Nobody else even thought about that. Oh, I

846
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,900
thought about it, but damn, this one's cool too. Yeah, you've got those golf greens from

847
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,800
those fancy golf greens. Yeah, yeah. I've got those golf greens. I've got those golf

848
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,180
However renowned

849
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,520
pnk6

850
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,960
pnk6

851
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:54,960


852
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,900
know

853
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,160
that

854
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,740
cheese

855
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,880
pnk6

856
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,260
he's my navigator now

857
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,220
it's weird what some of the subgeniuses have done

858
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,960
I've noticed

859
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,840
when they suddenly for $30

860
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,940
had all the power in the world

861
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,520
could do anything they wanted

862
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,480
some of the most trivial crap

863
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,400
you know like beaming up all the

864
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,560
the old little Lulu comics

865
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,340
from the 40s

866
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,840
weird stuff like that

867
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,080
and other stuff got just completely

868
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,020
trashed on X Day

869
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,260
I'm sure I mean look at

870
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,760
there's just a cinder down there

871
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,280
and then we all got what we wanted

872
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,260
and burned the hell out of it

873
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,740
I just have a feeling a lot of people

874
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,560
are going to be going

875
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,540
oh damn I forgot my dog

876
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,180
oh my little brother

877
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,840
you're not really hearing this broadcast

878
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,440
either

879
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,420
it isn't happening

880
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,660
but hey isn't that

881
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:08,900
what

882
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,300
what

883
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,320
what

884
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,000
, isn't that an interesting thing though

885
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,420
that if you're in a band

886
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,960
that has a big influence on a generation

887
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,820
when you die

888
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,640
your music is emanating out from earth

889
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,720
at the speed of light

890
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,280
along with your spirit

891
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,640
yeah too bad you're not going with it

892
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,780
no you know that's if they leave the planet

893
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,300
I was thinking about that

894
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,240
when you said that earlier

895
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,800
I was thinking well

896
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,780
what if they don't leave the planet

897
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,580
what if all the spirits just stick around

898
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,180
that's a hell of a lot of ghosts

899
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,480
and think of the elephants

900
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
and the birds

901
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,880
and the blue whales

902
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,420
what about the great big things

903
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,040
where do they go

904
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,320
where do their souls go

905
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,640
when they die

906
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,120
one of the things

907
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,520
one of the things I have is

908
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,320
are they stacking up on the ocean

909
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,020
check this out

910
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,000
on my pleasure ship

911
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,200
every half hour or so

912
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,820
an F-16 does a flyby

913
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,400
and it's

914
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,500
it's like you gotta watch for it

915
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,900
it just kind of keeps you awake

916
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,480
where it comes from

917
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,360
oh man

918
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,840
what you guys

919
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,620
you're kind of low

920
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,560
isn't that cool

921
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,160
that was the actually supernatural shell

922
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,400
of one of those blue whales

923
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,300
in another dimension

924
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,420
so I think you're probably confused

925
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,300
in between the two of you

926
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,620
the two perceptual vacuums

927
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,720
I have guests in my pleasure vessel

928
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,700
I forgot to queue up for a CD

929
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,440
did anybody remember to save the whales

930
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,340
out of the four or five thousand subgeniuses

931
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,260
that happen to still have their membership cards

932
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,920
the next day

933
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,640
did any of them remember the whales

934
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,980
what about Legumes Ark

935
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,160
what about Legumes Ark

936
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,460
he took two of everything

937
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,700
only two

938
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,120
but it was stuff like leaves

939
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,840
and pieces of dead crayon

940
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
and stuff like that

941
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,480
I'm sure he's making

942
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,740
NAD's saute of each and every beat

943
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,280
he's taking away

944
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,920
rustic samples

945
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,320
of every type of pubic hair

946
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,020
ever invented

947
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,300
two of each kind

948
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,780
Frizzy

949
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,720
Will-o'-the-Wisp

950
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,420
Predronatoral

951
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:47,920
and

952
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,440
well there's the last Bengal tiger

953
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,380
and cricket expectorant

954
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,580
well there's the last white rhinoceros

955
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,160
mmm

956
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,060
boy these NAD's are good

957
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,880
what shall I have next

958
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,500
are you talking about goat vessels

959
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,980
are you talking about the

960
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,000
perhaps the drum

961
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
that might be used

962
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,440
to pronounce goat rhythms

963
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
like panwood

964
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,260
what would you

965
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,280
what would you

966
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,520
what did you bring with you

967
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,140
on next day

968
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,580
what did you

969
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,180
I brought a pair

970
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,660
I brought my own NAD's

971
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,600
my own NAD's

972
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:14,840
great

973
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,640
and that was two of every kind

974
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,020
I could think of

975
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,640
don't rub it in man

976
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,600
he's just

977
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,900
or one of every kind

978
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,800
it doesn't matter

979
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,560
he's such a

980
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,620
he's a flashy

981
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,880
or the number doesn't matter

982
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,300
he's got

983
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,820
his NAD's are the kind

984
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,780
the kind NAD's

985
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,200
the kind that makes

986
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,580
hamsters and rabbits

987
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,860
and small animals

988
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,400
run in disarray

989
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,180
the kind that makes

990
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,880
small mammals

991
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,260
cry

992
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,340
yeah

993
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,060
they have tear ducts

994
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,580
just like the rest of us do

995
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,460
when properly used

996
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,380
well

997
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,760
it could be

998
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,500
the last

999
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,960
last

1000
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,520
last

1001
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,060
last

1002
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,700
but in the Mayan calendar

1003
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,900
it's 2012

1004
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,420
or is it 2002

1005
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,640
and obviously

1006
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,740
Charlie Manson

1007
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,440
had the correct

1008
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,080
interpretation

1009
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,260
for this song

1010
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,420
we don't know

1011
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,460
what year it is

1012
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,580
which the end

1013
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,700
comes baby

1014
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,740
get out

1015
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,520
it is a scam

1016
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,060
I

1017
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,280
I

1018
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,860
I

1019
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,500
is a scam

1020
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,260
it's a scam

1021
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,440
Freddy L delicate

1022
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,880
nine

1023
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,220
it

1024
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,020
I eat

1025
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,740
P shell

1026
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,560
izione

1027
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,500
and is

1028
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,420
Joe

1029
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,180
that

1030
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,220
asked

1031
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,320
seven

1032
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,840
out

1033
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:38,840


1034
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:38,840


1035
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,560
Summer

1036
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,840
аюсь

1037
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,080
of pleasure vessel

1038
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,260
besides the one you get from Bob.

1039
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Well, Bob cannot be trusted.

1040
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,400
Manson was right, man.

1041
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,520
Manson was ruptured.

1042
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,620
Bob was Manson.

1043
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,100
Manson's pleasure vessel

1044
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,200
is just next door.

1045
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,880
You want to go visit Charlie?

1046
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,800
To Bob's?

1047
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,460
He's weird, man.

1048
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,780
They had him on some strange drugs

1049
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,920
when he was in prison.

1050
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,940
Well, I remember the Indians

1051
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,900
used to try and drown

1052
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,140
his pronouncements out

1053
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
when he would send letters

1054
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,780
to the family

1055
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,680
over the audio and video wave

1056
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,980
the Indians next door

1057
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,900
would go hi-yi-yi

1058
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,940
until the evil spirits

1059
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,220
went down the toilet.

1060
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Charlie was weird.

1061
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,920
Charlie was real weird.

1062
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,060
He fell in with a bad crowd.

1063
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Those silly girls.

1064
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,120
There's a lot of bad crowds

1065
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,520
going around.

1066
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,680
Think of the Japanese now.

1067
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,480
They've invented a way

1068
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,000
that they can hear with their skulls

1069
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,920
and you don't need your ear tools.

1070
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,220
No, that was in the old world, Dave.

1071
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,940
The world is gone.

1072
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,100
X-Day happened hours ago.

1073
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,640
The world that has left

1074
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,480
our memories.

1075
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,520
He doesn't remember anything.

1076
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,480
That's what he forgot.

1077
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,800
To bring with him is memory.

1078
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,300
Dave, did you get ruptured

1079
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,020
without that one brain cell of yours?

1080
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
You mean this is the day

1081
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,040
after the day

1082
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,840
after the day

1083
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,980
after the day

1084
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
after the day?

1085
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,460
Damn.

1086
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,080
Where do you think

1087
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,500
Chaz got all those jets?

1088
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,740
The sleeping voice.

1089
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,100
Think he's been saving up

1090
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,280
from his rock and roll professor job?

1091
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,960
As he's first asleep.

1092
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,820
Buying jets?

1093
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,160
Or the audience.

1094
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,840
I got the audience, too.

1095
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,160
Those are some realistic clothes

1096
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,020
you've got down there

1097
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,580
to worship your ass, Chaz.

1098
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:08,980
The windows.

1099
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,380
You're really into that

1100
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,680
rock star thing, aren't you?

1101
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,640
Yeah, every day.

1102
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,220
The golf playing rock star.

1103
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,080
It's a stadium concert every day.

1104
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,140
You always wanted to.

1105
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,920
I got all the good rock stadiums.

1106
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,460
Which one is this?

1107
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,220
And Bob Dylan.

1108
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,760
This is Wimbledon, right?

1109
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,840
Did you bring Bob Dylan?

1110
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,260
Yeah.

1111
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,260
Yeah, man.

1112
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,260
One of the first dudes I snagged.

1113
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,100
Everybody to get on board.

1114
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
It's the day.

1115
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,020
Yeah.

1116
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,900
To the day.

1117
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
It's the end of the lifetime.

1118
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,080
When I'm twilight blood.

1119
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,180
Black and easy was the first.

1120
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,500
Now he's all black and blue.

1121
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,020
It's been a hard climb up that Route 61.

1122
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,720
Revisit you one more time.

1123
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,660
You know, my students,

1124
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
just last week,

1125
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,320
before this all happened,

1126
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,480
we were watching all the 60s stuff.

1127
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,560
Berkeley in the 60s

1128
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,160
and all the different

1129
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,120
kind of culture movement

1130
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,460
and civil rights movement and stuff.

1131
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,660
And a student come in

1132
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,320
just on the day before.

1133
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,900
It's all happened and said,

1134
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,900
I went home last night and read the paper

1135
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,240
and was amazed that all this is still going on.

1136
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
What's all this?

1137
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,920
What did I just say?

1138
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,900
The whole civil rights movement,

1139
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
the women's rights, you know,

1140
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,400
you've got fundamentalist Christians

1141
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,900
getting together with people from Sudan and Libya

1142
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,120
and Iran and Iraq to discuss anti-abortion laws

1143
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,120
and stuff like that now.

1144
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,280
So you've got religious nut cases from America

1145
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,960
that George Bush has appointed

1146
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,360
to some cabinet or another

1147
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,700
meeting with nut cases from other countries

1148
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,080
who are in the evil of access

1149
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,340
to access of evil thing.

1150
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,500
But don't dare.

1151
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,640
But it's all over now.

1152
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,160
Well, but the kids,

1153
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,500
the kids thought that was important.

1154
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,900
That stuff was still going on.

1155
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,600
It not only did it,

1156
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,680
man, it all,

1157
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,760
it will air go on

1158
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,200
and it never stopped

1159
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,660
and it's been going on.

1160
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,740
Take the blue pill

1161
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,180
or the red pill.

1162
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,000
Right.

1163
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,100
Take the blue pill.

1164
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,600
Around the block.

1165
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,120
And hey, it just keeps going on and on and on.

1166
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,680
Hey, I've been around the block.

1167
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,480
Take the red pill.

1168
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,520
It's all right, Ma.

1169
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,620
I'm only crying.

1170
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,620
And you'll get that shelter from the store.

1171
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,960
There are a few small rocks.

1172
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,120
I just want to encourage you to consider very carefully

1173
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,140
what kinds of games and toys you play with.

1174
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,140
I'm only saying this because I care about you.

1175
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,520
Hmm.

1176
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
That is pretty far fetched.

1177
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,200
But Casey, how can we know what books we should read?

1178
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,660
I'm glad you asked Bob himself.

1179
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,960
We read the books we read.

1180
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,880
Bob tells us to set any vile things before our eyes

1181
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,540
and vile means Bob does.

1182
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,760
That's right.

1183
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,700
We allow things that are sinful into our minds.

1184
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,980
Disobeying Bob is sinful.

1185
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,720
So is hating other people

1186
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,800
and doing violent things to hurt Bob.

1187
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,640
There are many things that are sinful.

1188
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,320
The point is, make sin look like a good thing.

1189
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,420
Sin is disobeying Bob.

1190
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,280
But it's not.

1191
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,520
Now think carefully about how much sin is in Bob's.

1192
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:04,960
Man!

1193
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,180
You mean I have to worry about

1194
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,840
They are Bob Doves.

1195
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,000
I thought being a kid was supposed to be fun.

1196
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,160
Bob can show you what kinds of things you should think about.

1197
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,000
I want it.

1198
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,140
Whatever is true.

1199
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,400
Whatever is noble.

1200
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,760
Whatever is right.

1201
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,840
Whatever is pure.

1202
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,100
Whatever is lovely.

1203
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,640
Whatever is admirable.

1204
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,500
If excellent or praiseworthy.

1205
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,560
But it's not.

1206
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,120
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, it's not.

1207
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,920
So you mean that we should fill our minds with

1208
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,960
They are Bob Doves.

1209
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,900
Not things that are good and worthy of praise?

1210
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,040
That's exactly right, Jimmy.

1211
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,560
If we fill our minds with evil, good things will come out of us.

1212
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,260
That's right.

1213
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,380
I think that Captain Destructo or these wrestling shows are admirable.

1214
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,660
And I think that they make Bob happy.

1215
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,840
If any TV show or movie we want to watch has too much violence, we probably should watch it.

1216
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,360
Oh.

1217
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,260
The hero in that story uses evil magic.

1218
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,460
Now you're starting to get it, Bobby.

1219
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,180
That's right.

1220
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,260
Whatever is true.

1221
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,320
Whatever is noble.

1222
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,360
Whatever is right.

1223
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,500
Whatever is pure.

1224
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,860
Whatever is lovely.

1225
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,340
Whatever is admirable.

1226
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,440
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, we should find something else to do instead.

1227
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,900
What are you doing here?

1228
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,820
I forgot the damn words, man.

1229
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,260
It's funny how Dave's pleasure vessel looks like his car.

1230
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
It's such a bell-like tone to his voice.

1231
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,840
It looks like his dingy house.

1232
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,340
It looks exactly like his car.

1233
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,100
It looks exactly like his cruddy...

1234
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,320
That's so many of them.

1235
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,420
They could have an entire planet.

1236
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,220
There's a dead Pinto in the backyard.

1237
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,360
And it looks like their apartment all the way down to the spots on the ceiling, the coffee

1238
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,500
stains on the carpet.

1239
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,480
There's one of them fuzzy things on the toilet seat.

1240
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:46,820
I know.

1241
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,700
I can't believe you.

1242
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,820
Picture Jesus with the eyes that follow you on the front.

1243
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,640
Right underneath the bed, there's a lot of dead fuzzy socks and worms living alone.

1244
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,320
The refrigerator's got a mind and a nervous system and a metabolic rate and a brain that

1245
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1246
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1247
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1248
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1249
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1250
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1251
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,320


1252
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,840
can't be helped.

1253
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,800
And because of that, it's living on its own.

1254
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,020
A lot of things are harbored in there beyond just your average shady terrorist tags.

1255
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,320
We're talking about new, new weapons of mass destruction.

1256
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,520
Now for our next experiment.

1257
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,140
The current will flow unhampered and cause them to be electrocuted.

1258
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,920
and the angels sing 1938 a little before my time

1259
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,280
jobs is now at your service

1260
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:08,680
we have to keep them all as happy as we can that's our job and that's their job is to

1261
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,020
remain in a happy blissful state at all times there are no hitches no bridges here

1262
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:21,540
a new cosmic church of the subgenius the crustacean claws spread throughout the cosmos

1263
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,720
x day

1264
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,180
we're not

1265
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,260
we're not

1266
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,960
without hitch and here we are standing on the foothills

1267
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:36,980
oh it's great to stand on the prowl of this escape vessel

1268
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:44,540
here and now in this new world after x day we don't have to pay royalties for using these

1269
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:50,740
big name rock songs in the background of our comedy routines on internet radio

1270
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,160
i didn't have to pay for them f-16z

1271
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,420
either

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,140

1316
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,900
he can't be talked to

1317
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,180
he seems like it's all coming back

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,420
i never saw so many dead birds

1366
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,500
Magic Buster.

1367
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,320
We're going to get on the Magic Buster.

1368
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,360
The Magic Buster on live at Leeds.

1369
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Why don't you go play some nice Keith Moon by himself in his underpants?

1370
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,780
I love that kind of thing.

1371
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,780
On next day, Keith Moon will rise again.

1372
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,780
John Entwistle will rise again.

1373
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,020
Hendrix will play.

1374
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,540
Lenny Bruce will open the set with some light humor.

1375
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,360
My friend Janice Johnman will sing.

1376
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,820
Jim will sing.

1377
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,360
John will sing.

1378
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,240
That's right.

1379
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,120
We're out of here.

1380
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,440
We're out of here.

1381
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,620
We'll leave the orchestra playing.

1382
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,240
Bob!

1383
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,560
We're on the run now, baby.

1384
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,360
Earth is long gone.

1385
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,340
It's long.

1386
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,440
Cinder down to nothing.

1387
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,300
It looks like there's perhaps a million of them.

1388
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,000
I didn't bring Bruce, but I did get Clarence.

1389
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,960
They're okay.

1390
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,120
Torches, flashlights.

1391
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,500
I got the sax player.

1392
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,140
I didn't take Bruce, but I got his sax player.

1393
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,060
Some of them are waving the peace with no dignity sign.

1394
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,580
Others are just waving themselves goodbye.

1395
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,580
I remembered Willie Nelson.

1396
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,900
It's our, their, his, she, his's, their, its last day here on this place.

1397
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,460
Soon to find another freaking place.

1398
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,380
Some freaking, freaking, freaking place.

1399
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,600
I remembered Bruce Dern.

1400
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,720
I remembered.

1401
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,160
I remembered.

1402
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,740
I remembered, um, Tali Shavales.

1403
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,680
Not only Tali Shavales, but, uh, Akim Tamaroff.

1404
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,920
Do you remember Akim Tamaroff?

1405
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,620
You remember the first day?

1406
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,880
Boris Karloff.

1407
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,400
Vincent Price.

1408
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,300
They'll make movies again, friends, on the escape vessels of the six goddesses.

1409
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,880
Eddie Munster.

1410
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,500
Jesus Christ, our famous horror star.

1411
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,080
Alfred Hitchcock was your favorite horror star.

1412
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,400
Willis O'Brien will animate King Kong on the best computer stuff you ever saw.

1413
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,120
Uh-oh.

1414
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1415
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1416
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,300
Nothing but mountains and seas and fields of dead birds.

1417
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,600
And thousands of decapitated heads.

1418
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,460
It's a sight for sore ears as you soar over the backgammon game.

1419
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,560
And thousands of other penalty parts played out beneath you.

1420
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,700
It's the way you wanted it.

1421
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,760
Lots of death and destruction.

1422
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,980
No dirty fingernails.

1423
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,220
Keep going.

1424
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,100
Breathing free, light and easy.

1425
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,520
And make it your way all the freaking way out of freaking, freaking, freaking.

1426
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,460
I'm sorry, Diane.

1427
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,840
Diane, I'm sorry.

1428
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,700
I didn't know you.

1429
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,500
Yeah, we got our magic bus.

1430
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,900
We gotta make the tissue.

1431
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,360
We gotta make the tissue.

1432
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,160
Did you get your magic bus?

1433
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,320
Are you gonna be there?

1434
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,000
I got my magic bus.

1435
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,300
I'm there, baby.

1436
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:47,580
I'm there.

1437
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,600
I'm there, baby.

1438
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,720
July 5th, 2002.

1439
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,240
It's time I go for a magic bus.

1440
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:53,540
For a magic bus.

1441
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,480
Double, double, double dot subgenius dot com.

1442
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,140
You're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers, friends.

1443
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,060
Get on the magic bus.

1444
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,380
Either you're with us or you're against us.

1445
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,700
Come by foot.

1446
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,780
Come by airplanes.

1447
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,880
Come by balloons.

1448
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,340
Come by any method, canoes, any means possible.

1449
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,420
But make it on down there sometime because you're not going to want to miss the final end of the world.

1450
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,000
You're gonna have a party coming to you.

1451
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You can just tell them about it.

1452
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,180
You can't incite to action.

1453
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:22,960
Okay.

1454
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,580
You can't say, get there, go there, take whatever you can.

1455
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,200
That's commercial radio, right?

1456
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,620
Yeah, right.

1457
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,540
Come on down.

1458
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,380
Yeah, right.

1459
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,020
You can't do that.

1460
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,120
But you can do, think about actually being there.

1461
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,040
You can do, and your body might follow.

1462
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,980
Think about actually being there.

1463
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,280
Remember, this is the realm of the psychic.

1464
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,000
It is in the landscape of possibilities for you to present your fantasy.

1465
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,100
It is in the landscape of possibilities for you to present your fantasy.

1466
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,540
We are visiting, again, you can do this, you have only this, you've got the opportunity to present.

1467
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,000
A physical self at Brushwood Folklore Center next weekend.

1468
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,140
Not this one, next one.

1469
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,440
And what a sumptuous landscape it could possibly be on your mind's left eye.

1470
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,120
A physical self at Brushwood Folklore Center next weekend.

1471
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,120


1472
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,120


1473
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,300
Just think of all the naked women which might be there.

1474
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:01,800
Just think of all the naked women which might be there.

1475
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,300
Think of all the horrifically stupid parties you'll go to and take too many drugs and get

1476
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,760
confused and walk around for hours and feel very tired and then wake up and then stand up

1477
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:09,920
and...

1478
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,420
You need food, man.

1479
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,700
I gotta get some food because maybe...

1480
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,980
I need water is probably what I really need to try.

1481
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,840
We got to go.

1482
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,940
We'll see you later.

1483
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,200
That's it, Gil.

1484
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,800
Do you have a cigarette?

1485
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,620
It goes out like that.

1486
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,100
Not with a bang, but with a whimper.

1487
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,020
Oh, that.

1488
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,080
Keep your hat on tight.

1489
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,740
You're back to the wind.

1490
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,600
You're sacking the saddle.

1491
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,200
See y'all.

1492
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,660
Get that sack to Princess Wayne.

1493
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,080
Ha!

1494
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,560
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

1495
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,160
We'll see you later.

1496
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,480
We'll see you later.

1497
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,080
We'll see you later.

1498
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,080
We'll see you later.

1499
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,920
We'll see you later.

1500
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,280
We'll see you later.

1501
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,700
We'll see you later.

1502
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,000
We'll see you later.

1503
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,560
We'll see you later.

1504
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1505
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1506
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1507
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1508
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1509
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:13,560


1510
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,420
Next year, I want more.

1511
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,040
More flirting.

1512
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,260
More time off.

1513
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,200
More money.

1514
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,360
You'll be under constant surveillance.

1515
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,160
If you see anyone unknown to us

1516
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,680
or contact anyone

1517
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,280
for any reason whatsoever,

1518
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,640
you will be murdered.

1519
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,360
We'll meet again at midnight.
