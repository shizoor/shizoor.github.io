1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
What is that red button over there, dear?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,680
Go ahead, please.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,740
Once upon a time, in a famous story,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,440
a girl named Alice got very curious about a little white rabbit who passed by.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,520
She followed him and soon found herself falling down a very deep hole

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,460
into a strange place called Wonderland.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,620
This is the voice of Colossus.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
The voice of God.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,580
The choice is yours.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,880
Obey and live, or disobey and die.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,280
Quiet, numbskulls. I'm broadcasting.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,720
The Salt Juice.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,400
The only truth in the world.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,460
The only truth in the world.

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,180
The higher epopt of the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,620
As everyone knows, J.R. Bob Dobbs is probably man's only path to salvation in these end times.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,000
Seen here in the Visitron at the age of four.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,100
Okay.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,060
Okay.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,980
This is secret puzzling evidence.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,480
That's right.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,980
Once again.

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,700
Again, secretly famous here on KPMA.

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,680
Paleo-Lithio treatment coming up for those of you who really want it.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,780
And look for the big black tube around you.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,540
Please.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,860
And now, here he is.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,760
The star of our country.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,140
Bob.

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,660
Bob.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,240
Now, at last.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,380
Bob.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,900
Bob.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,200
Bob.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,380
Bob.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,820
Bob.

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,380
Bob.

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,940
Bob.

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


45
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


48
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


49
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


50
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


51
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


52
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


53
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


54
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


55
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


56
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


57
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


58
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


59
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


60
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


61
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,940


62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,980
No.

63
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Not me.

64
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,600
His lips aren't moving.

65
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,760
But he's looking at me and he's saying to me.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,660
Good morning.

67
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,680
What's your money?

68
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,640
Okay, you got it.

69
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,160
What's your address?

70
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
My address is...

71
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,220
Okay, thanks, guys.

72
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,520
Okay.

73
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,040
There we go.

74
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,920
Thank you.

75
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,260
Okay.

76
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,180
Smooth as pie.

77
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
Look out, Paul!

78
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,860
Well, we got rid of one.

79
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,480
There goes the piano.

80
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,980
Phil's next.

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,380
Hello?

82
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,060
Okay.

83
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,980
Okay, Phil, stand up in front of this car right now.

84
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,220
Don't worry about the rushing headlights.

85
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Wait.

86
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm not...

87
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm not in the room with a listener.

88
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,240
No, it's all right.

89
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,320
Put the listener back in your pocket.

90
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,360
No, it doesn't matter.

91
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,980
The listeners are expendable.

92
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
The listeners are expendable.

93
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,900
The listeners are expendable.

94
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,820
You don't know what's really going on in the rooms today.

95
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,560
Minds are vapid.

96
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,740
Like that gray cloud floating over your head right now.

97
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,600
They're one minute and they're the next minute.

98
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,920
They're luminous and sometimes too liquid for most of us.

99
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,020
I gotta work it off with a coffee stein.

100
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,760
Sometimes I hang around the gym for hours without...

101
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,580
Well, you know, once they take off breathing apparatuses, it's fair game, fair game, fair game.

102
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,160
Anybody, anybody.

103
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,860
There's no control factor.

104
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,720
Just get that off.

105
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,120
Because we really love to make a stash.

106
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,460
Mr. High Capper, don't make me touch your mind.

107
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,060
Because we really love to make a stash.

108
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,840
Bang, bang.

109
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,480
Mr. High Capper, don't make me touch your mind.

110
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,060
Bang, bang.

111
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,020
Because we really love to...

112
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,600
Defy.

113
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,220
I'm in the gang.

114
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,840
Gang called the stash.

115
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,520
G-G's, don't fit a mother in your stash.

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Fucking creeps, robbery, gang called the stash.

117
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,200
G-G's, don't fit a mother in your no-sauce.

118
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,240
Rolling clean, cause I made a mainstay.

119
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,080
Now I'm high, get the bag.

120
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,860
G-G's, don't fit a mother in your no-sauce.

121
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,480
Get the bag.

122
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,860
Break, drag, drag, drag.

123
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,960
It's a mobster, mobster.

124
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,540
Don't go stuck on that shit.

125
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,180
Oh, I gotta make a stash.

126
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,180
G-G's, don't fit a mother in your stash.

127
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm in the gang.

128
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,740
Gang called the stash.

129
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,300
G-G's, don't fit a mother in your stash.

130
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,780
I gotta make a stash.

131
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,820
Ah, yes, dear friends.

132
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,020
I gotta make a stash.

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,420
Ah, yes.

134
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,920
Thinking how I could've get some dead friends a stash.

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,580
Lord Infamous making a stash, dear friends.

136
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,780
This is a test.

137
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,740
For the next 60 seconds, this station will conduct a test

138
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,640
of the emergency...

139
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Emergency broadcast.

140
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,860
Ah, yes.

141
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,880
This is only a test.

142
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
I need guidance, great one.

143
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,020
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

144
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,960
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

145
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
Can you not verify a fact?

146
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,640
I recommend the bottom.

147
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,020
Are you people insane?

148
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
No, no, I'm just a transvestite.

149
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,760
What's the matter?

150
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
Ah, and there will be more, more, more of that

151
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,780
happy flying, dear friends, from the trans Connie,

152
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,700
uh,

153
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,020
from Reverend Pro-Tatrix and the other, uh, ho...

154
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll be your test pilot tonight, dear friends.

155
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,460
Here we go.

156
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,620
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll be your pilot on this special subgenius science show.

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,040
And, uh, our original intro that you heard at the beginning

159
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,440
was by W.G. Wilco, Roger Wilco there.

160
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,480
We're gonna fly so high, high, high with Bob,

161
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,940
with old Bob Dobbs.

162
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,120
We're gonna be flying, flying, baby.

163
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,200
And it's, it's slack and, and sex.

164
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,380
And that's what this is all about.

165
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,480
And the interior movie dialogue clip collages that we'll hear,

166
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,600
many are by the great new Monet,

167
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,820
who's new from alt-binary slack.

168
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,460
And there's a bunch of old remastered secret puzzling evidence.

169
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,360
And Dr. Howell rocketing away and flying high

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,440
on the subgenius show from Media Barrage 12,

171
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,980
our new old CD.

172
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,840
Fasten your seat belts, friends,

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,300
cause that's from KPFA in Berkeley.

174
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,860
That's crazy hippie stuff.

175
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,900
And as always, friends, lonesome cowboy Dave,

176
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,020
Professor Chaz Smith, the Rocketeer,

177
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,060
and me, uh, liver than I am now,

178
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
friends, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

179
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,460
I want to be a test pilot.

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
Want to be a test pilot.

181
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,340
Friends, we've all been test pilots for Bob.

182
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,300
And we're gonna talk about how early humans were a test pilot for subgeniuses.

183
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,840
And there's gonna be songs by Glass Madness and, and, and The Button.

184
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,580
The Button, dear friends.

185
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,340
Climaxing in classic forbidden science lecture that you won't believe.

186
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,180
Ah, yes.

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,900
Want to be a test pilot.

188
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,020
Want to be the best pilot.

189
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,840
Want to fly much faster than sound.

190
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,260
Want to be the best pilot.

191
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,260


192
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay, comes in goblet stangs for most of us here

193
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,960
on the Reverend Ivan Stang Surf Show.

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,560
He's subgenius surf.

195
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,700
We don't really even have a name for him.

196
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,140
Beach Party.

197
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,760
Subgenius Beach Party.

198
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,520
Channel 162 in Mendocino.

199
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,320
Subgenius Beach Party.

200
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,040
And, uh, well, we've got some footage.

201
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,180
We'd like to show you some arm edge and some hand edge.

202
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,040
But we can't show it until the preparations are made.

203
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,060
Someone with a mortuary hat or some other kind of thing.

204
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
Oh, look.

205
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,620
He's shooting the tits.

206
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,520
Wow, look at Bob handle that curl.

207
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,380
Friends, don't you wish you knew where the subgenius bench party is.

208
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,140
You know, there's someone calling, but I can't put him on the air.

209
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't know what...

210
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,480
Does that mean the caller's on the air or just waiting now to not be on the air?

211
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't know. See, I'm not...

212
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,820
I don't have the great power of the Chaz, man.

213
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,880
I'll just push buttons here.

214
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,000
Now, what if you go speaker?

215
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,580
I'm just pushing red buttons.

216
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm pushing all the red buttons.

217
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,380
Wow.

218
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,500
Whoa, look what that button did.

219
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,480
Cool.

220
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,540
Now we can't get back up, man.

221
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:17,620
Man?

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,020
There's the fun button.

223
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,040
That's not 15 feet.

224
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,960
I can't see any light up there, Harvey.

225
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,520
God, man.

226
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,120
I can't work...

227
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
None of the other buttons work at all now.

228
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, man.

229
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,260
Look, all the other buttons are...

230
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,320
The doors are all closed.

231
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,940
Deactivated.

232
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Did you notice all the doors are all closed and they're like vacuum sealing?

233
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,060
Whoa.

234
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,460
Yes.

235
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,840
Yep.

236
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,080
It's just been a heck of a war so far here.

237
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,520
We're trying to march all the Slack squads back to their barracks.

238
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,680
Now they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,740
They get belligerent late at night, but they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks here.

240
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,000
Look, they've started now.

241
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,940
This is what we call the monster beach party.

242
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,060
Hey, well, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

243
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,940
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

244
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,400
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

245
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,900
And don't you wish you did.

246
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,940
Oh, dear. That ding.

247
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,280
Felt great.

248
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Well, Dr. Hal, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us about the relationship between the demopods and the...

249
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,520
Well, the demopods and the mirrors.

250
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,520


251
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,520


252
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,520


253
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,100
The demopods got together at the early...

254
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,660
No, the demopods and us-a-pods.

255
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,140
Oh, the demopods.

256
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,120
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
I didn't understand that.

258
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,820
I thought you meant this script right here, the one with the red lines on the cover.

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,720
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

260
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,380
I never believe anything with red dots.

261
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,360
It says read addresses that I don't like on the show.

262
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,220
Gosh, I'm coming in from all sides.

263
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,380
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

264
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,740
It was obvious that during the game they should not have launched ahead with that size of a rocket.

265
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,380
They should have used a smaller rocket, not hurt so many people.

266
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,620
The small bore.

267
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,480
Some, perhaps, but not so many.

268
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:55,340
As it turned out, JFK was turning to Governor Connolly to tell him the name of the band that dare not speak his name, and was shot because of that.

269
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:03,800
And officers, both plainclothes and uniformed, seemed to spring from everywhere at once, guns drawn, ordering people to lie flat.

270
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:14,000
There are two witnesses who were near the president's car at the time of the explosions who say that shots were fired from which upper window, we do not know.

271
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,420
Lieutenant said there was something unnatural about the conditions.

272
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,500
Lieutenant said there was something unnatural about the conditions.

273
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,500


274
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,500


275
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,340
There was.

276
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,240
It was shriveled.

277
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
Is there any danger that the egg might hatch?

278
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,940
Oh, no. The temperature is just low enough to keep it from hatching.

279
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,720
As long as this knob is set so that the temperature remains constant, there'll be no problem.

280
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
Whatever you says, master. Your wish is my command.

281
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,420
You mean that only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these, these monsters?

282
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,700
Why are you putting makeup on your ass?

283
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,680
She says the monster came out of the sewer and ate her grandfather.

284
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,780
You figure it out.

285
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,480
You may not know, but there's NRC men crawling around the country, and they're all wearing masks.

286
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,940
They're all wearing masks.

287
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,180
I mean, something's gone wrong, and it's so bad, nobody wants to talk about it.

288
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,520
The cops are going nuts trying to figure out why a bag lady wants a handgun.

289
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:06,540
Now, speaking of hair-covered monster babes, there was also a movie in the late 50s called The Neanderthal Man, which I saw when I was a kid.

290
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,460
And it really impressed me because the cops broke in and they found photographs of the mad scientist.

291
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,080
Real Neanderthals having sex.

292
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,460
The mad scientist had been experimenting on his Mexican mask.

293
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:17,720
And, you know, they saw the kind of mask he had made.

294
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:25,960
And there were a series of photographs that showed her as a nice-looking young lady and then gradually reverting into a Neanderthal.

295
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
He had a devolution drug or something.

296
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,800
Which, of course, we've all been seeking our whole lives, many of us.

297
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,400
Well, we're looking for Herschendt women, if that's what you mean.

298
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,260
Well, either one.

299
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,580
You know, one or the other or both would be the best.

300
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,140
That leads back to lycanthropy again.

301
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,860
But not Herschendt.

302
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,920
No, it's not the hairiness that's the kick.

303
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,800
It was the prognathous jaw.

304
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,740
The jaw, the sloping brow, the heavy brow ridge, the increased...

305
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,220
The lupine, elven neck bones.

306
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,600
The heavy muscle structure.

307
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,760
The strong yet archy neuronucleoid pieces of flesh hanging from the...

308
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,700
The difference that turns you on.

309
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,100
Just a difference, huh?

310
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,400
Well, but it was a major, major difference.

311
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,880
I just see you, like, chasing, like, these weird, like, poor war veteran guys and stuff from 1942 and everything around the block.

312
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,220
And, like, grabbing them and...

313
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,740
Oh, there they go now!

314
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,220
Those funny-looking dudes.

315
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,720
White canes.

316
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,540
Someone wearing the DAV bracelets around their necks.

317
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,480
And it looks so much like dog collars.

318
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,600
She loves a monkey's uncle.

319
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,600
Call us a couple of missing links.

320
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,600
She loves a monkey's uncle.

321
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,680
Love all his monkey shines.

322
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,720
Every day is Valentine's.

323
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,400
I love the monkey's uncle and the monkey's uncle's eight for me.

324
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,840
Eight for me.

325
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,420
She loves a monkey's uncle, yeah, yeah.

326
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,440
She loves a monkey's uncle, whoa, whoa.

327
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,980
She loves a monkey's uncle.

328
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,120
And the monkey's uncle.

329
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,060
The monkey's uncle's eight for me.

330
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Kissing my heart jumps like a clown.

331
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,160
She loves a monkey's uncle.

332
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,120
Feels like the circus just came to town.

333
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,140
She loves a monkey's uncle.

334
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,220
I live in a jungle gym.

335
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,100
Woo!

336
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,620
In order to be with him.

337
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,240
I love the monkey's uncle and I wish I were the monkey's aunt.

338
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,580
Monkey's aunt.

339
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,060
The monkey's uncle likes him.

340
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,520
The monkey's uncle wants to have a game with her.

341
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,840
The monkey's uncle wears Tillys coughing pants on the monitor.

342
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,960
классical

343
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,520
Whoa-woah-woah-woah

344
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,760
On the day he marries me

345
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,700
What a muddy family tree

346
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,200
Nice paint.

347
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,860
A groom, a chimpanzee.

348
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,480
Let them say he's the booby cries.

349
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,640
She loves the monkey's uncle.

350
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,700
He's the guy I idolize.

351
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,620
She loves the monkey's uncle.

352
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,680
Love all his monkey shines.

353
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
Every day is Valentine's.

354
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,420
I love the monkey's uncle and the monkey's uncle's eight for me.

355
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,840
Eight for me.

356
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,960
Uh-huh, I love the monkey's uncle.

357
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,980
I love the monkey's uncle.

359
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,000
I love the monkey's uncle.

360
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,180
And I'm mad about his chimpanzee.

361
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,580
Chaz, I understand you were at some sort of a convention,

363
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,080
the Stone Hand Axe Convention, was it?

364
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,880
You had to dress like a woman and carry a stone.

365
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,660
Titanium tools they're making now.

366
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,780
By hand, right?

367
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,940
With those little, they smelt them by themselves in a little shack in the back.

368
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,600
Were these like scrapers and choppers and, and, uh,

369
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,440
or was it the new, new modern day hand axes?

370
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,880
Were there scruffers and scribes?

371
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,740
Or were there people who worked with their hands and feet like a mom and a dad?

372
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,440
People were taking pictures of them.

373
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,260
Going.

374
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,860
Ooh.

375
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

376
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,320
Were there little homo habilis people working and chipping away at the church and Flint?

377
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,120
Were there little homunculi working away in the dark basements of the...

378
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,780
There were monkeys with apples on their backs all over the place.

379
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,500
Monkeys with apples on their backs?

380
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:50,820
Yeah.

381
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
See, that's the new word for...

382
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,100
Applebacks, we were calling them.

383
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,700
That's a new word for a gyrating, um, um, junkie.

384
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,480
That's a new word for a person like what they used to have a gorilla on their sidecar.

385
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,740
No, they're just mac monkeys.

386
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,540
A bunch of mac apes.

387
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,780
Mac apes.

388
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm one of them.

389
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm a mac ape.

390
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,920
That means in, in, uh, Celtic, that means son of the ape.

391
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm still...

392
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:23,480
I die now, my son, but someday there will be a man with something in his mouth from which smoke comes,

393
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,940
like the fire on this sacred mountain.

394
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,420
I am weak, my dear son, but I tell you that this man will be named...

395
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory predicted the coming of Marlboro Man as a leader in the future.

396
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,920
Marlboro Man operated with these crude stones.

397
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,020
Marlboro Man implemented to pound the tobacco and roll the papers,

398
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,880
which gave his caves and habitations this distinctive odor.

399
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,920
Okay, I suppose that explains it. Thank you.

400
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
You know, that's how mankind started out.

401
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,680
In the plains of Africa, in the old Dubai gorge.

402
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,840
It's now a gorge. It used to be just a light side.

403
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,820
And now a gorge?

404
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,960
That was the song of the Australopithecus and Homo habilis.

405
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,360
What was the allegorge of the Homo habilis?

406
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:24,520
The allegorge was, do not step on moist rock five million years from hence.

407
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,480
You know, I was reading a Martian paleoanthropology book, and they...

408
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,580
Dr. Zorg.

409
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,120
Dr. Zorg's book.

410
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,920
Actually, it was by Dr. Shreve right here in Cleveland and Dr. Johansson, Lucy's child.

411
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,680
And they were...

412
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
Buster Poindexter's brother.

413
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:52,380
They were suggesting that perhaps human intelligence evolved in concert with our society.

414
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,420
A complete and total lie.

415
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,120
We became the apes that conquered our environment.

416
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Yes, friends.

417
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,720
Because we had our own selves.

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,060
So dear to us in our memory.

419
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,460
Our own society.

420
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Our own human and private ape society.

421
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
As our own worst enemy.

422
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,620
That's it.

423
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,640
Our own fate of each other was what drove us to evolve such demonic cleverness.

424
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,880
You think they're demonically clever?

425
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,980
Your pronouncements are yet so hollow to me.

426
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,840
I cannot...

427
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,560
You say in one breath...

428
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,260
Yetis are president.

429
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,300
I don't consider that man a man of yeti blood.

430
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,180
I consider him a spurlish, a curlish...

431
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,700
A pink.

432
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,440
A human.

433
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,120
A naive.

434
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
A pure human.

435
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,660
And an escaped lab rat.

436
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,700
George W. Bush might as well be an escaped lab rat.

437
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,900
helpedimdlea&t

438
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,740
Or Auntie Betty bleep.

439
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,120
Dunkey talk to him!

440
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
We like confetti.

441
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,560
Sister lech Kyovskaya needs Melissa Keeley.

442
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,420
Dorit still can't believe she has longoria.

443
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,420


444
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,740
You could really have turned in以前 bureau!

445
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:58,820
It's fine,apersaw!

446
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,820


447
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,820


448
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,880
Oh, says Senator Les Schuck.

449
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Merry Christmas, everybody!

450
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:13,220
I do love to tightly talklady into Leelyn Gortberg's world-書k prestiques.

451
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,100
He's Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

452
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,800
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

453
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,100
He is the head of the subgenius church, and he is super cool.

454
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,120
What happens if I push that button?

455
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,560
I don't know what happens if you pass that button, but I know if you pass that button.

456
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,520
There's these little lights on the phone, and I'm...

457
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,140
I push the red button, but...

458
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,260
Well, as you notice, staying over there to the left of the grill...

459
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,700
And here's the util phone.

460
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,860
It says speaker and phone, so I think someone is importantly trying to convocate us,

461
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,200
but we can't evacuate the system.

462
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,700
Hello?

463
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,140
Hello.

464
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,120
No, I get it.

465
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,920
Push one and pull the other one at the same time.

466
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,940
Hey, man, you're blowing my FCC qualifications.

467
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,680
Let's quit talking.

468
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,500
Let's not even...

469
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,080
No, we were just kidding about the collar there.

470
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,280
Let's not use the word blowing anything of anything you have in any contextual situation, please.

471
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,500
For the love of Dobbs.

472
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,220
And whatever happened to Mike?

473
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,860
For the love of Mike.

474
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,660
For the love of Mike.

475
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,800
For the love of money.

476
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,500
For the...

477
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,560
Is she singing about Buddha again?

478
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,880
Let's see.

479
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,820
Ima Sumac here.

480
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,800
Buddha's my kind of guy.

481
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,220
This is a song called Akhla Taki.

482
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,880
Chant of the Chosen Maidens.

483
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,780
These are your Neanderthal babes, your Yeti girls, your rare women.

484
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,340
They're going to be taken to the sacrificial rock and rocked by the...

485
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,920
And I suppose the priestly class will have some sort of fun with them

486
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,880
because they were captured and enslaved from a local tribe that lost the big bowling tournament.

487
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,840
Right?

488
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,840
Am I correct?

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,700
That's all right.

490
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:09,880
Yeah.

491
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,420
Well, that's...

492
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,220
Isn't that the way they used to do it down there in Peru?

493
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,280
Yes, the conspiracy actually echoes down through human history.

494
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,740
Just as today we suffer under its sometimes subtle jackboot, so too did the ancient...

495
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,960
Subtle jackboot.

496
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,900
The Lemurians, the Atlanteans also knew of the conspiracy.

497
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,600
But don't you think subtle jackboot would be a delicious name for a band that could perform not one but three songs?

498
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,220
Oh, I got a...

499
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,980
No, no.

500
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,400
Subtle jackboot is a good name for a band.

501
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,400


502
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,660
It's a good name for a band.

503
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,320
Princess, we and I have formed a new band just because we had the name.

504
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,540
Subtle jerkwaters.

505
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
The jerk...

506
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,240
Okay, here's the band name.

507
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,600
Okay.

508
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,600
Poo Water Towel.

509
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,840
I already thought of that.

510
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,260
Oh.

511
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,580
That's old, man.

512
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,520
Poo Water Towel.

513
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:56,960
Come on.

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,480
I said...

515
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,780
I had Poo Water...

516
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,140
There probably was a band called Poo Water Towel.

517
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,000
There was Poo Water Dishonins.

518
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,220
It was an old 19...

519
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,080
Early 70s Cleveland band, art band.

520
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,080
Poo Water Dishonins.

521
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,620
Really?

522
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,140
Yes.

523
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,500
And they played...

524
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,200
Yes.

525
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,940
High frequency dog tones, mostly.

526
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,080
But they were bursted by the ASPIC...

527
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,520
The Society for Refurbishment of the Animal Crew.

528
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,600
And one man was sent to punishment for, I think, like 40 years.

529
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,480
My God.

530
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:39,940
My God.

531
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,000
My God.

532
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,360
What happened?

533
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,220
He's dead.

534
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,220
Peppy's been killed.

535
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Peppy's been killed.

536
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,060
My God.

537
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,780
What happened?

538
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,860
He's dead.

539
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,860
Peppy's been killed.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,780
He's been killed.

541
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
He's been killed.

542
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,500
Peppy's been killed.

543
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,520
I love this world.

544
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,160
Peppy's been killed.

545
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,980
What kind of place is this?

546
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
My God.

547
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,780
What kind of place is this?

548
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,240
What could have done it?

549
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,960
Was he a...

550
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,560
Probably some animal from the desert.

551
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:07,880
Oh, my God.

552
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,300
It was probably some animal from the desert.

553
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,660
I see.

554
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:12,920
I see.

555
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,040
This place must be full of them.

556
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,960
Are you talking about my dog?

557
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,900
Where's my dog?

558
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Peppy?

559
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,200
That bird is extraterrestrial.

560
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,820
It comes from outer space.

561
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,340
From some God-forsaken antimatter galaxy.

562
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,400
Millions and millions of like years from the Earth.

563
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,180
And the Lord said,

564
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Let children laugh.

565
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
The Lord said,

566
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,840
Let children laugh.

567
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,940
The Lord said,

568
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,520
Laugh.

569
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,700
Children laugh.

570
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,820
The Lord said,

571
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,540
Laugh.

572
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,780
Laugh. Laugh.

573
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,500
The more you mess with this bird,

574
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,100
the more your nozzle gets.

575
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,580
The longer the nozzle gets,

576
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,300
the stronger the armature, Dr. Peppy.

577
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Remember when you were playing...

578
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,240
Why did you say that?

579
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,820
What did you say?

580
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,380
What made you say that, Dr. Peppy?

581
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
I want you to be the greatest trumpet turner

582
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,180
in all of the world.

583
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,300
What do you know about Dr. Peppy?

584
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,360
Dr. Peppy, calm down.

585
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,020
Just take off the mouthpiece.

586
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,300
There you're going to hurt someone.

587
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,480
You're not supposed to do that there.

588
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,440
It's a stinky, stinky place.

589
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,060
What do you know about Dr. Peppy and his button?

590
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
Don't press the button!

591
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,780
Dr. Peppy's button was

592
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,340
the most important turning point in my life.

593
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,520
Seeing the button go and swirl and grow

594
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,820
and become one with the rest of the audience.

595
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm going to get you into a state of silence.

596
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,720
Without really just a bit.

597
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,740
This is the discarnate voice of Dr. Don Peppy,

598
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,700
the most...

599
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,880
...sensible...

600
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,360
Don't ever push anything with red lights on it.

601
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,780
Don't touch the things with red lights on them.

602
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,040
Hello, I'm Dr. Amano Leo Peppy,

603
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,760
Dr. Amano's daughter,

604
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
the child of the world's most powerful...

605
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,120
...soul.

606
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Whoa!

607
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,740
This is the angel.

608
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,280
Wow.

609
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,400
Looks like a dead squid.

610
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,740
And he somehow, someway,

611
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,960
perhaps maybe bring it back.

612
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,820
And suddenly...

613
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,540
I saw a flying saucer.

614
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Saucer?

615
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,840
You mean the kind from up there?

616
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,740
Yeah, well, it's gone apart.

617
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,640
And did you report it?

618
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,240
Yeah.

619
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,760
I radioed in immediately,

620
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,400
and they said,

621
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,740
we'll keep it quiet until you land.

622
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,460
And as soon as we landed,

623
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,420
big army brass grabbed us

624
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,660
and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.

625
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,140
Oh, it burns me up.

626
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,700
These things have been seen for years.

627
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
They're here. It's a fact.

628
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,960
And the public ought to know about it.

629
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,140
There must be something more you can do about it.

630
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,100
Oh, there isn't.

631
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
All but what's the use of making a fuss?

632
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,360
But last night I saw a flying ardu.

633
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,280
They couldn't have possibly been from this planet.

634
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,820
But I can't say a word.

635
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,380
A muzzle by army brass.

636
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
I can't even admit I saw the thing.

637
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:18,900
The...

638
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,140
It is not so that...

639
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,180
Good morning and welcome to the subgenius devotional hour here.

640
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,740
Um...

641
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,460
Before the normal scary time.

642
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever.

643
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,580
That was a stink-all.

644
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,400
But it had lots of prophecy involved.

645
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,400
You heard it right here on the subgenius hour.

646
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,060
And lots of funny stories.

647
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,060


648
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,060


649
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,060


650
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,460
A few words.

651
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,320
Wonder why Fido came home with his wazoo missing.

652
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,720
Or wonder why those beefs like Buster and Bill

653
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,000
out in the parlor and the pasture are lying out there with their throats and half their rectums missing.

654
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,320
Well, it's because of those exists who came down to this earth one Christmas day many millennia ago

655
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,720
to forge a new link.

656
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,340
One might call it a hot link.

657
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Between the aliens and man.

658
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,560
A giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe.

659
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,080
The galactic center.

660
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,020
Those little tykes will be able to carry on for us.

661
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,220
Every one of those little kids is a potential Lee Majors.

662
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,300
And I hope you're pleased with what we've done.

663
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,700
The rising generations shall have reason to praise us.

664
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,160
To pour out libations on our smoking altars.

665
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,360
And we shall know this is a non-smoking section.

666
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,920
The book of the subgenius.

667
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
Lunatic prophecies for the coming weird times.

668
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,900
Out now and on your stand.

669
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,020
Out now and on your stand.

670
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Complain.

671
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,420
Loudly agitate and tell the store if necessary.

672
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,800
They are crazy.

673
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,000
They are crazy.

674
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,860
It's a question of bull dada.

675
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,820
And its application, of course, in the society surrounding the bull dada.

676
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,920
We apply it from a little disposable tube.

677
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,600
That's right.

678
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,620
Using the power shell and using the spirit code,

679
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,140
the Yakatizu Matrix applies the bull dada to the normals and pinks.

680
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,240
Time for tubby bye-bye.

681
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,660
Time for tubby bye-bye.

682
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,120
I hate this job.

683
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,460
Die, arrogant earth scum.

684
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720

685
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,080
You piece of cock and bastard.

Catch him now, you slippery trick.

687
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,320
No!

688
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,780
Take refuge in the throat.

689
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,820
Take refuge in the throat.

690
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,740
You bastard.

691
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,160
You piece of cock and bastard.

692
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,180
You piece of cock and bastard.

693
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,080
No!

694
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,020
You piece of portfolio.

695
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,400
You piece of autpad.

696
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:56,760

You have sealed your fate.

You have sealed your fate.

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,820
Adios, you sick and blocking little stinker.

710
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,200
You have made me very angry.

711
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
Very angry indeed.

712
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,160
Of course, you realize this means war.

713
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,960
Oh no, we're all doomed.

714
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,060
Launch authorization received.

Fear clutches my breath.

719
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
Launch in progress.

720
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,740
Launch in progress.

721
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,020
Oh crap, these computers, they're so naughty and so complex.

722
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,240
I could pitch them.

723
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,540

724
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,220

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,000
Ah!

726
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,060
You're in for a few.

727
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,580
Stop the projection.

728
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,980
You have sealed your fate.

729
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:15,220
You have sealed your fate.

730
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,060
This is my body.

731
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,180
This is my body.

732
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,020
As I was saying, Buster, this planet ain't there enough for the two of us.

733
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,320
Oh, off you go!

734
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,480
Oh, off you go!

735
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,880
Get down.

736
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:43,880


737
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:43,880


738
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,160
I'm sorry, this is just my personal advantage.

739
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,640
Next time, guys, go live with yer dog.

740
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:45,800
Bшr!

741
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,600
Some bad and boring talk.

742
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,460
The world is, at best, a maw Buch.

743
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:54,620


744
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:54,620


745
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,020
The last thing I want is a quarrel.

746
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,180
You can't eat a dog!

747
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,580
Always on the top of your system.

748
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Heck, I'm a worm!

749
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,100


750
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,960
Let's dig heads!

751
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,820
This doesn't sound like such a good idea.

752
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,120
Oh, friends.

753
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,640
It's.

754
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,120
So it's so insane.

755
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,020
And that because when come the saucers, then there comes slack.

756
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,240
That piece was by the bishop.

757
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,280
Is that amazing?

758
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,680
Friends, happy, happy flying.

759
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,620
Ah, yes.

760
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:09,540
At this very moment, there have been stories filtering into the studio about other sports events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet.

761
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,140
That's right. These are aliens from another planet kidnapping our American sports teams.

762
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,800
It's not a legal problem.

763
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
It's not a political problem.

764
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,420
It's an alien problem.

765
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,520
Oh, I've never seen one.

766
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,780
You know, the visits from aliens need not be a painful item.

767
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,400
It can be quite an exciting time.

768
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,400
I don't personally have any desire to have it.

769
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,240
It's like meeting Bob.

770
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,360
I don't want to do it.

771
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:43,640
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the Church of the Subgenius and the the organized crime fighting that we're doing here.

772
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,980
In California.

773
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,080
There's... Could I, uh...

774
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,420
Just you and some of this. Thank you.

775
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,820
Yes.

776
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,720
Squeeze my ass.

777
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah, just...

778
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,680
What I need to know is...

779
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
Don't squeeze mine, though. Put it... Stop that.

780
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,840
We are, uh... We are drinking warm liquids out of animal containers here.

781
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,500
We'll be looking forward to, uh...

782
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,360
Subgenius Foundation will release the truth about the so-called ancient astronauts real soon on this show.

783
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,440
Medical proof of the work instinct will be coming up also.

784
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,660
Oh. Oh, my.

785
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,920
He's checking her for her foot gland.

786
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,920
Oh, my. I can't watch this.

787
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,180
Punch up five for me, please. Thanks.

788
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,560
Yeah, thanks.

789
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,260
My video's a little bit strange.

790
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,160
We're going to go right now to another song by Glass Madness on... Here on Live Tape.

791
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,120
In the studio.

792
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,300
Whatcha gonna sing about at five o'clock in the morning?

793
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,920
Ooh-hoo!

794
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,500
Talking about five dogs in the church, everything in a whole big mess on the floor.

795
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,120
Just like a disorganized first church, a disorganized mess on the floor.

796
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,120
You're a little intimidated.

797
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,640
By joining any kind of church, you can call the church anything you want.

798
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,460
Foundation.

799
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,240
Or a club.

800
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,120
Or a...

801
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,880
Just something to look at.

802
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,940
We call it Church of the Fill-in-the-Blank.

803
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,940
And Bob Dobbs is the biggest blank to fill in you'll ever see.

804
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,320
And that's all it is.

805
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,580
Friends and neighbors out there listening tonight, we hope that you're putting your hands on the radio

806
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,940
and getting the full impact of this message that's coming down to you here.

807
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,500
Face at the very fact of your eyes, moving across the page at this very moment as you try to read your radio

808
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,720
is inevitably and sub-atomically decreed.

809
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,340
Your brain is working without your control.

810
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,440
You are locked into the machinations of a cosmic puppeteer who wants to...

811
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,560
You worked your strings so skillfully you never knew they were there.

812
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,420
Until now.

813
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,300
Feels good, doesn't it?

814
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, it feels so very good when I've got the strings bolt tight.

815
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,300
Oh!

816
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,840
But we can show you where the strings are attached and how to sync up with the puppeteer.

817
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,860
Will this say life after death, reincarnality, psychic powers, immortality, invisibility,

818
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,560
nirvana, communications, higher challenges, slack, slack, slack, so on.

819
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,660
The Little Altar for Bob Dobbs.

820
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,040
Bob Dobbs.

821
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,080
The Little Altar for Bob Dobbs.

822
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,960
The Little Altar for Bob Dobbs.

823
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,600
Bob Dobbs.

824
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,420
He has left this world, but he is with us always.

825
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,540
No matter where we go, he is with us.

826
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,780
Dead?

827
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,560
No madam not dead the way you know it.

828
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,040
He is with us always.

829
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,260
In the freezer.

830
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,980
Not dead the way you know it.

831
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,680
He is with us always.

832
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,540
We got some poodle meat in the freezer.

833
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,520
We got some poodle meat in the freezer for you.

834
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,460
We got some poodle meat in the freezer.

835
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,960
We got to remember the words of the pearl.

836
00:36:46,100 --> 00:37:09,920
We got to remember the words of the pearl.

837
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,560
We got to remember the words of the pearl.

838
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:53,660
We got to remember the words of the pearl.

839
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,280
We got to remember the words of the pearl.

840
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:47,140
Are you ready to spank it in exuberance or just sit there and cry and dribble tears

841
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,940
all over that profound little thing?

842
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,980
We love children.

843
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,680
Chaz hath told they live in love or live in nectarines.

844
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,240
Chaz hath also told they that to lie to thy mother is to lie not only to thy father but

845
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,300
thy own self.

846
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,880
Thy own self.

847
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,300
Thy own self.

848
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,420
Thy own self.

849
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,200
This is a test.

850
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,940
For the next 60 seconds, you can choose.

851
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,980
will conduct a test of the emergency broadcast system.

852
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,220
This is only a test.

853
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,180
I need Biden's great one.

854
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,340
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

855
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,300
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

856
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,660
Can you not verify a fact?

857
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,980
I recommend the bottom.

858
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,360
Are you people insane?

859
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,300
No, no, I'm just a transvestite.

860
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,740
What's the matter? Have you ever seen a man take off a dress before?

861
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,660
Look, that kid's got blisters.

862
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,500
I need you, transvestite. I need you, transvestite.

863
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,040
She's a drag, a well-known drag.

864
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,900
Your choice is simple.

865
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,880
Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course in face obliteration.

866
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,580
Then let me be a slaving Sodom.

867
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,260
Let me too, if it means perfumes and silks like these.

868
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,160
Hey, my pantyhose!

869
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,000
Your choice is simple.

870
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,900
Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course in face obliteration.

871
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,420
I need Biden's great one.

872
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,140
I recommend a lobotomy.

873
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh!

874
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,780
My ovaries.

875
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,780
Hebrews and Sodomites, greetings.

876
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,200
Take me now.

877
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,600
We extend the hospitality of our city.

878
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,620
Take me now, sub-creature.

879
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,880
He is cute.

880
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,840
No, no, I'm just a transvestite.

881
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,520
Come to my room right after dinner.

882
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,580
I'll let you wear my underwear.

883
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,040
You are a lady from the ground up.

884
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,680
Give this man satin undies, a dress, a sweater, and a skirt,

885
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,080
or even the lounging outfit he has on,

886
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,940
and he's the happiest man in the world.

887
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:39,940


888
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,380
Naturally, you'd know I was wearing my special super thermal D long underwear.

889
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,140
He can work better, think better, he can play better,

890
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:49,940
and he can be more of a credit to his community and his government because he is happy.

891
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,340
These things are his comfort.

892
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,640
Don't you know the difference between a boy and a girl?

893
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,920
I assume my friend Gen the Sun was a boy.

894
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Excuse me, does this look like a boy to you?

895
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,260
Don't you know the difference between a boy and a girl?

896
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,760
I assume my friend Gen the Sun was a boy.

897
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,320
Gentlemen, does this look like a boy to you?

898
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,120
Doug, you're lacking.

899
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,920
Please, I wish you'd stop being a boy.

900
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


901
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


902
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,140
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems very apparent, it seems quite unequivocal.

903
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,120
We, all of us, we are in hell.

904
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,960
God help us.

905
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
We are in hell.

906
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,720
We are in hell.

907
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,600
They love least that they know their love.

908
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,900
Maids say no to love.

909
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,420
They would have priest-trued eyes.

910
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,760
I follow my love into the depths of hell itself.

911
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,640
I want to be a woman.

912
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,760
Love, American style.

913
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,860
Truer than the red, white, and blue.

914
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,220
I want to be a woman.

915
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,220
Are you a boy or a girl?

916
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:01,720
Are you a boy or a girl?

917
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,540
Gentlemen, Doug, you're lacking.

918
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,620
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl or a boy.

919
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,720
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl or a boy.

920
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:09,880
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl or a boy.

921
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,500
I'm just asking whether a minute.

922
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,620
Are you a boy or a girl?

923
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,500
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

924
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,020
Okay, so you were born as a man but you feel that you're really a woman.

925
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,280
Okay, so you were born as a man but you feel that you're really a woman.

926
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,360
I don't remember how to behave around women of the opposite sex.

927
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,040
I want to see your tits, my dear.

928
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I use my breath to get other people's attention.

929
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,560
Like all Americans, I like big things.

930
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:30,500


931
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Don't touch it!

932
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,300
If I could only stop, but I can't stop.

933
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,980
I've got this thing.

934
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm not talking to candle wax on the nipple.

935
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm not talking to candle wax on the nipple.

936
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,760
Like all Americans, I like big things.

937
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:43,880
Oh, I'm touching my tits.

938
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,600
Don't touch it!

939
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,940
Oh, I'm touching my tits.

940
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,500
I'm so proud of my preoperative transsexual lesbian side.

941
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,660
I'm so proud of my preoperative transsexual lesbian side.

942
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,840
I can only stop, but I can't stop.

943
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,540
I've got this thing.

944
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,280
And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular.

945
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,680
And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular.

946
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,740
You're looking at my tits now.

947
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,520
Nice set of hooters you got there.

948
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,660
Who are you really and what were you before?

949
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,740
I am Muffin. He's a girl.

950
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,780
A girl?

951
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,240
You are a lady from the ground up.

952
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,360
You can call her a woman. She is a whore, officer.

953
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,520
You can call her a woman. She is a whore, officer.

954
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:17,720
Yes, it's true.

955
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,740
I am Muffin.

956
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,960
She was a he?

957
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,200
No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis.

958
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,060
Well, uh, I had a little penis.

959
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,320
Well, uh, I had a little penis.

960
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,240
How can a guy be normal and go and do a thing like that to himself?

961
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,700
First of all, one sees a very, very bright light,

962
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,260
First of all, one sees a very, very bright light,

963
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,180
followed by a shockwave.

964
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,860
Five, four, three, two, one.

965
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:39,860


966
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,060
Two, one.

967
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,500
Two, one.

968
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
Sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.

969
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,480
Sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.

970
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:49,480


971
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,840
Stop, it's penis!

972
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,440
It's penis! It's penis!

973
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:53,560
It's penis!

974
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,660
Wow.

975
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,280
That would mean a total absence of genitalia.

976
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,100
It's kind of like turning the sock inside out.

977
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,020
I'm sorry.

978
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,720
Are you a boy or a girl?

979
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,780
Your choice is simple.

980
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,900
Are you a boy or a girl?

981
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,920
First time in my life I am not sure.

982
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,120
You're not putting mouth or rectum.

983
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
Would you do it for a scooby snack?

984
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,600
Your choice is simple.

985
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:24,500
Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship.

986
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,080
Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship.

987
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,780
I am not overreacting!

988
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,340
I am a teenager!

989
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,420
I am a teenager!

990
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,100
To serve men, it's a cookbook.

991
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:35,840
To serve men, it's a cookbook.

992
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,600
It's been stopped!

993
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,240
It's penis!

994
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,140
Something magic always happens with hot cocoa.

995
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,840
It's penis!

996
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,520
That was shallow, cheap, and based solely on hormones.

997
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,900
That was shallow, cheap, and based solely on hormones.

998
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,120
Very good. We have a winner here.

999
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,320
Very good. We have a winner here.

1000
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,400
This concludes this part

1001
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,020
of the Emergency Broadcast System.

1002
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,500


1003
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,560
of the Emergency Broadcast System.

1004
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,840
And there's nothing like Connie

1005
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,400
when you get right down to the

1006
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
meat of the matter.

1007
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,400
And oh, that's what it's all about

1008
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
with Connie the Trans Connie.

1009
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,260
with Connie the Trans Connie.

1010
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,280
Friends, they're by lovely Reverend

1011
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,760
Protectrix

1012
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,820
Amazonia.

1013
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,140
Just roll that name over your tongue.

1014
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,580
Protectrix

1015
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,080
Amazonia.

1016
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,800
Yes, and you're listening

1017
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,060
to the subgenius

1018
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,940
radio ministry Hour

1019
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,900
of Slack.

1020
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,580
Friends, if you need more information about

1021
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,160
Bob and Connie and the end

1022
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,220
of the world and our great events

1023
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,120
about those, then write to Bob

1024
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,820
at Post Office Box

1025
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,880
140306

1026
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,060
at Post Office Box

1027
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,060


1028
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,440
Dallas, Texas.

1029
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,840
That's Box 140306

1030
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,460
Dallas, Texas. And the zip

1031
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,880
is 75214.

1032
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,440
is 75214.

1033
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,860
Friends, you can also

1034
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
learn about Bob at

1035
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,660
sub site, the web

1036
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,380
www.subgenius.com

1037
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,380


1038
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,820
subgenius.com.

1039
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,200
Subgenius does not have an O in it, my dear

1040
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,760
friends and sisters.

1041
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,280
It is the home

1042
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,240
of the forbidden sciences.

1043
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,220
And that is what

1044
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,320
you will learn about, my

1045
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,740
friends.

1046
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,220
We don't understand all the

1047
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,240
super power that we have been given.

1048
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,140
Unlike any plant, animal,

1049
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,380
mineral, or anything else, we have

1050
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,500
the ability to transcend time in any

1051
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,180
of its dimensions. And instead

1052
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,240
of being afraid of time, we should use this

1053
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:38,620
power.

1054
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,960
There is a great deal of speculation about what

1055
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,240
is going to happen next.

1056
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,940
The tape is ready now.

1057
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,640
The lights have gone down just

1058
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,460
slightly.

1059
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,220
The Mr. Science Lecture

1060
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,740
Series.

1061
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,460
Volume 1, Number 1.

1062
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,840
The Neutron.

1063
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,360
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch,

1064
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,300
First Church of Mr. Science

1065
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:08,940
Boston.

1066
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,420
Outside the realm of conspiracy

1067
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,500
science, and in the clear light of

1068
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,940
the so-called forbidden sciences,

1069
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,160
we will find we have a far greater

1070
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,100
chance of understanding the true nature

1071
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,840
of the universe.

1072
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,300
What the conspiracy

1073
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,300
feeds us under the guise of the most

1074
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,300
vast system of natural philosophy

1075
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,060
is nothing but a complex

1076
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,480
sham. A decoy to hide

1077
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,440
from us the true fact of how much bigger

1078
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,540
and more complex and nut-wrenchingly

1079
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,380
frightening a place the universe is.

1080
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,380
We are told about matter and energy

1081
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,880
and space and time as being either

1082
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,280
consistent realities governed by laws

1083
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,160
or as foggy abstracts that have no

1084
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,100
particular being outside of that of

1085
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,760
being convenient linguistic aids to

1086
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,440
make the whole thing easier to swallow.

1087
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,340
We at the Temporal Management Research

1088
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,360
Facility of the Church of Mr. Science

1089
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,560
of the Subgenius have through rigorous

1090
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,480
probing through mountains of existing

1091
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,540
but full-known works on the subject of

1092
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,380
time and its methods, been able to

1093
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,380


1094
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,380


1095
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,860
discover the key for blowing the whistle

1096
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,840
on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is

1097
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,920
modern science. This key is the

1098
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,680
Mutron. The truth must now be told.

1099
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,880
How it was covered up for so long

1100
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,460
would make a story intriguing enough

1101
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,380
for a separate book, but it's too

1102
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,740
involved to be told here. The actual

1103
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,700
issue at hand is the Mutron and its

1104
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,460
pivotal role in the management of the

1105
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,220
true cosmos. In order to properly

1106
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,920
understand the following it must

1107
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,380
first be made clear what actually

1108
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,380


1109
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,380


1110
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,520
constitutes an elementary particle. The

1111
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,340
first of these basic particles is the

1112
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,900
electron which has no mass but possesses

1113
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
a charge that is commonly described as

1114
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,240
possibly infinite, thus making it the

1115
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,180
fundamental unit of energy. It and other

1116
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,600
related particles, i.e. positrons,

1117
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,480
photons, gravitons, etc. acting in

1118
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
concert make up the Yakutismic field

1119
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,300
which is responsible for holding

1120
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,920
everything that is anything together.

1121
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,220
The second is the much rarer infinite

1122
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,380
mass particle, the Positron. The

1123
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:08,380


1124
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:08,380


1125
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,660
Positron is commonly called a black

1126
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,020
hole. These particles, like the

1127
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,740
electrons, occupy no space but the

1128
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,540
influence of a single particle can be

1129
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,700
felt at a much greater distance. They

1130
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,800
often have event horizons many miles

1131
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,220
wide beyond which not even light can

1132
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:28,400
escape. The third fundamental particle is

1133
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,500
the Mutron. The Mutron carries with it an

1134
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,740
infinite temporal capacity that makes it

1135
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,640
alter the rate and intensity and general

1136
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,020
quality of the passage through time of

1137
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,380
any sort of energy. The Mutron is a

1138
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,440
very rare particle and is the only

1139
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,860
thing it touches. The Mutron is very

1140
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,600
likely the rarest particle in this

1141
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,180
universe. As far as we know there might

1142
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,060
well be only one of them, though there

1143
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,800
could be as many as a few dozen without

1144
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,040
generating a dangerous concentration of

1145
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,360
Mutron phenomena. The first segment of

1146
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,020
this report will deal with the general

1147
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,240
implications of the Mutron in regards to

1148
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
existing ideas on the workings of the

1149
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,760
universe. The second will concern the

1150
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,860
incredible potentialities of using the

1151
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,840
potent forces of the Mutron in time

1152
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,380
control research and in processing

1153
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,460
practical time control.

1154
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,420
Section A

1155
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
Just how fucking big everything

1156
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,360
really is.

1157
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,540
What we know as the universe can be

1158
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,440
envisioned as a giant atom with the

1159
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,540
black hole acting as the nucleus and the

1160
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,940
Mutron or Mutrons acting as the electron

1161
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,440
cloud with the electrons providing the

1162
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,200
energy for the Mutron to drive us

1163
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,480
forward through time. Just about

1164
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,320
everything else in the universe is just

1165
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,400
so much debris cluttering up the works

1166
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,900
of things.

1167
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,180
The fact that there is one such atom

1168
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,260
more than suggests the existence of

1169
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:42,560
others.

1170
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,220
The Mutron has a corresponding

1171
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,280
anti-particle known as the tachyon

1172
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,100
which travels through time in a

1173
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,020
direction which we perceive as backwards

1174
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,260
so that to someone who is not in the

1175
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,940
know it will appear to exceed the speed

1176
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,740
of light. The simple fact of the matter

1177
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,540
is that tachyons are extra universal

1178
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,960
Mutrons impinging on our universe at a

1179
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,140
different temporal angle.

1180
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,100
These are the Mutrons of atom universes

1181
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,380
that ours is in constant

1182
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,060
compound width.

1183
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,300
After this the atomic metaphor breaks

1184
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:12,800
down.

1185
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,460
No atom of

1186
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,480
mere matter divides itself into alternate

1187
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,400
cells almost constantly but our

1188
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,180
universe does.

1189
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,480
All the time the universe splits in order

1190
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,420
to express every alternative open to

1191
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,240
any phenomenon transpiring within

1192
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,220
no matter how small or seemingly

1193
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,460
insignificant. This is

1194
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,200
the only way our minds can express

1195
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,840
the perception of the fifth dimension

1196
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,120
or more properly the second dimension

1197
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,700
of time.

1198
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,080
So this introduces the concept of time

1199
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,800
viewed as a plane rather than a line.

1200
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,140
But there is another dimension of space

1201
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,780
so is the case with time there is also

1202
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,320
a corresponding up down time.

1203
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,660
This is the direction in which our

1204
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,740
mental eyes exist.

1205
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,340
In this direction we find alternate

1206
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,640
time tracks similar to the sidewise ones

1207
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,580
with the difference being that those

1208
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,400
are oriented in the direction opposed

1209
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,380
to temporal gravity.

1210
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,480
So that elements of those other

1211
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,000
cells are constantly falling into our

1212
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,060
awareness from above.

1213
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,400
The neutron passes through all these

1214
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,740
spaces with equal ease and is modulated

1215
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,580
by them much like the photon is

1216
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,580
modulated by bouncing off or passing

1217
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,140
through matter.

1218
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,260
Thus information of a very subtle

1219
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,420
and distorted nature is conveyed to us

1220
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,420
from our other universes on the

1221
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,140
neutron express.

1222
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,100
We call this information gnosis

1223
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,380
and its influence has been thought to

1224
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:38,380


1225
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,020
be developed by mankind time and again

1226
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,120
for as long back as we have records

1227
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,220
and no doubt back to our very genesis

1228
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,920
and before.

1229
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,180
The earliest known neutron impact on earth

1230
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,460
occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

1231
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,920
The primordial sea teemed with the most

1232
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,940
primitive of bacteria.

1233
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,400
Their genetic material was a simple

1234
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,320
molecule shaped like a lumpy ladder.

1235
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,420
It was very chemically stable.

1236
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,880
The neutron passed through earth and

1237
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,680
spewed out a wake that left each and

1238
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,920
every molecule of DNA twisted beyond

1239
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,380
recognition.

1240
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,760
In this state its stability was ruined

1241
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,180
and any force or random glitch that

1242
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,120
mother nature had to offer changed it

1243
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,460
somehow.

1244
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,040
Thus evolution had begun.

1245
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,240
Another notable neutron impact occurred

1246
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,500
about 60 million years ago at the end

1247
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,620
of the age of the dinosaurs.

1248
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,140
The particle struck and its wake left

1249
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,560
the intelligence of the dinosaurs

1250
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,880
increased a million fold.

1251
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,860
They promptly sat down, figured out

1252
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,740
how to teleport and promptly took off

1253
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,220
on around the universe vacation

1254
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,380
presuming that they were going to

1255
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,920
return.

1256
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,440
Another notable neutron impact only

1257
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,320
about 5 million years ago was

1258
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,940
responsible for the division of the

1259
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,040
human and yeti races.

1260
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,560
The vast majority of these events

1261
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,500
however affect individual beings or

1262
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:55,900
objects.

1263
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,320
One such example is Great Britain's

1264
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,480
Stonehenge Monument which was not

1265
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,200
man-made as is popularly presumed but

1266
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,880
is merely the material evidence of a

1267
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,440
rather minor neutron splash.

1268
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,380
Certain great mutants were found

1269
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:08,380


1270
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,520
in the site of the monument.

1271
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,000
The great sages of the past and present

1272
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,800
have actually had mutants pass directly

1273
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,640
through their crania.

1274
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,420
A partial listing of these select people

1275
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,680
will give an idea of the effects that

1276
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,440
may be expected of such an encounter.

1277
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,040
Gautama Buddha, the prophet Enoch,

1278
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,860
Ankh-Natan, Leonardo, William Beckford,

1279
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,400
Alastair Cowley, Marcel Duchamp,

1280
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,360
R. Buckminster Fuller, Antonio Gaudi,

1281
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,240
Arnold Palmer, the list goes on.

1282
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,400
It's interesting to note that J.R. Bob Dobbs

1283
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,000
is the only known human being through

1284
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,380
whom a meteorite can be seen.

1285
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,580
The second neutron is passed twice.

1286
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,920
After going through the back of his head

1287
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,880
it was reflected by the mystic pipe of

1288
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,640
Dobbs back through his head for a

1289
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,740
double dose of gnosis.

1290
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,620
In the light of this particular view

1291
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,560
one might ask, what about the big bang

1292
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,440
and all that stuff?

1293
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,120
Well, it seems that matter does not play

1294
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,080
a very big role in the actual nuts and

1295
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,620
bolts operation of the universe.

1296
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,860
In fact, we find that it is the case

1297
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,580
in about half the universe's sample

1298
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,040
that there is no matter at all.

1299
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,940
Section B. What we must do about all this.

1300
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,760
It is well known that the electron

1301
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,180
can be pressed into service for all kinds of uses.

1302
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,980
It might be less well known that alien civilizations

1303
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,600
of a level only slightly more advanced than ours

1304
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,040
routinely use the enormous power made available

1305
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,020
by tapping into the gravity fluxes

1306
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
of quantum black holes.

1307
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,400
It's also possible to use the time potentials

1308
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,240
of the neutron to our own great advantage.

1309
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,560
The neutron is not subject to the same methods

1310
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
of coercion that we use to bend normal

1311
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,260
subatomic particles to our will.

1312
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,380
They are oblivious to matter and energy

1313
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1314
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1315
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,100
alike. The power of pure thought

1316
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,760
because of its intimate relationship

1317
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,020
with time does have some small effect.

1318
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,360
Neutrons are attracted to areas

1319
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,200
of concentrated slackful enlightenment.

1320
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,680
A neutron container accelerator

1321
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,340
could be charged with a neutron

1322
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,660
if enough slackful minds concentrated

1323
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,640
their energies around a scoop entrance

1324
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,760
to the neutron accelerator.

1325
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,380
Once contained therein,

1326
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,660
it would take relatively little effort

1327
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,080
on the part of these minds

1328
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,860
to maintain it in a circular path.

1329
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,380
One pure thought can be used

1330
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,580
to determine the size of the accelerator.

1331
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,560
A purely technical problem facing this proposal

1332
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,540
is the size of the accelerator needed.

1333
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,780
It is a property of the neutron

1334
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,460
that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

1335
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,660
The minimum diameter of a circle

1336
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,880
to be traveled by a neutron

1337
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,760
is approximately 1,000 miles.

1338
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,140
Fortunately, we have easy access

1339
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,680
to an extraterrestrial body

1340
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,520
more than three times that size

1341
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,760
Earth's moon.

1342
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,640
The accelerator can be built in a ring

1343
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,900
completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere

1344
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,900
about 100 feet below its surface.

1345
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,480
Because of the mental effort that would run it,

1346
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,020
it would be known as the psychotron.

1347
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,120
The psychotron would be a valuable tool

1348
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,180
in the use of practical time control.

1349
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,200
By accelerating the neutron

1350
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,480
in one direction or another,

1351
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,260
the entire moon could be induced

1352
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,200
to follow it in whatever temporal direction

1353
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,180
it might be directed.

1354
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,100
Forward, backward, sideways, or up-down.

1355
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,260
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

1356
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,460
It is my proposal

1357
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,020
that this device be constructed

1358
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,660
for use in a major project

1359
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,160
to concentrate high slack

1360
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,780
and high-intensity time

1361
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:08,960
in the universe.

1362
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,060
The single most radiant personality

1363
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,200
among modern man is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1364
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,380
There are other alternate Bobs

1365
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,440
existing in other alternate time tracks.

1366
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,500
Not all of them are as prominent

1367
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,180
as our Bob,

1368
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,040
but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

1369
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,500
Others are already the rulers

1370
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,040
of their respective Earths.

1371
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,560
All, though, are truly Bob.

1372
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,940
Imagine if we could travel

1373
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,560
to those alternative time streams

1374
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,360
and convince all of those Bobs

1375
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:38,460
to be the best in the world.

1376
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,100
This is exactly what I am suggesting.

1377
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,820
The formation of the Congress of Bobs.

1378
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,420
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

1379
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,580
Those who wish to donate

1380
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,960
to the Psychotron Project

1381
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,680
will be given a free ride

1382
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,460
to the alternate world of their choice

1383
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,920
once the project is complete.

1384
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,400
Thank you.

1385
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,400
The Mutron by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

1386
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,640
from the 1980s.

1387
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,140
The most amazing piece

1388
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,900
of time control ever. Thank you.

What I want to know is, when I talk to somebody, is he real when I'm talking to him?

1392
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,920
Only when you're talking to him is he real.

1393
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,660
When he tries to answer, he becomes tape again.

1394
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,400
Oh, my God. Is this for real?

1395
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,700
No, no, no. This is just a tape. Relax.

1396
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,600
It is not the day before or the week between.

1397
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,600
It's just the show.

1398
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,300
The show that, yes, was thrown into the bay three weeks ago

1399
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,260
and struggled free of its chains and floated up, swam back to the studio here,

1400
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:27,940
climbed up the antenna, and is now running all the way down those little air wires right into your ears.

1401
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,760
Hi, you're still on the air. There will be a test on this show.

1402
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,520
Stay tuned. You never know when you're here or not on this show because there are so many doctors.

1403
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,740
Just a few dugs, sprinkle a few Gary's, drop a few bobs over here.

1404
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,540
Yes, I'm sorry, listener. You've got a real problem now.

1405
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,920
They're alive all the time.

1406
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,700
You're still there for no reason at all.

1407
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,580
What is that red button over there, dude?

1408
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,100
Go ahead, please.

1409
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,040
You know, brand or scheme.
