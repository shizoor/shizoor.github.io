1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm hampering efforts to reach a rocket-propelled iron fist.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,860
More than 100 blows with Israeli stones at Palestinian civilians with a 3.5% growth rate estimated a month ago.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,840
The White House is defending the White House.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,500
The White House.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,820
On Wall Street, 31-10-3-4-2068, the Commerce Department reports the growth brought expanded in the first quarter of the year.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,740
President Bush has signed an executive order giving the U.S. government new powers to clamp down on PR news in Washington.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:07,960
Now we're going to have Dr. Drummond here and then continue at some point with the subgenius auction of the treasures of time,

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,360
the last artifacts of old earth which we're going to be selling tonight,

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,800
including the extra lewd DVD of girls frisking unclothed in the locker room,

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,180
which he will probably bring from our...

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,880
Our cabin, where we studied it.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,880
You did?

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,740
Yes, to make sure that the buyers would get the value that they deserved.

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,760
There may be some other videos that need to be logged as part of the final procedure.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,500
We've only...

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,240
Well, hell, man, we've only got less than 12 hours left of earth money spending time.

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,740
But it is therapeutic for us to continue in our foolish humanoid rituals.

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,540
Buying and selling, getting and spending, and judging non-existent values against each other,

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
even unto the last moments of our existence.

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,220
For otherwise we would not be human.

22
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,680
And though we are subgeniuses, we are also human subgeniuses.

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
Oh, the humanity will go.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,260
It will be burned away in the searing fires of X-Day,

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,020
which is why the subgenius understructure,

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,460
the subgenius endoskeleton, is so important to cultivate.

27
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah, you want to know how girls look under their clothes?

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,400
Look to that endoskeleton.

29
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,060
One of nature's most remarkable creations.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,180
Hey, pater nostril, I'm going to turn the mics here up,

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,080
and you may want to turn your output down because it's for my tape, actually.

32
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,540
So there.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,000
If our voices echo in an unseemly way, then we are not human.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000


35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000


36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
But if our voices echo in an unseemly manner, you have to let us know because.

37
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,480
That's enough for, that's fine for me.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,380
This is getting to go on the escape ship.

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,220
Some of the last records made in this place.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,580
The final tapes made on Earth.

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,260
They'll study these tapes, you know, for clues and hints.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,500
What did we do wrong?

43
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,060
What could we have done to have joined them?

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,840
Why must we be left behind?

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,320
And it'll be too late.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,940
And now.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,700
They realize $30.00.

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:24,980


49
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:24,980


50
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:24,980


51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,740
$30.00 could have done it.

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,860
And it's too late.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,420
Those $35.00, ah, $30.00 mean nothing anymore.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,400
And they barely did back then.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,180
$30.00 used to be quite a chunk of change, but when you consider what the usual utility

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:49,120
bill is, $30.00 is a mere hiccup of a laugh in the night, a departing bunch of borgerigmus

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,960
or flatulence that you'd forget about.

58
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,760
And only the next day.

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,500
If then.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
You can wonder fleetingly what happened to it.

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,200
In the meantime, it would be guarding you, protecting you against the many horrors and

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,200
indignities of the seething subgenius apocalypse, which had you only considered was bearing

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,920
down upon you at that moment, as it does at this moment.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,380
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,640
Well, you can, we don't need to feather our comments because we're not trying to scare

66
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,340
everyone.

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,460
We all know the stakes in this terrible game we've been playing.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,040
The risk, the gamble, the sport of it all.

69
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,600
The sport, the lark, the joke, dear friends.

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,880
Well, that was Dr. Howell and myself awaiting the seething subgenius apocalypse that we

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,480
thought was bearing down upon planet Earth.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Quote, Earth, unquote.

73
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,320
Recorded on the stage at the Pavilion.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,320


75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,680
The Pavilion of Brushwood, the clothing optional campground in western New York where we await

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,980
the saucers.

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,940
Eight years in a row now.

78
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,440
But still, as you can tell, with total faith.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,960
Although, you know, the late afternoon just before X-Day, or X-Day-een we call it, that

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,960
can become a little challenging as we hear here in these live recordings.

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,160
The recordings made off the cult's soundboard by cultist Pater Nostril just before their

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,580
day of tragedy.

83
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,500
Ben Seven and Come and Gone in Australia and New Zealand.

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,840
Has anybody heard from Reverend Chain Smurker?

85
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,560
No?

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,080
That's a good sign!

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Has anybody heard from, what's his name, Reverend Cardboard Box in New Zealand?

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,740
No!

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,280
I haven't heard a word from him.

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,640
I haven't gotten any email from him in many hours.

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:50,940
I haven't heard a word from him.

92
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,060
Has anybody picked up any radio signals from New Zealand or Australia in the last

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,660
few hours?

94
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,820
You prove to me that they haven't been shut down, that they haven't been ruptured.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,840
You know, the people, ignorant, illiterate subgeniuses who don't ever buy the actual

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,800
book The Subgenius often ask that question to be cute.

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,140
Well, hey man, 7 a.m. is not Eastern Standard Time!

98
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,260
Arrgh!

99
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,280
Central Time!

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,460
But, as we all know from long, long studying of the pre-scriptures, that the saucers line

101
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:37,760
up vertically over, from North Pole to South Pole over the International Date Line, which

102
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,540
starts in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

103
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,920
And at 7 a.m. they turn on their rupture sucking device and let the world rotate underneath

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,500
them.

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,080
They don't.

106
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,760
They're slack.

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:59,100
see path of least resistance thus um you know it's 7 15 right now here well it was 7 a.m 12 hours ago

108
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:09,320
somewhere and we haven't heard from them but i would think that by by the time say beijing was

109
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,060
utterly destroyed by the exodus we'd start getting even here at brushwood we'd start getting news

110
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,320
wouldn't there be people running down the hill going man did you hear it's like weirder than the

111
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:26,560
tsunami it's like everyone east of the time zone has disappeared the every and some of them are

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,940
skeletons and some of them are just piles of clothes the piles of clothes are the subgeniuses

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,300
friends it'll be mostly skeletons as we saw in that war of the worlds low budget movie

114
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,360
skeletons that continue to writhe in agony and pain as

115
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,040
the

116
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,040


117
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,160
they burn they as their after long after the flesh and tendons have burned off the skeletons

118
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,020
still struggle in agony this is a terrible thing to say but it's true it's young men such as you

119
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:06,240
18 to 25 years old who are doing most of the killing you american boys

120
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,720
you're killing your own people and yourselves you are killing american women

121
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,820
american men american children

122
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,360

class

135
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,120
Break it up, you squares.

136
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,800
We've got all our lives ahead of us.

137
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
We'll manage somehow.

138
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
And a long life.

139
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,560
What a night.

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,100
The longer, the better.

141
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,640
I can't do...

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,900
I plan on doing a little snuggling with Claire.

143
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,060
Coming, baby.

144
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,020
When she comes.

145
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,300
When she comes.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,560
Comes.

147
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,440
Golly, Mike.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,300
Six inches.

149
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,560
Four and a half inches.

150
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

151
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,980
We'll kill, we'll kill, kill, we'll kill, we'll kill, we'll kill.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,840
We've given him plasma.

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,060
Thank you.

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,100
I think he can take it.

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,080
Hey, fella.

156
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,560
How are you feeling?

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Do you remember what happened last night?

158
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
Airman Wilkins had five.

159
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,740
And Airman Kelly had six.

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,700
You turned over twice.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,720
Badly.

163
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,260
Beaten up.

164
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,500
What about her leg?

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,200
What about her leg?

166
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,320
Let it go.

167
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
Get it over with.

168
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,280
Millions of men have dedicated their lives to killing your own people.

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,580
And yourselves.

170
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,060
But there's always some kid who comes along to dirty that reputation.

171
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
There's a great little guy.

172
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,580
Yeah.

173
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,420
So keep your mouth shut.

174
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,700
I don't know what to say.

175
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,700
I never had this happen before.

176
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,320
I don't know what to say.

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
He didn't look bad at all.

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,660
I know how you feel.

179
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,180
I don't know what to say.

180
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,460
I know how you feel.

181
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,680
Joy writing, dear friends, by Norell Preff.

182
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,800
Who is now at Norellpreff.com.

183
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,080
Go there for his slackful stuff.

184
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
And that's what it's all about, isn't it?

185
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Yeah.

186
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,120
Slack.

187
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,540
Not intelligence, but slack.

188
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,220
Friends, you don't need those brain cells.

189
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,080
You don't need to be able to read.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,200
All you need is to be able to recognize the Dobbs head.

191
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,300
That's really all it takes.

192
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,060
I've found that sometimes I wish I could be blind to everything that wasn't a Dobbs head.

193
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,720
Well, be careful what you wish for, Ivan.

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,780
Like the picture of Dorian Gray, a hideous bargain could still be enacted.

195
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,680
And while we're all enjoying the pleasure so much,

196
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,460
the sex goddesses,

197
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,840
you could be in a jag, an endless loop, staring at that head.

198
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,460
And you've done enough of that in your ministry.

199
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,500
Don't you tell me when I've done too much Dobbs head.

200
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,780
We know you've suffered too much.

201
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,920
To bring slack to others, you've often lost it yourselves.

202
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:32,160
And I know that you're tempted to go out in a blazing, burning engram of the Dobbs face

203
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
on your head.

204
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,740
But this sacrifice may not be necessary.

205
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,940
Who needs arms? Who needs legs?

206
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,580
The Dobbs head doesn't have those.

207
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,160
If I could just have each part amputated, bit by bit,

208
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,860
until there was nothing left but the head.

209
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,980
And have the little dots tattooed on.

210
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,280
You know, and be just like Bob.

211
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,420
But isn't that the nightmare of religion, you know?

212
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,300
It's very expensive.

213
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,640
The soma-ectomy takes many stages.

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,220
That's the ultimate example of sucking the finger rather than going where it points.

215
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,140
Bob doesn't want a planet of all male salesmen selling silly crap to each other.

216
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,660
Then there's the facial reconstruction surgery.

217
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,220
He wants a million different kind of people selling crap where the profits come back to him.

218
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,820
That's all.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,440
And the dotoplasty is another thing that is quite expensive when they do it.

220
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,260
The whichplasm?

221
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,440
The dotoplasty.

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,220
When they put the dots on, each one has to be gathered from another part of the body, reshaped.

223
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,460
But they can do anything these days.

224
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,060
Particularly down in South America, you know the way it is.

225
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,860
They don't have those silly laws with the fetus brain tissue and so forth.

226
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Friends, if you end up with any possible access to any extra fetus brain tissue, we have use for that.

227
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,280
And the fetus can actually be pretty well along.

228
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,360
Delicious.

229
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,000
An ice cream in milkshakes and to top your favorite dessert.

230
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,000
The universe.

231
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,480
I am Rocket Boy.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Strawberry Shark Cake, help me.

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
I want my mommy.

234
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,820
Strawberry Shark Cake, help me.

235
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,460
I want my mommy.

236
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,780
Strawberry Shark Cake.

237
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,800
Well, it's rather interesting that I was asked to follow Dr. Hal.

238
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,440
At the risk of getting killed.

239
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,680
At the risk of sounding too overly kiss-ass.

240
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,920
I've been a fan and admirer of the doctor since I first saw his artwork in Paradox Press' book,

241
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,060
The Big Book of Conspiracies, when I was roughly around 11 or 12 years of age.

242
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,900
It was that book that led me into the Church of the Subgenius because that book had a forward by Reverend Ivan Stang.

243
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,820
But Dr. Hal is, I suppose, a archetype of some kind.

244
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,440
A union sort of archetype.

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,520
And in fact, that's a little bit of what I'd like to talk about.

246
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,960
You see, I've noticed this week that Slack has come to me in very interesting sort of ways.

247
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:24,900
My approach to Slack this week has been realizing at the oddest sort of moments how I felt when I had more Slack when I was a young child.

248
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,320
That ineffable feeling at this Brushwood place is similar to that lilting feeling of joy.

249
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,500
That a young child has when they're at their grandparents' house.

250
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,200
And you know, I'm 18 years old.

251
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,900
I'm a heterosexual male virgin.

252
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:46,660
And yet, in my time, in my life, the things I've experienced have kind of popped my cherries, so to speak.

253
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,180
I sort of have a...

254
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,160
Well, I'm overcoming a certain cynical realism.

255
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,580
Because these are hard times.

256
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,620
These are difficult times, not only to be a subgenius, but to be an American, to be a human on this planet.

257
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,960
It's a sick world, I think we all realize.

258
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,520
It's a sick world when, you know, a conspiracy over man can molest children and get away with it.

259
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,060
It's a sick world when we have Bush and so on and so forth.

260
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,620
It's a sick world when we don't have any Slack.

261
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,220
And, you know, Slack to some is certainly rewarding and relaxation and ease and patience.

262
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,540
But one of the more interesting aspects of the Church of the Subgenius is that we make no attempt, we make no pretense to make you feel comfortable.

263
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,800
We simply bring you up here, show you our dog and pony show, and if you like it, you like it, and if you don't, hopefully you leave and we never see you again.

264
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:46,180
Indeed, it would be an interesting sort of predicament should the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms come across this place.

265
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,540
I think we would all know what would happen then.

266
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,880
They'd murder us and blame us for our own deaths.

267
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,820
I'm sure our Nazi friend can tell us a little bit more about that.

268
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,980
But moving right along.

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,300
The conspiracy would do this because the conspiracy exists and plays the role of the conspiracy.

270
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,300


271
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,320
It's the role of philanthropists.

272
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,800
To quote the character of Clinton Stark in George Powell's film, The Seven Faces of Dr. Lau,

273
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,440
I'm a philanthropist, boy. I like to help people.

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,420
Well, that's what the conspiracy does best, is it helps people.

275
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:23,020
And, in fact, we're living in an epoch in which the conspiracy is helping us through the standard conservative methods of guns and bombs and death and destruction.

276
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,280
Now, in the Clinton years, we had the standard liberal conspiracy helping of, you know,

277
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,720
vaguely socialist sort of programs and a glossy idealism.

278
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,220
Well, here's an example.

279
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,060
For instance, you're a subgenius.

280
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,460
You've had some problems, some personal problems, some life problems that Bob isn't just enough for.

281
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
So you go to the doctor.

282
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
The doctor looks over at your records and he says,

283
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,520
Ah, okay, I see what we have for you.

284
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,420
You are a bipolar, schizotypical, high-functioning autistic.

285
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,220
Please take these pills and function as a normal person.

286
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,200
Because this unmutualism will not stand.

287
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,040
And then, of course, George W. Bush wouldn't know anything about that.

288
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,200
He'll just bomb the fuck out of you.

289
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,860
Slack. Slack is an interesting subject.

290
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,640
I've written these down.

291
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,740
Slack. Slack. Slack of the Bobbies says,

292
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,020
Oh, I've got to show off how weird I am and how strange and bizarre and freaky I am.

293
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,740
Most subgeni I've noticed aren't necessarily concerned with being weirdos as much as they are with slacking off.

294
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,360
In fact, I myself indulge in the conspiracy media.

295
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,560
I enjoy pop music and, you know, TV movies and what have you.

296
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,300
But it doesn't make me any less of a subgenius, I hope.

297
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,840
Indeed, the conspiracy produces good things.

298
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,440
I've often listened to albums by Christina Aguilera and thought,

299
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,560
You know, those producers have deft little fingers.

300
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,540
Perhaps if they weren't conspiracy monsters, they might make something of themselves.

301
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,740
And, of course, I've known the slack of sales.

302
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,500
Reverend Lord Ferg and I used to install car audio.

303
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,720
And when you made that perfect sale, you felt a jolt of slack carouse up and down your Kundalini.

304
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,120
After that, I worked telemarketing.

305
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,120
And the jolt was not quite as strong, but it was still there.

306
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,160
The fact of the matter is that slack exists in many, many forms.

307
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
And it is for us to understand them.

308
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,920
Indeed, that is the function of life on this planet.

309
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,040
As a subgenius, you realize that there are three functions.

310
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,720
First of all is to appreciate, respect, love, and worship God.

311
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,560
Secondly, is to appreciate, love, and worship, respect, and act as a conduit for slack.

312
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:41,880
And thirdly, is to press on and hope that your evolutionary dictation progresses into the future.

313
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,500
Because we are the 0.1% that acts against the bulwark of conspiracy bullshit.

314
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,620
We are riding the crest of a fabulous fractal wave directly into what could be a wonderful future

315
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,720
if we act now and strike while the other is still there.

316
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,220
And the iron is hot.

317
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,160
My prophecy, as Reverend Stang has mentioned a number of times,

318
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,080
is that NASA has sent up missiles to destroy the Yakutism of scout ships.

319
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,740
But I still feel that NASA covered up what could have been the most threatening aspect of life on this planet.

320
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,640
The shift of the poles with their tsunami story.

321
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,440
But, you know, that is what it is.

322
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,800
It's interesting to point out that

323
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,720
youth may come and age may go,

324
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,340
but there will be no more circuses like this show.

325
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,520
And that they came to snuff the rooster,

326
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,080
but you know, he ain't ever gonna die.

327
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,660
As I said before,

328
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,440
if you're the sort of person who regards yourself as an extropian,

329
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,300
as someone pushing on towards an evolutionary progression,

330
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
towards perhaps a great singularity,

331
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
possibly from an Exos destroyer,

332
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
or from the ending of a Mayan universal calendar,

333
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,040
you still see that idealistic spark in every apocalyptic nightmare you've ever had.

334
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,940
And what I would like to recommend to you today

335
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,080
is that you maintain that idealistic spark,

336
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,960
you keep it strong, powerful, healthy, and lit,

337
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,220
and you go out of this place as happy as you came,

338
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,160
making the world a better, safer place for SLAC and sub-GNI in general.

339
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Thank you.

340
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,580
Woo!

341
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,980
Woo!

342
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,060
Woo!

343
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,880
Woo!

344
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,960
Woo!

345
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,760
Reverend Alex Thompson, friends!

346
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,920
Best Diction!

347
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,300
One kid, violence.

348
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,660
Two kids, violence.

349
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,960
Three kids, violence.

350
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

351
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,020
We rock!

352
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,260
Yeah!

353
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,140
Welcome to the program.

354
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,840
Hey, I'm going to take you, take you down, take you down, take you down

355
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,040
in an entirely different line.

356
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,340
You need to talk to your attorney.

357
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,200
Give me a break.

358
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,120
You don't need this.

359
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,060
Give me a break here.

360
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,540
Silly, foolish woman.

362
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:50,880
Me.

363
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,900
Get rid of her.

364
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,780
Do you really finally understand?

365
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,580
You can give me a lecture.

366
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,380
You can beg me.

367
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,180
You can bribe me.

368
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,780
I don't get it.

369
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,980
There's nothing I can do.

370
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,980
Going in a circle.

371
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,960
Going in a circle.

372
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,780
Boyfriend came and shot up your kids.

373
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,240
Madam.

374
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Tire tubes and don't make more babies.

375
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,460
Bull.

376
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:04,780
Dog.

377
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,120
Bull.

378
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,460
Dog.

379
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:05,820
Bull.

380
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,160
Bull.

381
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,460
Bull.

382
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,820
Dog.

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,060
Bull.

384
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,320
Dog.

385
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,520
Bull.

386
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,040
Dog.

387
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,560
If I choose to live with a violent man, there's not a thing you can do about it.

388
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,080
Yikes.

389
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,740
Depressed.

390
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,900
Low self-esteem.

391
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,060
Feeling like a failure.

392
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,040
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

393
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,220
Oppressed other people.

394
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

395
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,300
We rock!

396
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,540
Dr. Schlesinger.

397
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,120
Welcome to the program.

398
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,100
I cannot fit.

399
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,580
Me.

400
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,360
Not eating.

401
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,340
Starting to drink.

402
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:27,980
Me.

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,060
L-a-r-d-u-r-l-a-r-d-d-r.

404
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,580
Do it.

405
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,020
A boyfriend.

406
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,260
You gotta do what you have to do.

407
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Because you knew.

408
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,480
Me.

409
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,900
Me.

410
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,260
I am my kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids.

411
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,800
Crappy mom, mom, mom, mom.

412
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,740
What's wrong?

413
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,100
On the highway.

414
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,260
On the highway.

415
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,520
Yeah.

416
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah.

417
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,260
Isn't that ironic?

418
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,940
Do they know?

419
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,280
Yeah.

420
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,280


421
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,280


422
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,280


423
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,280


424
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,080
Oh, boy, don't even bother to go there.

425
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,480
You know,

426
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Laura Schlesinger specializes in trauma,

427
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,440
and there's no quick fix to this.

428
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,500
Norrell Preff, and before that,

429
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,900
Reverend Alex Thompson,

430
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,800
coming up, radio synesthesia clips.

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,080
But now, friends, there's still time to...

432
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,060
Get in the water.

433
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,040
There's still time to get in the water.

434
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,180
Friends, think about it.

435
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,560
This could be your last night on Earth.

436
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,480
Have you called your old ma up and told her you loved her?

437
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,100
Well, if you haven't, too late.

438
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,140
You can't do it from here.

439
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,620
I mean, think about that.

440
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,860
When was the last time you called up your old ma

441
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,800
and told her you loved her?

442
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,220
This could be the last chance.

443
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,260
Think about that.

444
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,220
What if they don't love her, though?

445
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,080
What if they hate their ma

446
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,220
and they call her up and say,

447
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,220
Ma, I love you.

448
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,420
That could send the wrong message.

449
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,520
Well, it works both ways.

450
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,540
This is your last chance to tell her off

451
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,660
and get it off your chest.

452
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,640
Yes, it is.

453
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,660
But then there's also a sort of blessing

454
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,400
in her not knowing.

455
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,880
I mean, let's look at this realistically.

456
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
The nice thing about the apocalypse

457
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,600
is that you all go together when you go.

458
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,540
It's not as if just you died

459
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,760
and let your loved ones

460
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,000
to discover your pornography collection

461
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
on their own.

462
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,420
No, they all go up

463
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,480
in complete ignorance

464
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,980
of every terrible thing.

465
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,360
And you are buoyed up

466
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,540
by the idea that

467
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,340
you know there is something more.

468
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,500
What's the name of that company

469
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,740
that if you die accidentally

470
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,220
they come in and scrub all the porno off you?

471
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,120
Your computer before your family gets there?

472
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,820
That's Clean Co.

473
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,180
Okay, all right, yeah.

474
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,100
But you know, all they do is record it for themselves.

475
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,420
Good business if you think about it.

476
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,440
You know, really, the only way

477
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,980
to get the child pornography off of your hard drive

478
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,040
is to strap the hard drive

479
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,260
to the exterior of one of the space shuttles

480
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,920
on the heat shielding.

481
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,940
That's how the congressmen

482
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,540
get rid of their child pornography.

483
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,380
Well, they claim they get rid of it.

484
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,060
Actually, they need it for further study.

485
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,060
Did you bring that?

486
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,720
Did you get a DVD of the locker room,

487
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,260
shower room antics here,

488
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,200
as I asked you?

489
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,060
Because we are going to have to sell it.

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,960
No, I didn't bring it with me.

491
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,380
I still had it in the locker room.

492
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,580
Well, during the auction

493
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,440
we'll sell it and then they can come by

494
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
the subgenius cabin

495
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,600
to get it.

496
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,640
Yeah, it's

497
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,760
really something.

498
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,900
It's really something inept.

499
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,380
Bad camera work.

500
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,100
It's only 53 minutes

501
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,860
and it's got like six chapters.

502
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,440
The worst is you have to listen to them,

503
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,000
to their chatter while they get naked.

504
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They're giggling and tittering

505
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,700
and having a great old time.

506
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,720
Yeah, but they're boring.

507
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
Scrubbing the bees and soap

508
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,940
off each other's bare buttocks.

509
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,300
Yeah, well, for all of us,

510
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,760
it could be better

511
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,260
considering the contents.

512
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,740
Friends, you'll be soaping the buttocks

513
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,560
of alien space goddesses

514
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,860
in just a matter of hours.

515
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,600
If buttocks they truly be.

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,700
They yours.

517
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,440
I'll be soaping your buttocks.

518
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,240
That's what I'm trying to warn them about.

519
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,960
In fact, that will happen.

520
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
The holy injunction,

521
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,860
wash your ass, will be enacted

522
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,720
unto the nth degree

523
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,100
aboard the space saucers.

524
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,420
Because nothing

525
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,460
impure and organic

526
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,420
can be allowed to go.

527
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,340
What is dirt, anyway?

528
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,580
Dirt only is something

529
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,720
which has had some touch of life

530
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,400
in it.

531
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,480
Pure, sterile,

532
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,440
sand and lunar regolith

533
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,760
is not dirty because

534
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,540
there's never been any feces in it

535
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,400
or dead bugs or anything

536
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,780
like that. But

537
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,120
the divine presence of life

538
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
is what creates filth.

539
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,020
And on the space

540
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,240
vessels, of course, as we

541
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,620
enter into a new

542
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,760
understanding with the cosmos,

543
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,060
these ludicrous

544
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,100
flesh bags will

545
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,380
probably be discarded. Or at least

546
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,140
made highly more

547
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,540
efficient and tolerable.

548
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,460
It'll be just like getting new shoes.

549
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,500
That's all. It'll be like

550
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,140
a momentary discomfort and then breaking them in.

551
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,260
But yeah, sure.

552
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,660
A new shoe.

553
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,180
They may be tight and cause blisters for the first

554
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,560
few thousand years.

555
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,660
You're talking about your flesh bag.

556
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,880
Your new body.

557
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,080
I'm talking about soul blisters.

558
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,140
You know, we were asking one

559
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,720
X-Day drill,

560
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,140
how are you going to remake your body?

561
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,020
And Rockner, I think, said,

562
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm going to just stay the way I am.

563
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,780
Because I've gotten used to it.

564
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Well, you can't, you know,

565
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,720
change perfection.

566
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,900
That's one thing to be said about

567
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,920
change. One does not

568
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,020
need to make these changes, just

569
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,920
for the sake of some sort of busy work.

570
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,980
But, you know,

571
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,960
once you can redesign your body,

572
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,760
why not? It's a gas.

573
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,920
It's a laugh and a half. What do you think

574
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,960
about that old, that thing where the guy said,

575
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,500
if it ain't broke,

576
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,340
break it.

577
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Well, that's like some

578
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,320
remnant of old hippie

579
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,420
philosophy. I remember a similar

580
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,840
mantra about, you know,

581
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,580
if you can't pick it up or eat it,

582
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,840
then shit on it.

583
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,320
No, that was the dog's credo.

584
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,480
If you can't eat it,

585
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,140
fuck it, piss on it.

586
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,560
Well, dogs or humans,

587
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,500
it was a

588
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,180
disappointingly utilitarian philosophy.

589
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,800
Which we hope

590
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,320
to transcend by our efforts.

591
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,920
Because there are other ways.

592
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,440
That it can be

593
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,840
happily used.

594
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Perhaps this is what Rachnar was

595
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,460
indicating in his

596
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:24,860
rant.

597
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,300
Well, you know, I mean, we have

598
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,180
so many choices.

599
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,220
I mean, look at the way people modify

600
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,300
their bodies now. Think if you had

601
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,340
every possible, I mean,

602
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,200
when your imagination is the only

603
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,660
limitation for it.

604
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,380
Well, I'm afraid we'll see an awful lot of

605
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,660
werewolves and vampires.

606
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,880
Well, that's, of course, what a student.

607
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,960
You know, goth kids that really look a little

608
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,140
extra vampire-ish and tough guys.

609
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Yes, flouncing,

610
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,940
prancing, my little ponies,

611
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,260
unicorns,

612
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,680
flibberty gibbet, big-eyed anime

613
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,820
princesses. I have to put up

614
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,760
with a lot. But as we leave

615
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,700
Earth and its many solacisms

616
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,080
behind, the original meaning

617
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,980
that adhered to these things will become

618
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,200
faint, and we can accept them

619
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
just as another god-awful

620
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,040
vision, like all the ones that will

621
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,240
be forced to

622
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,220
confront from nanosecond to nanosecond.

623
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,920
And I don't mind, personally,

624
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,200
if the Trojan horse of evolution

625
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
is pleasure.

626
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,740
Bring on the shemale

627
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,760
and something incredibly new

628
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,340
will happen. Many of our predecessors

629
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,600
had to change

630
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,740
and become something different.

631
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,780
Now, actually, the

632
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,220
Church of Bob and the teachings of Bob are not

633
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,360
exactly...

634
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
Well, I mean, it is a religion, but it's

635
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,640
more like sci-fi.

636
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,960
You could call it religion-fi.

637
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,020
In fact, if they had a...

638
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,480
If there was a re-fi

639
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,180
section at the bookstore, that's where

640
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,340
our stuff would be in.

641
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,260
Religious fiction, you might say.

642
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,200
I was...

643
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
And how is that different from all the rest?

644
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,020
I was, unlike most kids,

645
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,260
I was not raised in a

646
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,360
religious home, and I don't have a bone to pick

647
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
with any particular religion. I was raised

648
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,780
on sci-fi,

649
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
instead of the Bible. Same difference.

650
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,140
Something like that.

651
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,060
And I... But after...

652
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,220
You know, after a while, I kind of felt like

653
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,480
I was grown out of that, and I read a lot

654
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,860
of comparative religion

655
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,540
when I was younger, and then I got into the paranormal

656
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,520
and really read up a lot

657
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,900
on the paranormal, but eventually

658
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,060
I switched to history

659
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,480
because it was weirder.

660
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,480
If you don't believe me, pick up

661
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,280
a history of Russia, and

662
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
it's weirder than the...

663
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,880
the weirdest paranormal crap

664
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,940
I ever read. But now, I'm

665
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,820
kind of back to science fiction again,

666
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,320
like my childhood religion,

667
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,940
and because out of all those forms,

668
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,620
you know, paranormal books,

669
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
religious books, and history books,

670
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,220
the sci-fi writers work the hardest

671
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,820
to make their bullshit plausible.

672
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,040
No offense,

673
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,860
but they really try to,

674
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,920
you know, the hard sci-fi books,

675
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,040
the ones with the spaceships on the

676
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,180
covers. There's the other kind

677
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,040
that has dragons on the covers, and

678
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,940
those are probably really good too, but those

679
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,080
aren't the kind that I like.

680
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,160
I do, friends, understand

681
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,900
the pull of the demon

682
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,700
haunted world.

683
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,240
The Church of the Subgenius

684
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,020
is looking for misfits,

685
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,860
disbelievers, or those who will

686
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,040
believe anything. I believe just about

687
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
everything at some point or another.

688
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,920
Why do you think I'm working for J.R. Bob

689
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,460
Dobbs?

690
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,720
You know, friends,

691
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
you have to believe

692
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,420
that

693
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,600
you can get something for nothing.

694
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
That's what Bob's promising, for

695
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,340
$30.

696
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,880
You can get something

697
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,700
for nothing. You have to believe

698
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,100
in that magical thing

699
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,360
because, you know,

700
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,060
even if something for nothing doesn't come

701
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,980
your way, if you had faith

702
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,080
that it would, if you believed

703
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,220
that it would, then even if it didn't, you'll think

704
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,720
it did. So what's the difference?

705
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,260
And that right there is the,

706
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,520
that's the true miracle

707
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,020
of religion. And people,

708
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,480
people say there's no such thing as magic.

709
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,660
You know, and

710
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,700
yet, and yet they still

711
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,380
have faith in such

712
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,620
utter bullshit. To me, that's proof,

713
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,840
proof that miracles still exist.

714
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,580
Some people believe in

715
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,660
magic

716
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,020
and

717
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,800
it works for them. That's the

718
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,960
important thing. It works.

719
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,560
Some people don't believe in magic

720
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,820
and it works even better for them.

721
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,180
Laughter

722
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,660
Laughter

723
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,400
Now, and you might say, oh, well,

724
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
you know, he thinks he's real smart.

725
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,960
Well, we did call it Church of the Subgenius,

726
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,020
friends. If you think about it,

727
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,400
almost everybody can qualify.

728
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,000
Every now and then we run into people

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
who kind of, well,

730
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,240
I'm, I think I'm not exactly

731
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,420
subgenius.

732
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,760
Laughter

733
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,680
Do you qualify?

734
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,200
That was recorded at

735
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,260
Winterstar of 2005.

736
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,580
I've got a,

737
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,780
come up with something new for Starwood,

738
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,460
which is July 19th through the 24th,

739
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,500
also at Brushwood,

740
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,060
but sponsored by Ace

741
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,300
of Cleveland.

742
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,320
What?

743
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,800
Huh?

744
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,300
Huh?

745
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,320
Huh?

746
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,260
Uh, anyway, friends,

747
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,340
and now back to the, uh, that's the amino

748
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,420
acids in the background. There's no

749
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,380
explaining them. Uh, but, uh, now back

750
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,280
to the, uh, 8X Day

751
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,960
Drill, actually the 10th

752
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,260
Drill, as, uh, Dr. Howell

753
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,340
and Dr. Drummond and I attempt to

754
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,260
kill time until

755
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,820
the world ends

756
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,540
along with time.

757
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,420
So, uh,

758
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
um, we, uh,

759
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,300
I don't know when we're gonna do

760
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,220
the auction, but I guess that will close

761
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
off these proceedings, and then, uh,

762
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,240
each person must, uh, retire

763
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,100
and consider the, uh,

764
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,420
the last minute preparations

765
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,400
that must be made for the apocalypse.

766
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,520
Some people want to get a good

767
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,200
night's sleep, because it's a long way,

768
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,020
you know? Yeah,

769
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,440
some try the staying up all night

770
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,280
drinking approach, which almost

771
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,400
always results in passing out at

772
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,520
quarter of seven. Or you can

773
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,300
go to X Day and

774
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,580
You might want to work out, you know, go down

775
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,320
to the gym and work out. Some people

776
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,480
feel that the act of

777
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,860
getting up and coming down here

778
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,380
at 7 o'clock is

779
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,500
itself a sign to the excess that we

780
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,600
don't have slack, and that in order to

781
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,240
show that we're worthy of them,

782
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,440
we should stay in bed this time.

783
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,160
But it just seems like a,

784
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,400
it's, that would kind of wreck the tradition.

785
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
I mean, uh,

786
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,920
they can get you, even if you're in bed.

787
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,800
You really want to go to Planet X that bad?

788
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,340
Well, yeah, I guess so.

789
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,080
Come, Jones,

790
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,360
coming! You've just got

791
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,380
to get up and out of bed for

792
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,280
some things, like when you're a little shaver.

793
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,420
To get up and go downstairs and watch

794
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,000
cartoons, it's necessary to

795
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,960
leave your bed. As I was,

796
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,440
as I've been telling people,

797
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,180
every X Day, when I get up at 6

798
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,640
30 in the morning,

799
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,380
and have to get my clothes on

800
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,500
so early and go

801
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,280
work down here. It's horrible having to

802
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
stumble out of bed and

803
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,900
shave and everything, but...

804
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,320
I think to myself, well, at least as

805
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,100
a sacred scribe of the subgenius church,

806
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,240
I only have to do this once a year

807
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
instead of five times a week.

808
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,360
Yes, the pinks have to do it

809
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,440
all their lives.

810
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,920
My own wife,

811
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,180
a princess of an outer space

812
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,380
fleet, has to get up and go

813
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,460
to work every day.

814
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,460
Fair is a river in Africa

815
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,660
or the place where you take

816
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,380
your pig and hope to win a prize.

817
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,760
But justice and karma

818
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,300
are a lie

819
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,560
and God does not

820
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,500
care. And the Tsar is

821
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,460
very far away.

822
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,440
So, it's up to you,

823
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
my friends, to build your

824
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,340
own ship. And your own

825
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,480
faith and slack shall draw those

826
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,460
X's. So therefore, if they don't show up tomorrow,

827
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,440
it's your fault, not mine. Don't throw shit

828
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,260
at me. I'm getting tired.

829
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,660
I'm getting tired of that. That's old.

830
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,260
But didn't you practice running this year?

831
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,240
You know, actually, I never make

832
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,960
any plans for 7 a.m.

833
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,100
except to

834
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,360
greet the sex goddesses

835
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,160
in power and glory.

836
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,240
And I have a list in my

837
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,820
head of hurry to

838
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Amsterdam and get the Rijksmuseum

839
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,120
before some fuckhead subgenius

840
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,380
destroys it. Get the Grand Canyon.

841
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,140
Get Monument Valley, some of my

842
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,000
favorite places. The plastic dinosaur.

843
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,800
The warehouse in Las Vegas.

844
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,260
No, that's yours. Yeah, that's what I'm pointing out.

845
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,580
That one is mine. And I don't want anybody

846
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,360
fucking with me. I don't want to show up

847
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,320
at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam

848
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,100
and find one of you motherfuckers

849
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,280
beaming up all the cool furniture out of there.

850
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,760
You're welcome to it. Because you will

851
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,960
have to back your fucking

852
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,060
saucer cart off of my

853
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,480
green, daddy-o.

854
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,180
The real problem, it could be

855
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,520
that at 7.15

856
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,260
tomorrow, we'll all be at bitter

857
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,300
war with each other using weapons.

858
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
That's something that's previously unimaginable.

859
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,120
Yeah, but once we get on the spaceship,

860
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,320
the chair, even the shittiest

861
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,160
kitchen chairs there are

862
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,180
more comfortable than anything that's

863
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,860
ever been imagined on Earth.

864
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,780
That's true, but you might want to preserve

865
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,860
some of your previous identity.

866
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,900
Don't forget your roots

867
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,880
as an ape.

868
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,100
The scene is a

869
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,240
spaceship, Benson.

870
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,060
You are beautiful woman scientist.

871
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,200
Your spaceship is nearing

872
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,020
its destination.

873
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,200
003-200.

874
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,100
When you finish that...

875
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,540
Now,

876
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,960
just let me look.

877
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,960
I hope so.

878
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,960
Me too.

879
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,100
Step out.

880
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,120
What are you doing out there?

881
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,140
Why don't you shut up?

882
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,760
You said, he said.

883
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,020
This can go on forever.

884
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,860
You said, he said.

885
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,140
This can go on forever.

886
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,540
Well, I guess I can if she can.

887
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,780
Okay, thanks a lot.

888
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,460
Oh, some sex

889
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,420
goddesses.

890
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,060
Thanks to

891
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,320
norlpref.com

892
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,380
And then there's the horrible theory

893
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
that the subgenie,

894
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,160
that everything went wrong in the original

895
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,200
1998, we're stuck in a loop

896
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,920
where for all eternity

897
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,260
it's 7 o'clock in the morning

898
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,380
and nothing has happened.

899
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
Yeah.

900
00:37:52,860 --> 00:38:01,540
Oh, you can say that about me?

901
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:01,540


902
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,120
Well, I hope you're settled,

903
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,120


904
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,120


905
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,120


906
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,460
I'm from Sakura city.

907
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:12,940
I squatted ontzite

908
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,960
and my name is

909
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:14,960


910
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:14,960


911
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,180
is called

912
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,320
says it's seriously reviewing allegations that State Department spokesman Sean McCormick says

913
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,080
that officials say that rocket-propelled protesters barricaded themselves in the

914
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:31,160
health care system. Updating figures from Wall Street 10-2-4-12-2-6-8-1. President Bush has

915
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,360
signed legislation that would provide trained counselors to help PR News, Washington.

916
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:49,100
Now we come to a very important section, one that everyone dreads, sex. Teachers should not

917
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:56,180
thrust on their students rather than pumping in. However, it is the teacher's duty to enlighten

918
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,600
their students' sexual intercourse. Through training, they will realize they are as simple

919
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,140
as ABC. Yes.

920
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,340
So let's get started.

921
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,340


922
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:14,060
Let's start with A. A, B, and C. We may not always succeed in screwing the train of

923
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,640
fools. We must always try.

924
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,620
We have to make sure there's some teabagging involved.

925
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,980
Oh, God. I actually...

926
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,600
Who was that mysterious uniballer?

927
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:34,880
At X Day, why did we end up doing the most low, frat boy-like pranks?

928
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,820
Because we can.

929
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,280
Because we're a little boys club, is what it comes down to.

930
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,860
Exactly.

931
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
We have secret passwords.

932
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,180
We have secret...

933
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,200
We have secret handshakes.

934
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,540
You know...

935
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,220
Well, yeah, of course.

936
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,160
I mean, we are just little boys with our little club, is what it comes down to. And, you know,

937
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,000
I feel really sorry for some people who are...

938
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,100
I've...

939
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,100
You know, Reverend Stang, when I...

940
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,660
One of the things I remember hearing before I got involved with the church was, uh,

941
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,880
join this church and you will get laid.

942
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,040
But that's...

943
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,220
Yeah.

944
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,360
That's really misleading.

945
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,520
Well...

946
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,820
Well, that's how they got me, too.

947
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:04,920
Yeah.

948
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,980
That's really misleading.

949
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,320
People who've not only gotten laid, they've even ended up getting married to some of the

950
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,380
people they got laid by.

951
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,080
But you're certainly not going to pick anyone up at X Day.

952
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,100
No, not...

953
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,320
No, that's not necessarily true.

954
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,260
Jesus and Magdalene met at an X Day.

955
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,060
I met Princess We out there.

956
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,700
Jesus and Magdalene met and fell in love and got married.

957
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,260
Steve Boone and Evie Love met and fell in love at an X Day.

958
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
Lilith and Thea.

959
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah.

960
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,620
Let's see.

961
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,120
Who else?

962
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,140
Oh, Eris.

963
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,620
The late Eris Pagana.

964
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,300
And Reverend...

965
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,040
Reverend D.J.

966
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,700
Farrell.

967
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,620
See, that's odd.

968
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,140
Because every time I've been there...

969
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,320
I thought you'd say Bob.

970
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,420
Because of X Day.

971
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,700
See, every time I've been there, which is, you know, four years in a row now, it's been

972
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,540
a huge sausage fest, basically.

973
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,680
I mean, the only women there were there with their boyfriends or husbands.

974
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,780
Yeah, and they're really good looking, aren't they?

975
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,020
Yeah.

976
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,680
Well, some of them.

977
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,940
Well, how about Jackie?

978
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,120
That pretty hot woman, Jackie?

979
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,580
I don't recall.

980
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,640
Actually, Dr. Semester, there were some...

981
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,420
I noticed some...

982
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,240
Some...

983
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,760
A couple of girls there who didn't seem to be attached to anybody that were...

984
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:09,980
Really?

985
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,080
...about your age.

986
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,860
But I never got a chance to talk to them.

987
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,720
I don't know who they were.

988
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
They were probably pagans.

989
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,180
No, no.

990
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,960
They were definitely subgeniuses.

991
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,160
One of them was a soft blonde.

992
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,520
A big blonde.

993
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,740
And the other one was...

994
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,440
Well, next year, why don't you hook us up with them?

995
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,220
A small one that I had no use for.

996
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,040
Give us your women.

997
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,760
But I was...

998
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,120
Not her.

999
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,740
She needs women.

1000
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,020
Bring her to me.

1001
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Yeah.

1002
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,360
Hey, that has worse.

1003
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:34,860
Sometimes...

1004
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,620
Sometimes that works.

1005
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah.

1006
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,320
That's another thing that works.

1007
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,900
You walk up to some cute...

1008
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,400
Or you meet this nice couple, and you...

1009
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,960
Now, this only works if you're older, a little bit older than the boy and girl involved,

1010
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,040
or tougher.

1011
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,020
And you look at the girl and go,

1012
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,000
Oh, my God, you're beautiful.

1013
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,700
What are you doing with this guy?

1014
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,360
And it's such a...

1015
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,400
That's what I was saying to the rabbi.

1016
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,060
That's what I was saying to Rabbi Jacqueline.

1017
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,740
I'm sorry.

1018
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,260
It's such a hot block that it usually causes the...

1019
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,800
A young man could be tongue-tied and stunned into inaction.

1020
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,760
And the young lady, of course, is just thrilled to be told she's beautiful.

1021
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,860
Well, did you see...

1022
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,520
Did you see Rabbi Jacqueline Hyde dressed as Marilyn Monroe for the deity ball?

1023
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,240
My God, she gave...

1024
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,000
You know, she...

1025
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,620
She got me all like,

1026
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,060
Whoa, I'm jealous of Pristata now.

1027
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,440
Geez.

1028
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:33,300
Now, our listening audience does not know this inside gossip that you're referring to.

1029
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,540
They understand.

1030
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,960
And they're not just the Bob and Connie.

1031
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,120
And here is a rare, rare live recording of Bob and Connie.

1032
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,960
I've been having a low affair with Jerry Springer.

1033
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,980
I've been having a low affair with my dog.

1034
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,440
I've been having an affair with a whale.

1035
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,180
No problem.

1036
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,840
I mean, like, you don't just want to be with someone just because of their penis.

1037
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,340
But unfortunately, Bob and Connie weren't there this time.

1038
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Nope.

1039
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,260
Nope.

1040
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,700
They usually aren't.

1041
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,240
No, they...

1042
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,500
They have better things to do, I guess.

1043
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,560
Or that we know of.

1044
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,400
Right.

1045
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,840
There could always be a Bob in disguise.

1046
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,560
There's so much that we don't know.

1047
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,440
We all pass out sooner or later out there at X-Day.

1048
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,720
Maybe.

1049
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,580
What happens then?

1050
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,280
Maybe.

1051
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,160
If you pass out in the wrong places, you get teabagged.

1052
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,560
I've awakened on the other side of the bed than the one I went to sleep on.

1053
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,860
You know, it could be that Bob is actually there in all of us.

1054
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,960
And that maybe only...

1055
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,580
Only the pagans are the ones who can see this with their little magic tricks or whatever.

1056
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,260
And that's why they refer to us as the Bobs.

1057
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:40,560
That's right.

1058
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,300
Because they look at us and they just see the Dob's head.

1059
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,840
Yeah, they don't call us the Bobbies or the Subdimes or anything like that.

1060
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,520
They call us the Bobs.

1061
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah.

1062
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:55,540
As if they see a bit of Bob in all of us, the boys and the unavailable...

1063
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,460
The girls that are unavailable to you.

1064
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,540
As if we're avatars of Bob's self.

1065
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,520
Yes, perhaps Bob takes over.

1066
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,400
Takes over our bodies.

1067
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,400
Like it's like a body snatcher kind of thing during the time that we're there.

1068
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:17,060
Now, another reason that there appears to you to be a dearth of new bio young ladies is Dr. Philo Drummond is there.

1069
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,820
And he's like a magnet.

1070
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,280
You know, he's the overman.

1071
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,920
He was trained by Bob.

1072
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:31,760
And even though he's like 75 years old now when dames are around him, they just can't...

1073
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,260
He was...

1074
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,380
Chasing him out of his trailer.

1075
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,680
Wow.

1076
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,220
He was chasing him out of his trailer.

1077
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,360
Hal's like, get out of here, young ladies.

1078
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,500
I need my sleep.

1079
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah.

1080
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,060
Wow.

1081
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,720
It's strange.

1082
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,700
Dr. Hal, yeah, the same way.

1083
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,460
Dr. Hal.

1084
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,520
All right.

1085
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,380
Well, at any rate, I'm just pointing out that it shows.

1086
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,860
When you're right with Bob, you have a certain manna about you, a certain halo, as it were.

1087
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,980
It repels human females, yes, admittedly.

1088
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,920
But not...

1089
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,500
Mosquitoes and so forth.

1090
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Actually, it does repel mosquitoes.

1091
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,060
For you.

1092
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,440
Sit amongst a swarm of them.

1093
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,620
Oh, there's some diet ale down there.

1094
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,820
Governor Rocknars arrived with the official drink of X Day.

1095
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,900
Labatt's Blue.

1096
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,800
The Ale Eight.

1097
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,880
Yes, of course.

1098
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,860
You see, the reason being...

1099
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm going to cut with this Labatt's Blue.

1100
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,140
This Ale Eight stuff, it seems to be percolating into everything.

1101
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,580
It's taste saturating everything here.

1102
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,520
It's a little bit of a

1103
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,980
Why is that?

1104
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,360
It's inferior, because it's for those with compromised systems.

1105
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:59,660
But at any rate, the whole idea here is that the eight is the symbol of infinity, upended, as we intend.

1106
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,480
Oh, wait a minute.

1107
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Does that mean we're going to have to...

1108
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,380
Wait forever for X Day to arrive?

1109
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,900
An infinite number of X Days?

1110
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,480
86-61 was bad enough, man.

1111
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,680
That's worthy of consideration, you know.

1112
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,760
We don't just go out there and stand around like cattle.

1113
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,560
We're going to have to finesse our transition.

1114
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:25,240
It will take every ounce of intellect, concentration, and physical strength that we possess not to muff X Day.

1115
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, we already know that Reverend Stang is our own Jane Goodall.

1116
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,260
Yeah, that's true.

1117
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,540
Did you see...

1118
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,260
I saw the scene magazine, or actually the Free Times last week.

1119
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1120
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,420
Starwood made the scene.

1121
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,480
The Free Times.

1122
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,160
It was on the cover.

1123
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:39,580
The Free Times, yeah.

1124
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,200
And they were interviewing people that I knew and talking about people.

1125
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,100
Actually, I think I might even know the guy who wrote it, but I'm not sure.

1126
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,520
I have my suspicions.

1127
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,560
He goes to Starwood, or he was there last time.

1128
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:59,560
And he was real impressed with the Starwood Ashes business that Princess Wee sort of inherited from Raphael,

1129
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,460
the old man of the...

1130
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,980
Mountain.

1131
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,140
You know, I think I might have known Raphael, too, actually.

1132
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,560
I remember seeing him at the first X Day I went to, and I never saw him in subsequent years.

1133
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,800
Oh, he's out there still.

1134
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,800
He haunts the woods.

1135
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,620
He's the wild man that lives in the woods.

1136
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,560
I think he actually initiated me into the cult of the bull.

1137
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,660
Oh, really?

1138
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Now, Dennis Murphy, of course, is the main cult leader of that.

1139
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,860
Uh-huh.

1140
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,300
Who is a different grizzled hipster.

1141
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,100
See, because I don't know...

1142
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,520
He knows Brushwood.

1143
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,920
Brushwood and the Starwood scene is just chock full of grizzled hipsters.

1144
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,440
Yeah.

1145
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,900
I don't know what they do to grizz up like that.

1146
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,400
Years and years of practice.

1147
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,760
A lot of cigarettes when they're younger, I think, is what does it.

1148
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,140
Now, what's it like at Starwood compared to X Day?

1149
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,120
It's like way, way larger crowd.

1150
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,800
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,480
There's over a thousand people there, and it's a completely different thing.

1152
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,040
I mean, most of them are a bit more spiritual-minded, seekers, suckers.

1153
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
They're like nincompoops.

1154
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,440
And people who know how to party like you would not believe.

1155
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,220
It's like an East Coast burning.

1156
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,940
It's about half of them are the kind who hate the Church of the Subgenius

1157
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,900
because we grossly mock their most sacred...

1158
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,920
Well, we laugh in the face of ecstatic happiness,

1159
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,160
which they think should be taken very seriously.

1160
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,300
I think that defeats the whole purpose of it.

1161
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,920
The other half of Starwood, however, are the ones who like having subgenius there

1162
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,760
because...

1163
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:38,220
We kick off the, shall we say, fundamentalist pagans.

1164
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,540
Yeah, the fundies.

1165
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,980
The neo-pagans and half-pagans and nagaps and all the different strange variations.

1166
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,500
I don't know.

1167
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,440
It's a great place for weirdos.

1168
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:49,560
Yeah.

1169
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,900
Cleveland is a reason why I live in Texas.

1170
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,180
Okay, now comb your hair.

1171
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,660
Okay.

1172
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,320
Let's go ahead and take a look.

1173
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,040
Look at white men.

1174
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,840
Paid for by Cleveland.

1175
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:13,240
Anyway, Starwood is a good place to meet creatures...

1176
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,920
I bet.

1177
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,420
...of the opposite or otherwise desired sex, although...

1178
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,600
I hate to say this on the air, but, you know,

1179
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,200
by all accounts that I've heard, pagan chicks are easy.

1180
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,780
Well, Dr. LeGume said if you can't get laid at Starwood, you can't get laid.

1181
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,120
Dr. LeGume says a lot, Rottenar.

1182
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,460
Like any sexist.

1183
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,100
...subgenius preacher or old-timer.

1184
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,980
They say a lot.

1185
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,880
But Starwood is another place that has been a mating ground for...

1186
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,640
Usually, it's subgenius guys and pagan girls,

1187
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,700
but I've known it to happen the other way around,

1188
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,040
where subgenius gals met some pagan fella.

1189
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,540
Now, the hardcore witchy types, they probably don't use latex condoms.

1190
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,220
They probably insist on, like, the sheep intestine kind, don't they?

1191
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,500
You know...

1192
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,720
Oh, actually, that's...

1193
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,020
I think most of them, it's just lip service, you know?

1194
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,060
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1195
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,500
That's what I figured, too.

1196
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,420
I went through a pagan phase myself when I was 15,

1197
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,980
and, um...

1198
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,140
I don't know, you know, I can't help but look at all the pagans I meet today

1199
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,120
as, like, an overgrown version of what I was at 15.

1200
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,180
You know?

1201
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,980
Well, you know, but, um...

1202
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,880
But you gotta credit them for wanting to believe in forces

1203
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,780
that they believe control the universe.

1204
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,360
No, I really can't give...

1205
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,960
I can't give anybody credit for a desire to believe in stuff

1206
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,300
that, you know, that they have no evidence of, you know?

1207
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,500
Well, the thing I've learned about pagans is that there's no such thing as a pagan.

1208
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:40,880
Well, all...

1209
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,780
Because they're all different.

1210
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,840
They're all pagans.

1211
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,040
They're all pagans.

1212
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,860
Christians are pagans, too.

1213
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,260
They haven't...

1214
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,900
They have...

1215
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,240
There's no single belief system.

1216
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,780
There's a zillion little clusters.

1217
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,440
Oh, yes.

1218
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,500
They all have different gods and...

1219
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,940
It's probably best that it...

1220
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,760
Different fairies.

1221
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,580
...that it stay that way.

1222
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,200
Yeah.

1223
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,480
Yeah.

1224
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,940
Yeah.

1225
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,100
Yeah.

1226
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,260
Yeah.

1227
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1228
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1229
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1230
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1231
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1232
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1233
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1234
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1235
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,340


1236
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,000
The age came and look at it.

1237
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,960
I mean, God, give me a break.

1238
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,480
Ugh.

1239
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,980
Now, that's a place that would be a great setting for a novel.

1240
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:10,900
What?

1241
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,620
Starwood?

1242
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,180
Starwood.

1243
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,580
I'm getting ideas for books to write now, like ridiculous things happening.

1244
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,900
There you go.

1245
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,820
That's a great idea.

1246
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,320
I can think of ridiculous pagan drama or something.

1247
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

1248
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,620
Beat them.

1249
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,540
Well, you know, there's...

1250
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,320
There'll probably be a Tom Clancy novel that takes place at Burning Man,

1251
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,880
and you can cash in on that.

1252
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,120
First, I want to let you know that portions of the following...

1253
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,660
...broadcast may be found objectionable by some members of the listening audience.

1254
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,980
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

1255
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:43,240
And the views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB

1256
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,540
or Cleveland State University or anybody, for that matter.

1257
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,460
We're just kind of talking nonsense here.

1258
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,960
So, don't believe us.

1259
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,240
Do not believe a word we say.

1260
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,400
We just have to say that.

1261
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,860
You know, the people who really get it will still get it.

1262
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,040
Got it?

1263
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,140
Well, get this.

1264
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,900
You're listening to The Hour of Slack.

1265
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,620
Number 1003.

1266
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,760
But that clip was from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB.org

1267
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,740
on Sunday nights at 10 after The Hour of Slack in Cleveland.

1268
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,420
Yes, Cleveland.

1269
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,360
Dallas be damned.

1270
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,700
Fort Worth is okay.

1271
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:27,700
Friends, that's Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1272
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, and get this.

1273
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,080
Subgenius.com.

1274
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,680
Last year, every man, woman, and child recently wrote,

1275
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,640
Dear Cleveland, week moving to Iowa, if you succeed.

1276
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,400
I agree with thousands of Iowans who are too high.

1277
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,680
To see the light of day, you must eliminate obnoxious Cleveland.

1278
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,800
It's a wonder anyone stays there at all.

1279
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,520
Paid for by Cleveland.

1280
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,560
But, friends, even if they did come,

1281
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,380
even if the aliens that Bob predicted would come in 1998,

1282
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,420
which obviously hasn't arrived in our true calendar yet,

1283
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,060
even if the aliens came and wiped out,

1284
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,120
or if the humans screwed up so bad

1285
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,840
that we or somebody wiped out all life on the surface of the planet Earth,

1286
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,420
there's still these critters called heat vent worms.

1287
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,040
And, friends, this is the kind of thing that gives me hope.

1288
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,380
Others, you may look into a crystal ball and get hope,

1289
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,740
or go and meditate and talk to God and get hope.

1290
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,260
I get hope from reading about the heat vent worms.

1291
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,440
These creatures are so different from the rest of us,

1292
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,800
they're not even really oxygen-based, or they're carbon-based,

1293
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,080
but that's about as much as they have in common with us.

1294
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,880
They live in the deepest parts of the ocean

1295
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,900
where these volcanic vents have been giving off heat and crud

1296
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,980
and poisonous gases for an eternity.

1297
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,760
And they've evolved to live off of poisonous gases,

1298
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,160
no oxygen at all.

1299
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,580
They wouldn't do well anywhere else except around a heat vent.

1300
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,240
But the important thing is,

1301
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,400
even if the rest of the planet is totally destroyed,

1302
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,260
Bob will still have customers down at the bottom of the ocean,

1303
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,920
and evolution will bring those bastards up.

1304
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,400
It will happen.

1305
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,980
If everybody, if all our great, wonderful consciousness

1306
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,040
was wiped out,

1307
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,300
and even the great apes and even the monkeys

1308
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,860
and even the plankton in the sea were wiped out,

1309
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,360
those damn heat vent worms, give them mad,

1310
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,720
might take a while, might take a whole billion years

1311
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,640
to drive mutated ones out onto the land or something,

1312
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,840
but there is progress.

1313
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,100
If I can get along with my dad as well as I do these days,

1314
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,580
friends, there's hope.

1315
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,020
There's progress.

1316
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,940
All right, I think we're ready.

1317
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,380
Okay.

1318
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,760
We're ready.

1319
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,520
And Bob's here.

1320
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,720
Fuck them good.

1321
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,640
Their pink bright butts will soon be hurting.

1322
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,300
We lived a life that's full.

1323
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,380
We didn't go the pink boy job way,

1324
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:38,480
but more, much more than this.

1325
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,540
We did it Bob's way.

1326
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,820
Regrets.

1327
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,780
We had a few.

1328
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,440
But then again,

1329
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,660
too few to mention.

1330
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,840
We'll cleave their world in two.

1331
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,780
Then blast off to the X dimension.

1332
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,160
Bob's pipe is stiff and hard.

1333
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,600
And it will smite them here on X day.

1334
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,580
Okay.

1335
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:15,740
We'll see you next time.

1336
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:15,740


1337
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:15,740


1338
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:15,740


1339
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,160
I'll pulverize their little world.

1340
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,900
And do it Bob's way.

1341
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,440
There were times

1342
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,000
you often knew

1343
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,880
pink boys beat us black and blue.

1344
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,640
But through it all,

1345
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,880
we didn't stop.

1346
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,460
We took the pills,

1347
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,380
and smoked the froth.

1348
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,120
We faced the con and we moved on.

1349
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,620
And it bobbed away.

1350
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,500
Oh sure, at times we cry.

1351
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,740
But they'll be the ones we'll be abusing.

1352
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,520
Until the last pink boy has died.

1353
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,180
I'm sure we'll find it fucking amusing.

1354
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,500
To think we'll do all that.

1355
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,020
From Bangor, Maine down to Zimbabwe.

1356
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,580
Oh no, oh no not us.

1357
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,480
We'll do it Bob's way.

1358
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,040
For what is a sub?

1359
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,400
What has he got?

1360
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,060
If not some slack.

1361
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,160
Then he has to go.

1362
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,160


1363
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,540
He has not.

1364
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,880
To say the things he truly feels.

1365
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,300
And not the words of those who kneel.

1366
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,680
The record shows we dealt the blows.

1367
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,900
And did it Bob's way.

1368
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,460
Thanks brothers and sisters for coming to the end of the world.

1369
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,380
We are.

1370
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,640
Oh chum.

1371
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,040
Hoo!

1372
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,460
Phineas Narco.

1373
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
From NationalCynical.com.

1374
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,620
That's where you can get more of that.

1375
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,580
NationalCynical.com.

1376
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:36,340
But now, from Le Mure, a public service denouncement.

1377
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,500
No wonder you need personal challenge?

1378
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,320
Try the joint training team.

1379
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,120
You'll receive one new joint.

1380
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:49,060
in Canada. For more information call 1-333 or join in the long run.

1381
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:57,600
And then there's the horrible theory that the subgenie and everything went wrong in the original

1382
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:04,480
1998 were stuck in a loop where for all eternity it's seven o'clock in the morning and nothing has

1383
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,520
happened forever and ever and ever.
