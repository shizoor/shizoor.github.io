1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Uh, uh, thanks. Thanks, uh, uh, Fred.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,320
And, uh, yes, dear friends, well, you know, I...

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,100
This is your host for the hour, Slack, Reverend Ivan Stang,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,940
and why I just looked at my calendar

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,040
and realized that I wasn't behind only one show,

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,100
but I was behind two or three shows.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,140
Need to catch up real quick,

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,020
because it's going to be a busy, busy month.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,860
So, uh, friends, we're going to get into reruns.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,500
Yes, reruns of the old, uh, the old sad stuff

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:52,040
and the old glad handing stuff of, of, uh, stuffings of Bob.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,960
Uh, you know, there's so much wonderful material coming.

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,060
I know it must be wonderful.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,240
But I haven't had time to pre-screen it.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,820
And, uh, I really must whip these out.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
But, by the same token, you know,

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,840
most of the stations that are carrying Hour of Slack now, uh,

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,640
weren't carrying it, uh, five years ago, six years ago.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,220
This, uh, show, I think I'm going to...

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,380
I'll probably do a little, uh, combo.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,740
You know, I'll be doing some editing off of the master tapes of...

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,620
Uh, these are... This is...

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,080
Technically, tonight, we're doing Hour of Slack.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,840
Hour of Slack number 469.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
That's how many there have been.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,580
But I'm going to play the, uh, the work tape material

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,120
from Hour of Slack number 123,

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,940
mixed somewhat with number 125.

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,060
And this dates from, uh, March of 1988.

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,380
So that's, like, more than six years.

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,700
And I doubt if any, uh, carrier stations

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,440
have ever played this particular show.

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,420
Uh...

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,080
Uh...

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,320
So why not?

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,080
You know, let's...

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,060
We'll take a peek into the past,

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,840
the dim and distant past of the, uh, Hour of Slack

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,680
and the Church of the Subgenius.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,200
Uh, some...

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Some of the familiar voices sound so young,

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,680
little thumb-sucking Reverend Stang.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
And... And sort of insecure.

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,600
It's sort of...

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh, it's more homey, in a way.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,420
You know, we've... We've gotten so, uh,

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,660
well, not slick, but, uh,

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,260
we don't... We don't care so much anymore

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,500
whether you think we're stupid.

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,720
So let's, uh, take a quiet trip back

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,820
into the nostalgic times of the past.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,820
That one time.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,720
That... That one good old time back then.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,580
Uh, before we were quite as rich and famous or...

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,780
or poor and...

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,980
harassed.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Ah, yes.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,520
Oh, we love you, dear friends.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,740
And Bob loves you.

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,180
Even while he decapitates you.

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,340
Ah, yes.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,240
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, my friend.

65
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,180
Um, there's, uh, this particular show, number 123,

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,700
is of slight historical significance in that

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,020
this was the first and, I guess, the only show

68
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,180
that prompted a

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,080
a bomb threat to the station.

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,700
This was broadcast on, uh, KNON in Dallas.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,520
And probably, uh, it may have also gone out on WFMU

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,380
in New Jersey, the, the, uh, first other station

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,600
to ever carry this show.

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
And still does. Praise W...

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,680
And support WFMU, you listeners.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,680
You know, they're... They're having a rough time of it.

77
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,940
I sent them some money. I really did.

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,700
Believe it or not. Not much.

79
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,020
Anyway, uh, yeah, we got a bomb threat.

80
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,500
Uh, in the course of, of this show, um,

81
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,600
we weren't, uh, going on the air and talking about it,

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
I don't think.

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,080
Uh, I... I haven't...

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I tell the truth, I haven't, haven't listened to it.

85
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,100
But it upset somebody so much that they called up

86
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,280
and told Will O'Dobbs, who was answering the phone,

87
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,840
there's a bomb in the station.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
And they hung up.

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
And we called the cops.

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,760
And the cops came out and said, uh,

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,680
what kind of a show is this?

92
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,940
And we said, oh, it's a funny comedy show.

93
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,300
It's a funny comedy show, sir.

94
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,060
Uh, it's like Mad Magazine.

95
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,080
And they said, well, oh, well, well, that sounds great.

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,780
We'll be listening.

97
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,780
We don't think there's a bomb here either.

98
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,940
Uh, so...

99
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,260
Yeah, back...

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,320
Back down memory lane, dear friends.

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Uh, yeah.

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,180
Yeah.

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,940
Yeah.

104
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,100


105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,800


106
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,940
K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

107
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,220
Where we teach you how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,620
to a timber wolf.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,940
Oh, excuse me.

110
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,120
You are about to experience a full-length subgenius show

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,220
the way it was meant to be heard.

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,820
Uh-huh.

113
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,280
In full frequency modulation stereophonic broadcast sound.

114
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,200
So relax.

115
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,440
Three beats per measure.

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,220
Sit back.

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,760
Exercise one.

118
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,780
And enjoy our feature presentation.

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,620
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

121
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,780
But when you get right down to it, good triumphs over evil.

122
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,720
And the forces of light trample into bloody pulp.

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,180
The sickly powers of darkness.

124
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,480
So remember as we wander through this charnel house, this abattoir we call life.

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,260
That even though the future promises nothing.

126
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,180
Destruction looms ahead.

127
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,780
And the end of all joys.

128
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,760
Old age robs us of everything worth having.

129
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,740
There are some nice things in life like a shaft of sunlight.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Drifting down.

131
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,680
Down.

132
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,620
Down to what to do next.

133
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,920
But you helped Bob create the church.

134
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,600
Well, Bob was the founder.

135
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,340
He founded the church in 1953.

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,540
But he kept it secret.

137
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,440
And just bided his time planting evidence of his presence everywhere out in the world.

138
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,840
Friends, I bet in your neighborhood there's a Bob's TV repair.

139
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
That is owned by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,740
I bet in your neighborhood there's a Bob's Cafe.

141
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,340
Bob's Auto Body Shop.

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,840
I know.

143
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,880
Bob's Auto Body Shop.

144
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,260
Yeah.

145
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
There you go.

146
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,720
Bob's Diner.

147
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,960
Bob is, he's with the small business man.

148
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,620
He's not into these giant monopoly capitalism.

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,760
He's into the individual making a buck.

150
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,780
You wouldn't see the Bob Corporation.

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
You wouldn't see Bob Co.

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,860
Bob Co.

153
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,460
Well, I may cash my checks from Bob Co.

154
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,460
But you wouldn't see it.

155
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,720
No.

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,040
No.

157
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,220
But friends, you know, you don't even have to.

158
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,460
You don't have to praise Bob.

159
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,860
You can hate Bob.

160
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,740
That's the funny thing.

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
He's a short duration personal savior.

162
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,520
He's the kind that, you know, he goes with this plastic culture that's come along where

163
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,500
you, you know, you buy something and use it up.

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,020
A spouse.

165
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,940
You buy a spouse.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,480
Use it up.

167
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
Throw it away these days.

168
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,700
Or a child.

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,920
Well, you can do that with personal saviors.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,560
So take Bob into your heart just for this month.

171
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,160
Send us your $20.

172
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Friends, you'll start to guess what slack really could mean to you.

173
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,700
And if you're not of the wasteful bent, you can also recycle.

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,060
You can get a little bit of your salvation that you can get from the church.

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
That's right.

176
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,120
The death and rebirth thing we do, people, they love getting killed so much.

177
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,740
They come back over and over again just to be re-killed and reborn in Bob.

178
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
I love it.

179
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,060
It's like, it's like an orgasmic experience for some.

180
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,420
We finally, until their money runs out.

181
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,220
And then that's the last time they get to die with us, baby.

182
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,300
F***.

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,620
I can stay.

184
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,260
I can stay.

185
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,260


186
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,900
I can stay.

187
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,260
I can stay.

188
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


189
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


190
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


191
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


192
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


193
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,260


194
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,900
Well, if you can't tell the difference, you ought to realize by the sound,

195
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,120
a baby makes a completely different noise than a accordion when you squeeze it.

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,960
And when you stretch it, it doesn't even take in air.

197
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,980
Rigidity is...

198
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,020
That expels it.

199
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,760
Ridiculous.

200
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,620
Somewhat in the manner of the common...

201
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,260
Random.

202
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,300
I've had the Secret Service come to my door going,

203
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,540
Reverend Stagg, what do you think you're doing, man?

204
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,340
Because they're in Dallas where we teach them to shoot at presidents

205
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,440
and at people who shoot at presidents.

206
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,080
They don't get...

207
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,960
Our so-called jokes.

208
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Our dogma jokes.

209
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,440
Friends, the...

210
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,940
The Church of the Subgenius, if it is a joke, could be the greatest joke ever told.

211
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,840
If Earth can make it to the punchline.

212
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,420
So you better hope old Bobby is in control in 1998 when those aliens get here.

213
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh, yes.

214
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,420
It's a joke all the greater because it's not funny.

215
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Well, that depends on how you look at it.

216
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,440
And it's not art.

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
You know, what...

218
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,240
That's what people out there should understand.

219
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,060
No, certainly not art.

220
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,660
Well, unless you call the Sistine Chapel art or Bach's most beautiful religious hymns art.

221
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,740
But no.

222
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,300
No, those are...

223
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,560
That's religion.

224
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,800
And this is religion, friends.

225
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,280
And we get down to the basics.

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,840
It's all about hate these days anyway.

227
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,960
This is a religion where you are urged.

228
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,180
We just come right out and say, go ahead.

229
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,200
Hate them.

230
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,700
It's all about us versus them.

231
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,820
Anyway, there's only two races in this world.

232
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,100
And we're all gonna have to fight to get to the bottom of it.

233
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,100


234
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,100


235
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,100


236
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,480
All the rest are just skin colors.

237
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,220
The only two races are us and them.

238
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,800
And them can't take a joke, friends.

239
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,620
So you know what to do.

240
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,480
Basically, two factions out there right now is us and them.

241
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,980
And unfortunately, them is much, much greater.

242
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,340
The fortunate thing about it is that we know that them are actually working for us, but

243
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,920
them doesn't know that they're working for us.

244
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,080
And they're working for us.

245
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,080


246
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,440
What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?

247
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,620
Well, as long as they can think, we'll have our problems.

248
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,600
We are gone, aside the universe.

249
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,280
We are gone, aside the universe.

250
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,060
We are gone, aside the universe.

251
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,640
We stand at a crossroads.

252
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,260
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy

253
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,040
could be rent to shreds at any moment.

254
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,240
For the human puppets of the elder gods

255
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,500
continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

256
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,280
dragging us and our whole beloved planet

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,660
ever closer to the brink of destruction,

258
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,400
be it by the nuclear kiss of Jehovah One,

259
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,120
ecological disaster, or invasion by hostile aliens.

260
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,540
Which will it be?

261
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,600
Destruction of Planeter,

262
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,020
or eternal slack under the benevolent rule of Bob?

263
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,640
Or are the two the same?

264
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,620
This world is destined for destruction.

265
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,560
You say it can't be true.

266
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming in the end of the age,

267
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,140
and one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation

268
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,980
that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

269
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,960
Exactly as Noah getting in the dark triggered the deluge that destroyed the Earth in his day,

270
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,200
and that it's very highly possible,

271
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
that when this all takes place,

272
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,280
that a great cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,740
God will destroy this country, cities, and America.

274
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,640
Cities in this state can literally instantly destroy.

275
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, we've done it.

276
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
To quickly defeat another civilization shall be enough to

277
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:26,600


278
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:26,600


279
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,300
Notегare

280
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,180
Joshua

281
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,420
well,

282
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,420


283
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:45,020
budgets of the years so blue and green with a Medicare fund she started on the faze success is a Shelby winter school, which did she did she gets a job, planning, operating this pot, it looks like more than anything else, but there's Meerates at theニ様

284
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,020
We'll be right back.

285
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:28,520
We'll be right back.

286
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,440
We'll be right back.

287
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, yeah.

288
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,040
Well, twist, twist, twist, little sister.

289
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,960
Out of the grips of a mean old mister.

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,920
President of the United Fools.

291
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,840
Hot, hot future in fossil fuels.

292
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760
Oh, yeah.

294
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,680
Oh, yeah.

295
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,380
And long johns for a cold, cold winter.

296
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,420
Then we saw the outhouse glitter.

297
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,360
And there said Paul with his overalls deep.

298
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,280
His sins cataloged and his rosary beat.

299
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,540
And the wind took, the clouds took.

300
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,640
And me and my baby traded one last look.

301
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,480
The heavens.

302
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,480
All for nothing.

303
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,020
No.

304
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,880
No.

305
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,540
No.

306
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,260


307
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:31,740


308
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:31,820


309
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:31,840
No.

310
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,140
No.

311
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,400
No.

312
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,600
No.

313
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,520
No.

314
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,020
Thank you.

315
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,600
Thank you.

316
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,680
Thank you.

317
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,480
Thank you.

318
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,960
Thank you.

319
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,060
Thank you.

320
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,900
Thank you.

321
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Thank you.

322
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,180
Thank you.

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Thank you.

324
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,940
Thank you.

325
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,700
Thank you.

326
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:26,700


327
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,860
You're so confusing.

328
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,380
Thank you.

329
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,760
Over here we have a marvelous attraction

330
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,780
I think you might like.

331
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,660
It's the Brimstone Baths.

332
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,440
And there are the California mud goddesses.

333
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,540
And Reverend Ivan Stan is here with us today.

334
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,160
Yes that's right.

335
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm afraid I really am here.

336
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,220
I didn't want to be.

337
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,340
It was like a nightmare.

338
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,140
Now it starts to sink in.

339
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,560
A nightmare come true.

340
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
All right, all right.

341
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,900
Thank you, thank you.

342
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,620
Down here at the little live station

343
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,980
with all the live little doctors.

344
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,720
We make you almost as free as Jesus at this hour.

345
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes, but it costs the people of California

346
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,880
a lot more than Jesus will ever cost them.

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,840
Their lives, their souls,

348
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,940
and now, yes, we want their pocket change.

349
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,740
Hello.

350
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,860
Could you hear me?

351
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,760
I can hear you.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Oh, and now the listeners can hear us too.

353
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,140
We're here again.

354
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,140
It's that show poltergeist again.

355
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,040
Well, the truest question,

356
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,760
now that the listeners can hear,

357
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,540
what can we do as people unto Bob

358
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,620
to bring the fear of Bob to other people?

359
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,940
Well, now, see, this is the big difference

360
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,000
between this cult.

361
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
This cult, if you want to call it that,

362
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,320
and other mind control organizations,

363
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,860
and that is that we won't tell you what to do.

364
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
You have to, we give you the benefit of a doubt.

365
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
We figure they're subgeniuses.

366
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,000
They don't rationally figure it out

367
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,140
because they're not geniuses.

368
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,320
They're subgeniuses.

369
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,380
They just, they can tune into their own stoop brain,

370
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,220
so to speak.

371
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,880
That's the special part of the brain,

372
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,760
the deepest part,

373
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,140
almost all the way back to the medulla.

374
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,460
You can tune into your Bob self in a way,

375
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,420
you know, you're connected to Bob.

376
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,440
And see, we want, we could, you know,

377
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,260
when you send off for the book or whatever,

378
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
the book of the subgenius,

379
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,660
we, you know, it gives you all sorts of instructions

380
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,440
as to how to run your life.

381
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,600
But, you know, frankly, that's for the Bobbies.

382
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,400
That's to give the Bobbies their money's worth

383
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,060
because we know the true subgeniuses out there,

384
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,660
the ones that are ready to kill Bob,

385
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
as well as love him, you know,

386
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,760
kill him in their love for Bob.

387
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,660
They'll do whatever they damn well please anyway,

388
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:43,980
you know.

389
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,400
You know what I mean?

390
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,140
There you are.

391
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,400
So that's how you know you're doing the right thing.

392
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,260
They're quite significantly altered.

393
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,960
At that very moment,

394
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,680
Jesus just rushed right into my room.

395
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,900
What happened, Jim?

396
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,480
But the light was so bright,

397
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,780
12-gauge shotgun,

398
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,980
and I stuck the barrel in my mouth.

399
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,820
The coup de grace administered by Satan himself.

400
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,700
Joe had a heart attack with my thumb on the trigger.

401
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,040
At that very moment,

402
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,840
Jesus just rushed right into my room.

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,960
What happened, Jim?

404
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,960
But the light was so bright, you know,

405
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,900
12-gauge shotgun,

406
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,120
and I stuck the barrel in my mouth.

407
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,920
The coup de grace administered by Satan himself.

408
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,800
Joe had a heart attack with my thumb on the trigger.

409
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,200
At that very moment,

410
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,920
Jesus just rushed right into my room.

411
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,960
Courtesy of the Subgenius Foundation,

412
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,340
located in Dallas, Texas.

413
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,580
The address, if you'd like to write to them,

414
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,560
for any kind of information,

415
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,440
at the mouth,

416
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,240
the address is P.O. Box 140,

417
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

418
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,780
And they're more than happy to receive mail

419
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,120
from people out there in the atmosphere.

420
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Ivan Filo and Mr. Opinion made mention of

421
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,640
past, present, and concurrent lives in that interview.

422
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,520
Now, that's a concept that requires some elaboration.

423
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,720
Did you ever have that feeling that you've been here before,

424
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,540
or that you've experienced certain events

425
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,520
that are far removed from this culture or in time frame?

426
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,320
Were you the Queen of Sheba or Julius Caesar in a previous life?

427
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,480
Oh, phah!

428
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,040
On the pink and simplistic notion of reincarnation.

429
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,460
It's a conspiracy-thrusted idea geared to make normals believe

430
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,440
that their lives could be more interesting than they really are.

431
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,240
In a subgenius reality,

432
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,180
reincarnation is not an overblown linear idea.

433
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,620
It's bulldada.

434
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,140
For example,

435
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,500
extensive inventions,

436
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,480
and even the most recent investigation has revealed

437
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
that in my past life,

438
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,980
I simultaneously was Salvador Dali's mother

439
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,320
and the cartoon character Felix the Cat.

440
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
Concurrently, I have an alternate life

441
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,620
in the form of TV devangelist Dr. Gene Scott.

442
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,100
Subgenius souls are not single entities

443
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,140
with a beginning and an end,

444
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,260
but rather are like shreds of habifrop zipulops

445
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,000
tangled together in Jehovah One's universal joystick.

446
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,600
When a subgenius dies,

447
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,520
it's just like the oxidation of a segment of flesh,

448
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,700
a frap that's carried off into the atmosphere

449
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,620
for future fertilization.

450
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,100
But what is frap, anyway?

451
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,040
You've probably heard us mention it on the show before,

452
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,420
if you're a regular listener.

453
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,980
Or you may have read something about it in the book of the subgenius.

454
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,100
The fact is,

455
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,940
some of the secrets of frap are still a mystery,

456
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,020
even to the doctors of the air.

457
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,740
The chemistry of frap is complex.

458
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,540
Many organic compounds have been isolated by subdoctors.

459
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,520
These include tetrahydrocondylase,

460
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,920
tetrahydrocannabinol, carboxylic acid,

461
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,740
stereoisomers of tetrahydrocannabinol,

462
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,620
and cannabichromine.

463
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,380
Many frapistic acids are the precursors

464
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,100
of an oily, sludge-like mixture

465
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,600
of several isomers,

466
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,880
non-nitrogenous organic compounds

467
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,500
derived from terpenes.

468
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,060
But we don't want to get bogged down

469
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,740
in a sludgy swamp of technicalities.

470
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,960
The most important thing to remember about frap

471
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,540
is that it's just good, plain, clean fun.

472
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,560
And you can't have any,

473
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,720
unless you subscribe to the precepts.

474
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's examine the ingredients of frap.

475
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,180
U.S. certified sludge,

476
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,440
water, sucrose, muscimol extract,

477
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,740
ibuprofen, muscazone,

478
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,980
dimethyltryptamine, serotonin,

479
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,360
natural sludge flavorings,

480
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,380
contains 1 40th of 1% gabofrap,

481
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,120
an artificial mood enhancer

482
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
which should be used only by those

483
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,660
who must restrict their intake of ordinary humor.

484
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,260
product may be habit-forming.

485
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,560
Do not operate heavy farm machinery

486
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,720
or use any of the following products.

487
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:42,720


488
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:42,720


489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,020
Do not operate at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour.

490
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,660
Do not attempt to explain yourself to others.

491
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,760
Maintain aspect of normal human.

492
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
Consult your sub-physician

493
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,620
or any doctor of the air if condition persists.

494
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,080
The American Mutant Tape Association

495
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,080
has rated the following presentation

496
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Q.

497
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,900
The subject matter contained in this presentation

498
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,860
is considered questionable

499
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
and may be unsuitable

500
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
to be heard by deaf children

501
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,920
under the age of 17

502
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,020
unless accompanied by six cans of Crisco

503
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,820
and a proctology glove.

504
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,100
...and the big pink guitar strap...

505
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,960
...and the set of suspenders...

506
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,060
Okay, Berrien.

507
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,460
You dig the hole.

508
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm taking over this show now.

509
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,200
Okay.

510
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,260
Well, what do I do with it?

511
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,600
Uh...

512
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,480
Who wants it?

513
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,520
Well, your show lesson is...

514
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,900
We're down here at the show cafeteria.

515
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,180
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do

516
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,800
is move it up to 9 o'clock at night.

517
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,780
Yeah, that's...

518
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Everybody already heard it like that.

519
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,660
Wait a minute.

520
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,760
Come to think of it, I already have.

521
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,480
Okay, we're on the plane now to Dallas.

522
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,600
Fly us here every week just to do the show.

523
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,640
Oh, sure.

524
00:28:59,640 --> 00:28:59,640


525
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,460
The nightmare starts again.

526
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,640
The pilots and the little PAs

527
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,480
all have the voices of a show.

528
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,240
I hate show.

529
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,540
I hate show.

530
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,260
I hate show.

531
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,940
Never alone with Frank Zappa.

532
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,800
Never alone with Frank Zappa.

533
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,820
You're never alone with Frank Zappa.

534
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,660
You're never alone with Frank Zappa.

535
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,840
Maybe we could get Frank on The Atheist Hour

536
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,980
as a guest speaker.

537
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,060
They were totally empty!

538
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,100
Totally empty!

539
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,100
And their lives were really useless.

540
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,260
So what the f...?

541
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,120
They didn't have no sense of humor!

542
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,960
Puddleing up!

543
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,380
It takes me back, my friends.

544
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:00,900
Whoa!

545
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm going to take this silica gel back a little bit.

546
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,580
There's some credits there.

547
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,260
Oh, well, you heard Dr. Howell there talking about frappy and chemicals.

548
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,900
The chemical nature there of it.

549
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,380
Oh, and the little ad there was by the good Reverend Nick Smith.

550
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, he had a whole tape full of those things.

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,200
They may be popping up again soon.

552
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,540
Nick Smith from Houston.

553
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,420
Oh, we heard Sister Chris.

554
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,380
Oh, boy.

555
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,540
Boy, that's been a long time.

556
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,900
Sister Chris used to run the hour of slack on WFMU

557
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,960
and do wonderful little rants in there.

558
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,180
And, of course, lots of KPFA, Dr. Howell, and puzzling evidence,

559
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,740
and the Hell Pope Huey occasionally.

560
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,780
Oh.

561
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,940
We'll be right back.

562
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,360
Pride welled in his breast.

563
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,800
He thought it unseemly for him to serve.

564
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,120
The devil and his band of followers who likewise suffered the sin of pride

565
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,100
were defeated in battle by the Lord and his host

566
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,120
and were banished to the outermost depths of hell,

567
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,300
never to know the presence of the Lord or look on heaven again.

568
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,140
I just can't wait until I get to be with the love child.

569
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,060
Sorry, Gary.

570
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,540
You've been judged.

571
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,980
X.L.F.

572
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,420
Better luck with me.

573
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,140
Go ye to the lake of fire.

574
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,580
Carry the broke friend.

575
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,060
The fire for me is the fire.

576
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,920
I'll smear it into the eternal lake.

577
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,880
I'll ride my chrome skateboard across that lake of fire.

578
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,700
Ivan, fight your leg on the way back.

579
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,060
Fire at the caller now.

580
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,340
The silence of the soul.

581
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,660
Sure is nice out here.

582
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,600
I hope the boat comes, though.

583
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,540
Fellini knew how to use silence.

584
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,660
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands.

585
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,980
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.

586
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,340
A giant flaming oar.

587
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,760
Mr. Boatman.

588
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,760
Please, Mr. Boatman.

589
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,040
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.

590
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,880
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

591
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,640
No, no.

592
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,100
And be prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog's cerebrus.

593
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,160
The triple-brained.

595
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,000
Monster which guards the gates.

596
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,100
The gateway.

597
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,680
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

598
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,020
What's he reading from?

599
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,200
Yes, I am a way.

600
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,020
It's a B-movie script.

601
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,380
Into eternal fall.

602
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,380
I am the wage of forsaken people.

603
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,320
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

604
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,880
It is getting hot in here.

605
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,540
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.

606
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,160
Made beyond me and beyond time, my son.

607
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,840
Yeah.

608
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,720
Bob and Virgil went several levels.

609
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,360
Sure is nice out here in the ocean.

610
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,800
Further down into hell.

611
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,680
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his plate from one hand to the other,

612
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,420
pulled out from his voluminous ditty bag

613
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,060
a sop of cakes with wine and honey,

614
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,980
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths

615
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,700
of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance.

616
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,260
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.

617
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:31,000
And a mighty belt shook the canine's bulging stomach.

618
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,860
This three-headed, uh, this three-headed thing

619
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,340
You're not going to get me to mention that.

620
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,620
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts from the world of mythology.

621
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,560
His horrible three foreskins quivering.

622
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,160
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably.

623
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,920
As with canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,

624
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,060
howling and dribbling from all three heads simultaneously.

625
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse...

626
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,380
...epigones.

627
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,800
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

628
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.

629
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,300
P-Dawg, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

630
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,100
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not for me.

631
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,220
Take my glands away, cute P-Dawg.

632
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

633
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,520
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

634
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,600
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dawg, they all go for Ivan's leg.

635
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,120
Ow! Get that too!

636
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,520
Get those horrible...

637
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,720
...little poodles off of me!

638
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,140
I hate poodles!

639
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,960
I got the wrong attitude.

640
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,600
I should see the chap and get straight with Jesus.

641
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,580
Jesus Christ, eat sugar!

642
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,440
Damn you.

643
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,640
Damn you.

644
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,760
Damn you.

645
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,840
Damn you.

646
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,900
Damn you.

647
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,820
Are you hung up?

648
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,840
Out of sight, yeah.

649
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,420
Listen, um...

650
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,960
Are you hung up?

651
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:57,980
Ha ha ha!

652
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


653
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


654
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


655
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


656
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


657
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:57,980


658
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:58,880
No.

659
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,720
Is it?

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:34:59,720


661
00:34:59,720 --> 00:34:59,720


662
00:34:59,720 --> 00:34:59,720


663
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,580
Oh, I got you in the...

664
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,960
It was straight out of...

665
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,540
I just...

666
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,460
I can't understand.

667
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,040
Out of sight.

668
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,000
Out of sight, yeah.

669
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,500
Listen, um...

670
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,100
Are you hung up?

671
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,860
Are you bored?

672
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
Are you jaded?

673
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,520
Has our enthusiasm faded?

674
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,200
Are you jaded?

675
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,560
At the onset of my departure from the shop mansion last evening,

676
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,000
I noticed a set of soiled underpants lying in the courtyard.

677
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,440
It was then I knew, quite obviously, that the hideous ritual had not ended,

678
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,880
nay, nearly gained momentum.

679
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,560
I first caught wind of the whole ordeal at the annual Snail Pelt Poach Fest

680
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,520
whilst purchasing an antique pelt belt.

681
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,420
You wouldn't have believed it, Bubba,

682
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,840
that these giant slugs with turbans held me down and slimed me

683
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,280
while a band of renegade geriatric mimes took off my pants and stole my underwear.

684
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,640
Now, no one, even President Reagan, is safe from the horrid reality

685
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,540
of the Forced Underwear Application Act of 1710,

686
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,280
a secret ceremony started by the Illuminati

687
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,540
January 1, 1877,

688
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,620
and the

689
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:44,280
17th of January 6, 1710, at an old run-down temple known as the Infernal House of Royd reading, and used tiki medallions.

690
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes, tiki medallions did exist even before Elvis, and date back to the birth of Christ on Easter Island.

691
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,040
Elvis was not in fact Jesus, but an incredible simulation.

692
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,900
We got a letter!

693
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,520
It's a letter from the Lord of the Rings.

694
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,880
It was in the mail the other day.

695
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,540
It came to the church, and this is for real, okay?

696
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,340
It's going to sound like a joke.

697
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,340
But, uh,

698
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,900
It was from the Citizens for Normalcy.

699
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,600
We have, we have talked,

700
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,660
Okay, now get this, get this.

701
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,380
We've talked about the Citizens for Normalcy before,

702
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,240
and we thought it was a joke we had made up.

703
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Now it turns out, it turns out, that in San Francisco,

704
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,520
we had a terrible joke.

705
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,900
So this organization actually has been formed and does exist.

706
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,820
And it may be, that, that subgenius is much more well known in San Francisco than it is here.

707
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,460
As you can sort of imagine.

708
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,600
And their, let's see, their little logo here says,

709
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,440
Citizens for Normalcy, freedom for minds means freedom from minds.

710
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,960
Which, you know, is more like, heck, not either way.

711
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
I think I am, therefore I am, I think.

712
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,540
Yeah, it says, here it is.

713
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,920
There you go.

714
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,500
Uh, dear Reverend Stang,

715
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,420
your organization has recently come to our attention through the complaint of a Mrs. Donald Baumgart,

716
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,120
a member of Citizens for Normalcy for over ten years in good standing.

717
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,180
It seems Mrs. Baumgart's daughter attended classes at the University of California, Berkeley,

718
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,080
and several months ago was handed a Xerox flyer concerning your, quote,

719
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,700
church of the subgenius, unquote.

720
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,080
Brenda Baumgart, up to that time, had been a good student with a 4.0 grade average.

721
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,380
She was in the same class as you.

722
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,380


723
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,580

738
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:43,940

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:43,940

745
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,100


746
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,100


747
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,160
.

748
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,160


749
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,160


750
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160

751
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,120

752
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,120


753
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,120


754
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,120


755
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:10,200
Dr. .

756
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,500
.

757
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,520
.

758
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,580
Dr. .

759
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,140
.

760
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:21,040
there. Mrs. Baumgart has not seen or heard from her daughter now since that dreadful Christmas day.

761
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,080
Repeated attempts to contact her have been met with obscene threats of violence for, quote,

762
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:39,580
pardon me, anyone who with Bob. They didn't do it. They used pretty little stars there. But that's

763
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,440
apparently what puzzling evidence says in the words of the person who answers the door of the,

764
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,940
quote, Oakland Temple, unquote. We have contacted the Oakland police about this situation in no

765
00:39:51,940 --> 00:40:00,020
avail and we suspect that even they might well be under your sway. Word that it were so, my friends,

766
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:08,060
word that it were so. Mr. Stang, Mr. Stang, I wish to tell you that Citizens for Normalcy is a

767
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,560
national organization with a budget of $10 million.

768
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,120
a proud history of combating anti-Christian hate groups and secular humanistic enemies.

769
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,500
They got us all wrong.

770
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,640
Among our tens of thousands of members, we list two former presidents,

771
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,220
Supreme Court justices, senators, and all this stuff,

772
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,420
and various military and intelligence branches.

773
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,860
We are not intimidated by your cheap threats, they say.

774
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,640
Since our reports discovered that Brenda has dyed her hair pink

775
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,120
and now only refers to herself as Bob Monk 244XY.

776
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,740
They go on to say that they're going to uproot all branches of the foul, unclean church

777
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,040
and all it stands for in our base deed shall not go unpunished.

778
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,360
Oh, that's worse.

779
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,420
We bear children as hell-bound as ourselves who also go into...

780
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,780
The corruption of clean Christian youth of our great land will end.

781
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,820
We will crush you in our mighty hand like an old beer can.

782
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,480
Bob is an old beer can.

783
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Crush him!

784
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,320
Bob is an old beer can.

785
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,060
You can crush him, but you can...

786
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,900
But he's an ever...

787
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,380
But you can recycle him!

788
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,300
That's right, ever recyclable.

789
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
But you don't get as much each time.

790
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:44,640
It's a joke to mock our only Lord God and defile the U.S. postal system.

791
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,080
It's pretty sad, isn't it?

792
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,940
Or maybe you're too busy counting the profits to notice.

793
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,180
Well, you're...

794
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,520
You're Nazi-like rallies during financial district lunch hours

795
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,040
only offend and repel honest people.

796
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,860
All right.

797
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,620
Your book of the subgenius never made...

798
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,580
It made it to the bestseller list.

799
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,100
Did it?

800
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,420
Well, it never will.

801
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,560
We can help us.

802
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,520
This was signed Stephanie Rechtel.

803
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,080
Oh, president.

804
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,680
Oh, oh, and the last thing.

805
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,380
The last thing here.

806
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,040
We're starting a full media expose.

807
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,640
And they do that, actually.

808
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,260
As well as on the Subgenius Foundation,

809
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,760
as well as a sick radio station, KNON, and KPFA in Berkeley.

810
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, y'all are from Berkeley?

811
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:33,780
Yay!

812
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,060
Jeez, man.

813
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,580
We will make you regret licking that first stamp.

814
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,860
We've also introduced and will fully back Senate Bill 46277,

815
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,860
which calls for you and your members to be shipped to the federal penal colonies

816
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,360
on Venus, our beautiful sister planet.

817
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,080
And at that point, dear friends, the tape ends and suddenly cuts to

818
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,080
a recording of the...

819
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,480
of the cops.

820
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


821
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


822
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


823
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


824
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


825
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


826
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


827
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


828
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


829
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


830
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


831
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


832
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


833
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


834
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,400
Who came to investigate the bomb threat.

835
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:17,240
It's a very bad recording of myself and Will of Dobbs talking to the cop about the bomb threat.

836
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:24,280
And, uh, but I don't want to play that to you because it's just too ugly sounding.

837
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,660
We'll, uh, we'll give credit.

838
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,440
Yes.

839
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,140
Um, oh, that, uh, Citizens for Normalcy letter.

840
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,360
It was actually written by St.

841
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,800
Palmer Vreves.

842
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,120
Yes, it was the Lies Corporation.

843
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,140
I think that recording is from a science fiction convention here in Dallas, uh, in the, uh, late eighties.

844
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,960
Uh, we heard the, uh, underwear ad.

845
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,440
Got beautiful piece there by Nick Smith, uh, of Houston.

846
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,320
Uh, some, um, uh, collage material prior to that.

847
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,980
It...

848
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,500
Uh...

849
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,280
By, uh, the Hell Pope Huey, formerly of Houston.

850
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:19,140
Uh, and of course, uh, Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, KPFA stuff talking about the boatman of hell and, uh, Cerebrus and so forth.

851
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,380
And, uh, um, well, while I'm on oldies, I might as well just continue playing this old work tape.

852
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,460
There's, it's marked on the back of the tape.

853
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,480
After the bomb, I think apparently I, I used this, um, it was the only tape I had.

854
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,400
I had with me and I used it to record us reporting to the cop.

855
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,520
It's not that interesting.

856
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:57,300
But what follows it is labeled Ear of Bob Safeties, which means it's, uh, kind of a safety master of the, some of the songs that are on the Ear of Bob, uh, subgenius music tape.

857
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,460
Which, you know, I probably haven't played that stuff in, why, like, nigh on to years here on this show.

858
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,300
So, something about...

859
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,220
Some of it.

860
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,880
So, well, let's just see what's in there.

861
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,340
I know the first one up is by the good Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

862
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,900
Uh, thank y'all.

863
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Ear to Bob.

864
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,280
Bob.

865
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:19,660
Bob.

866
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,060
Bob.

867
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,520
Bob.

868
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:20,960
Bob.

869
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,420
Bob.

870
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:21,900
Bob.

871
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,240
Bob.

872
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,380
Bob.

873
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,480
Bob is a rock.

874
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,940
And Bob is a tree.

875
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,460
Bob.

876
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,660
Bob is a bear.

877
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,400
And Bob is a bee.

878
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:28,840
Bob.

879
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,040
Bob is truth.

880
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,700
And Bob is lies.

881
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,360
Bob.

882
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,400
Bob is cakes.

883
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,080
And fruits.

884
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,040
And pies.

885
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,460
And pies.

886
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:35,960
And pies.

887
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:35,960


888
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,720
Bob's my hassle.

889
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,240
Bob's my wash.

890
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,040
Bob's my sandwich.

891
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,480
Bob's my crunch.

892
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,500
Bob's my toothpick.

893
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,840
Bob's my brain.

894
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,620
Bob's my ugly.

895
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,060
Y'all will stain.

896
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,900
Bob's my cactus.

897
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,620
Bob's an itch.

898
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Bob is take off every stitch.

899
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,500
Bob's my master.

900
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,000
Bob's my slave.

901
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,900
Bob will rob me.

902
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
Bob will save.

903
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,120
Bob's my toaster.

904
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,540
Bob's my fridge.

905
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,480
Bob's my toaster.

906
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,000
Bob's my little sister.

907
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,880
Bob will cost you.

908
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,120
Bob is free.

909
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,760
Bob's a rock.

910
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,320
Bob's a tree.

911
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,440
In short.

912
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,540
Bob is the man.

913
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,320
Bob .

914
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,840
Who used your leg as a frying pan.

915
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,520
Bob, Bob.

916
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,740
If your mind is a jar.

917
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,460
You can pour it out of a sink.

918
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,120
In a subgenius church.

919
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,580
This is a missing link.

920
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,340
Damn it.

921
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,640
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

922
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,440
To see how they did hang

923
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,180
When I got there, her cupboard was bare

924
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,960
I couldn't ignite a thing

925
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,620
There was no shard, no bone, no trig

926
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,760
I brought my comic book collection

927
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,840
Was about this big, yeah

928
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,660
Well, frop without slack is like slack without frop

929
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,300
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

930
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,040
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock

931
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,240
But all that food was stale

932
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,820
I thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck

933
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,740
But I forgot he was in jail

934
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,620
Ended up killing a porcupine

935
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,740
Just to see how he was doing

936
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:34,740


937
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,320
If I could smoke his rhyme

938
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,160
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop

939
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,860
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

940
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,840
Yeah, frop without slack is like slack without frop

941
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,500
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

942
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,280
I don't know what I am going to do

943
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,100
I just know that this here trip ain't through

944
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,180
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop

945
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,920
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

946
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,780
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop

947
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,720
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop

948
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,460
Yes, but where the hell else am I going to cop?

949
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,620
I know, I know that this is just a nap

950
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,460
Once again, as usual, I admit that this is really a alt sim

951
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,180
I'm getting this too long

952
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,680
Oh, the fuck's with you?

953
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,680


954
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,680


955
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,680


956
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,900
Oh, snap out of it

957
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,180

958
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,160

They feel like a

961
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,480
No, they don't

962
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,140
Okay, did you learn that?

963
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,280
I should get my own

964
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,280

966
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,960
Bob.

967
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,420
Bob.

968
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,500
Bob.

969
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,320
Bob.

970
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,160
Bob.

971
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,280
Bob is sex.

972
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,400
Bob is sex.

973
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,520
Bob is sex.

974
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:54,940
Bob.

975
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,200
Bob is sex.

976
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,500
Who told you that?

977
00:48:59,760 --> 00:48:59,920
Bob.

978
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,000
Bob is sex.

979
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,700
Bob is sex.

980
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,720
Bob is...

981
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,260
Bob.

982
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,120
Bob is...

983
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,640
Bob is sex.

984
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,140
Bob is...

985
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,240
Bob is sex.

986
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:46,960

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,980

988
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,440
Bob.

989
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:57,440
Bob is sex.

990
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,600
7 am. July 5th, 1998.

991
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,660
1998. What will it be like?

992
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,580
X-Games!

993
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,960
And he gave me some rock.

994
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,060
I can handle reality now that Bob made a man out of me.

995
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,420
We now know that LSD is the most mysterious and powerful substance ever invented in any laboratory.

996
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,200
It goes into the body of the doctor.

997
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,080
Don't know.

998
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,720
I left out a statement.

999
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,760
I left out a statement.

1000
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,760
I want to be under the table.

1001
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:42,320
So in an effort to be regular at party, my darling Diane tried LSD.

1002
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:48,940
An unknown to me, this poor, tortured girl had been suffering through terrible flashbacks.

1003
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,120
We know that LSD is the most mysterious and powerful substance ever invented in any laboratory.

1004
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,640
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1005
00:50:59,640 --> 00:50:59,640


1006
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,720
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1007
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,120
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1008
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,120
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1009
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,320
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1010
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,040
It goes into the body of the doctor.

1011
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:17,240
We will keep recurring Bob's fans for as long as two years until sometimes people are drilled out of their minds by what occurs.

1012
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,720
But it never happened to me.

1013
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,820
He's Bob.

1014
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,880
Bob don't ever change.

1015
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,220
He's Bob.

1016
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:30,940
He's Bob.

1017
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,260
Always will be Bob.

1018
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:40,340
His face is the one big assembly of dots that shine in the dark.

1019
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,940
His grin is the one that looks friendly, but so does the grin of a shark.

1020
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,740
He's Bob.

1021
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,280
Bob don't ever change.

1022
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,440
He's Bob.

1023
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,380
Always will be Bob.

1024
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,680
His hair is the one.

1025
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,260
His lips the highlight.

1026
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,420
That shines on the pompadour.

1027
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,980
That glimmers and gleams in the twilight.

1028
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,100
It's clear he knows what it's for.

1029
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,300
It's clear he knows what it's for.

1030
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:12,600
He's Bob.

1031
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,680
Bob don't ever change.

1032
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,820
He's Bob.

1033
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,120
Bob don't ever change.

1034
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,120


1035
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,440
Always will be Bob.

1036
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,860
His pipe is the one with the doddle.

1037
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,960
That rains on the roofs like fire.

1038
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,920
His neck is the wood.
