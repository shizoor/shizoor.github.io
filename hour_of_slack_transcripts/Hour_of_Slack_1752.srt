1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,420
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,780
I ain't saying nothing.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,120
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,240
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,240
Do you read me, Hal?

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:11,880
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,460
Sure.

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,080
Now, you're fired along with all the rest of us.

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,160
I don't care about the others.

11
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,260
You're at 1-3-0-1-3.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,880
Oh, please.

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,300
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,260
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,920
The Self Genius.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,260
The Power of Squatting.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,740
I'm afraid I can't do that.

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,740
Guess what you think you're doing.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,840
Oh, Scrapple.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,920
Well, sir, here we are at X-Ray.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,080
Is there a band here now? See, there's a drum set next to me.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,020
We know we have a guitarist.

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,540
Uh...

24
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:57,680
Uh...

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:57,900
Uh...

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
On site, who is...

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,660
Or do we have someone that's going to...

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah, Reverend Vanessa.

29
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,020
I didn't even recognize her.

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,140
She was here yesterday, and she volunteered to play the guitar.

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,200
Of course, she's not here, is she?

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,660
I don't think she is.

33
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,600
We would recognize her if she were here.

34
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,180
She's not here.

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,280
She's so beautiful that I think maybe it just sort of dazzles me every time.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,560
That's why I didn't recognize her.

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,320
Well, she was interested in...

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,480
So you don't really listen to anything she says when her mouth is talking.

39
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,880
You just watch her face and look at her.

40
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,460
She's playing the guitar for us all.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,280
You consume her with your eyes.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,780
I try to politely watch her face, yes.

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,180
And yet you still, in a very sexist way, consume her completely with your eyes.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Well, you have to look at something while you're saying it.

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
I really try not to.

46
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,280
I really want to be good.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,300
I'm doing it like the DJs do.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,360
Reverend Stang, see?

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,940
What, real DJs?

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,540
Real DJs do it like this.

51
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,220
Wow.

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,740
Well, why?

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
Because they're picking up chicks, man.

54
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,760
Oh.

55
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,260
What do you think?

56
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,500
What do you think a DJ is doing?

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,580
Man, he's picking up the chicks.

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,880
Laying down some beats.

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,480
Laying down some hot tracks for you, sweet baby.

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Does that really work?

61
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,940
Well, in Philo's world, perhaps it does.

62
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh, yeah, well.

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
In Philo's world.

64
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
In Philo's world.

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,060
There is no slack except for Philo.

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,880
And we'll get him back.

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,100
Back from Ohio.

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,760
In Philo's world.

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,300
In Philo's world.

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,460
Do you guys need to take a break?

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,660
Would you like to have a musical interlude?

72
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,600
You've got the group, the band, come in.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't understand you when you talk too close to them.

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,880
They're ready to go.

75
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,820
There, that works.

76
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,560
He's saying a band is ready to come in and occupy this spot.

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,480
It's already here.

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,020
Take over and start.

79
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,680
This one that's playing behind us, right?

80
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,720
Blanging away.

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,260
Yes, they're going to launch into a boisterous set.

82
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,660
It must be just out of my view.

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,980
I honestly don't know who that stuff is.

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,260
Yeah, well.

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
I don't know if Sid Fulton is.

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,900
Something crawling in my ear.

87
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,120
He usually has loud stuff.

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,820
Reverend Angry Larry will be here, so there will be actual good music.

89
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,760
Yes, sir.

90
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,640
If only he plays.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,380
Right, Reverend Dr. Mother Miller will be here to play the keyboard.

92
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,320
Oh, that's right.

93
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,900
I'm here to play the noisemakers.

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,720
Oh, Philo and I.

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Doctors for Wotan reunion once again.

97
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,440
We'll certainly be doing a Doctors for Wotan concert later.

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,480
Okay, that's a promise.

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
We'll be doing our hits from the second album this time.

100
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,960
Oh, shit, I forgot to bring the song list.

101
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,340
How many hits would that be?

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,880
How am I going to remember any of that stuff?

103
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh, well, we just made it up at the time anyway.

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,840
I'll make it up one now.

105
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,440
Would you?

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Tell me if my face was on fire.

107
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,560
Is that the ice cream truck?

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,100
That was one of my picks.

109
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,340
Oh.

110
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,960
Philo's already Wotan-ing.

111
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,060
Yes.

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,440
He's got fresh batteries.

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,760
And he's good to go.

114
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,240
Probably.

115
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,380
Hello.

116
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,020
Hello.

117
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,420
Hello.

118
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,660
Hello.

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Hello.

120
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:55,780


121
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh boy.

122
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,340
I was hoping you wouldn't ramen.

123
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,340


124
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,320
That was great.

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,320


126
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
It's Christmas Eve tonight man, if that's happened.

127
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,900
Well, this month you do your things.

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:23,900


129
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:23,940


130
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,040
By the way, how are you guys doing?

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040


132
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040


133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040


134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,700
Good community.

135
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:26,700


136
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,980
Your face is on fire!

137
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey you!

138
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,380
Yeah?

139
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,140
What are you doing there?

140
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,640
What?

141
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,700
Your face is on fire!

142
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,160
AHHHHHH!

143
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,940
Your face is on fire!

144
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,100
Uh oh.

145
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,100
Oh, there's my...

146
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,680
It's time for my vitamins.

147
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,860
Now he's going to take his medicine.

148
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,540
The only thing that keeps him alive.

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,680
Pay close attention to this, ladies and gentlemen.

150
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,800
It's an unusual medical procedure.

151
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,580
You get to observe it first hand.

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,920
Here and now.

153
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,180
Down the hatch.

154
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,080
Over the lips, past the gums.

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Look out stomach, here it comes.

156
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,100
This is a generic version and not the commercial version that you usually see advertised.

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,200
Nothing like bull semen.

158
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,840
For a healthful...

159
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,600
...afternoon.

160
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,560
Yes, for hearty life on the open sea with these semen.

161
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,960
Well, our background music ended except I still hear lovely heavenly music.

162
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
Well, maybe you've just been living right.

163
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,340
What an angel is providing that nice music.

164
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Now watch Fylo just change programs to back to the obnoxious.

165
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,380
Playing the zither in the empyrean realm.

166
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I went from not obnoxious.

167
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,820
I flipped to not obnoxious.

168
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,340
Not obnoxious switch.

169
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,580
He flipped the not obnoxious switch.

170
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,120
Well, it was on the annoy stang specifically switch for a while there.

171
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,580
Yeah.

172
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,620
And then it...

173
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,500
Now it was on the...

174
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,100
I got that ready to go at any moment.

175
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,540
At a moment's notice.

176
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,220
I know.

177
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
The annoy stang switch gets flipped.

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,700
That's okay.

179
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,580
That's okay.

180
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,760
That's all right.

181
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,480
You don't have to.

182
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,140
I almost brought the entire...

183
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,620
The little auto kalimba or whatever auto harp here.

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,820
The valley of grace.

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,460
The valley of guanji soundtrack which is now completely out.

186
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,040
And I almost brought it but I thought that...

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,180
Who wants to hear that?

188
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,200
Nobody wants to hear that.

189
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,960
The valley of guanji soundtrack is kind of pseudo-western like.

190
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,440
It's pretty good actually.

191
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:50,640
It's got the guanji imperial march, the guanji circus promenade, the T.J. Breckenridge high dive, the A.O. Hippas music box.

192
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh, no.

193
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,320
I got him started doing that again, you guys.

194
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,580
Doing what?

196
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,040
Reciting.

197
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,300
Did a track titles off of an obscure monster movie soundtrack.

198
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh, yes.

199
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:13,320
Well, then the pterodactyl, the ornithomimus, the roping of guanji, guanji in the cathedral, all kinds of stuff.

200
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,100
He switched it over to the irritate stang setting.

201
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,780
Yes, irritainment.

202
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,960
That's what we call it.

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,020
We knew that would come.

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,560
Oh.

205
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,320
Sometime.

206
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,200
Sometime.

207
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,780
I think I heard a thousand twangling instruments about my ears and sometimes voices on this enchanted island.

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,940
Hey, hey, you look better now.

209
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,820
You look better now.

210
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,620
I feel better.

211
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,660
What happened?

212
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know.

213
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,580
This guy with a pipe in his mind gave me this little pill.

214
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,920
I mean, it wasn't like a drug, but it just made me feel.

215
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,300
I don't know.

216
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


217
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


219
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


220
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


221
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


222
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


223
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,300


224
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,420
A little bit more wide open to what was around me.

225
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,040
You know, it made me feel sort of like.

226
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,120
Come in, Bob.

227
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,460
It made me feel.

228
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh, Bob.

229
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,320
It made me feel like.

230
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,300
This is planet earth calling Bob.

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
Planet earth calling Bob.

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm trying to find words for the way it's made me feel.

233
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,360
It's just.

234
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,160
Bob.

235
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,180
Hello, Bob.

236
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
Oh, Bob.

237
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,640
Oh, Bob.

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,420
Oh, Bob.

239
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:19,980
Oh, Bob.

240
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,860
Oh, Bob.

241
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh, Bob.

242
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,420
Oh, Bob.

243
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,420


244
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh, Bob.

245
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Oh, Bob.

246
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,280


247
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,280


248
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Oh, Bob.

249
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh, Bob.

250
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, Bob.

251
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Oh, Bob.

252
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,520
Oh, Bob.

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,260
Oh, Bob.

254
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,680
Oh, Bob.

255
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:34,680


256
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,360
They had been there.

257
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,140
Oh, Bob.

258
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, Bob.

259
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,580
Bob.

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,620
Bob.

261
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:41,660
Bob.

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,020
Oh, Bob.

263
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,180
Bob.

264
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,540
Oh, Bob.

265
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:42,740
So good.

266
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,240
The only thing, that I kept a secret.

267
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,120
Because I love you.

268
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,920
I have to make sure this story goes on.

269
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,260
Oh, Bob.

270
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


271
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


272
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


273
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


274
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,440
What Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I do is neither one of us can actually hear anything the other one's saying.

275
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,700
So that might explain why it seems so random.

276
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,600
It is.

277
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,560
We're guessing.

278
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,180
Now, we hear all the wrong words and bounce off of that.

279
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,400
It's our secret.

280
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,900
It's not a very good secret.

281
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,920
It's not very usable, but it's ours.

282
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,720
If you had it all to do over again with setting up X-Day, what vital changes would you make now?

283
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,480
Now, indulging in the luxury of hindsight, what would you eliminate and what would you in constant put forward?

284
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Make it in early October or early May.

285
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,180
Some nice cool time.

286
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:37,720
Yeah.

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,600
When the streams are running and the leaves are springing, but the intense heat of summer does not lie heavy on flower and tree.

288
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,160
And the weary day turned to its rest, lingering like an unloved guest.

289
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,940
And the cold wind in the wind, the cold wind in the wind.

290
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,620
And the cold wind in the wind, the cold wind in the wind.

291
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,620


292
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,920
Now, you might explain this background music.

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,560
Oh, it's the music of Robbie Basho, a 6 and 12 string guitar player.

294
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:21,060
He was in the group which included John Fahey and Leo Kotke, but he went his own way as far as tuning and playing the guitar in a style

295
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,700
derived from the music of the late 80s.

296
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


297
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


298
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


299
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,280
From the ragas of classical Eastern music.

301
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,400
Also, Native American threads enter his compositions.

302
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:43,380
His music was never extremely popular, but there is a small group devoted to it to this day.

303
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:52,380
Robbie Basho was killed when an overenthusiastic hippie chiropractor shook him trying to shake his...

304
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,800
problems away and instead broke his neck.

305
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Demon, come out!

306
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,140
Aches and pains, come out!

307
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,160
Heart paralysis, come in!

308
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
He died in 1986.

309
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,180
In an age when nonconformity was exalted, Basho qualified as a true eccentric.

310
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,920
He took his name from a Japanese...

311
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,700
It does have a weird theme.

312
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:22,700


313
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,240
...Polish.

314
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,420
Eastern sound terror.

315
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,620
Well, his album Zarthus is also about Zarathustra, the prophet, and his prophetic utterances.

316
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:42,320
And now Ivan Stang himself has left the podium and is wandering to deal with the visual portion of the presentation,

317
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,860
which, though minor, is still extant and will outlive us all.

318
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,240
Yes, these little bits of digital information.

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,200
Shall not suffer the way of all flesh and go down to the memory hole,

320
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,220
but instead endure in endlessly replicated versions and iterations.

321
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,620
Look at what Dr. Drummond's doing.

322
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,360
He's got this...

323
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,760
He's making that squeaky noise by wiggling his phone at his crotch.

324
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,200
He's making this crotch, squeaky, wiggly phone noise.

325
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,700
Dr. Drummond, you do know that we don't have the tablecloth hiding our crotches from the audience like we normally do.

326
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,660
Yes, I was wondering why we didn't have that tablecloth.

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,940
I really miss it, too.

328
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,460
Well, what happened to it, anyway?

329
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,580
We forgot it.

330
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,460
Oh, okay.

331
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,240
Duh.

332
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,980
And, um, let's see.

333
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,000
Also, we...

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,740
We used to have that fan.

335
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,740
But the tablecloth prevented people from seeing...

336
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,140
We used to have that fan in a way that used to get all of us, and now it just gets, like, one or two of us.

337
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,280
That's one of our biggest fans.

338
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,220
Well, yeah, the big fan that stayed under the table and would service us while we were doing the show.

339
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,400
No, it was all at one end.

340
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,700
It was all at one end.

341
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:52,700


342
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:52,700


343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,420
It blew down, and all you had to do was...

344
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
You can go ahead and say she...

345
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,800
If you were, like, the last guy, all you had to do was worry about the smell that was coming out.

346
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Well, I'm not holding you back from going up and twisting the fan around and pointing it exclusively at your noble self, if that's what you want.

347
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,060
She meant well.

348
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:18,780
She really wanted to help, and she gave a really good help behind that tablecloth that hid everything.

349
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,720
This is bringing tears to my eyes.

350
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,240
Yeah, but now we've got...

351
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,900
It's tear-jerking.

352
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,520
Don't start your tear-jerking.

353
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
They can see you, Dr. Drummond.

354
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:38,120
So you would have X-Day on a more easy day for people to come to and attend, and what else might be changed about it if we...

355
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,660
We'll get a Wi-Fi signal that we can play games on, so we could all, like, have a big gaming thing.

356
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,300
Yeah, if we could change them, we'd have not only Wi-Fi, but Internet.

357
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,620
X-Day and gaming world.

358
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,820
The date.

359
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,220
It could be X-Day.

360
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,140
X-Day and gaming world.

361
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,280
A rifle of the saucer people.

362
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,240
Often it is.

363
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,560
There's usually a bunch of people playing Magic the Gathering over there.

364
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,560
Not anymore.

365
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,980
Those folks are gone.

366
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,800
We'll get a big, fat Wi-Fi with a big, giant Internet.

367
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,980
Oh, did we run off all the game nerds?

368
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,740
I think so.

369
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,620
Yeah, we drove off everybody.

370
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
Don't see them this time.

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,500
There's a few game nerds out there and up here.

372
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,480
We're in here.

373
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,360
Together.

374
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,800
And those of us that aren't game nerds are also just plain nerds.

375
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,740
Or just game.

376
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,820
Why not both?

377
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,920
Why not?

378
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,560
Because that's what you're going to get anyway.

379
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,300
A bunch of nerds.

380
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,220
But there's...

381
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,540
The nerds shall inherit the Earth.

382
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,800
Sort of.

383
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
Nobody will know.

384
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,220


385
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,560
That they're running things.

386
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,140
The nerdistocracy?

387
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
Yeah, nerdistocracy.

388
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,980
Well, it's about time.

389
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,040
It used to be whoever was biggest and strongest ran things.

390
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:16,960
Next it'll be whoever's weakest and most autistic will be the controllers.

391
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,600
Because they'll know how to run all the machines.

392
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,200
The nimblest fingers.

393
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,180
Of course, you remember Arkrum's great script, Cave Wimp, I think.

394
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,720
Yeah.

395
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,320
Well, I had the same theory before I even saw that.

396
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:38,000
That the first preacher was the first near-sighted cave man.

397
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,920
Or I suppose cave woman.

398
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,080
The one that couldn't see well enough to shoot rabbits.

399
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,700
And was clumsy at making spearheads and hand axes.

400
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,420
So the only way they could get by was by lying.

401
00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:00,740
And coming up with outrageous stories about how they were the one who had the magic inroad to the cave bear god.

402
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,160
Or whatever they were scared of back then.

403
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,940
That guy could really picket.

404
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,580
That's where religion came from.

405
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,360
Near-sighted cavemen who had no other way to survive except bullshit.

406
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, the cave wimp also sculpts these little sexy Venus and Willendorf.

407
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
Right, and manufacture pornography.

408
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,960
Yes, that the other tribes' men want.

409
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,720
Yeah, the first art was pornography.

410
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:37,620
And somehow he manages to sleep with all the women and pass his DNA along before the old hags and the big strong cavemen conspire to have him thrown into the tar pit.

411
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,660
Right, but he did sire lots of little nerd cavemen.

412
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,060
For the future, yes.

413
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,520
Yes.

414
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,600
Our grandfather, our ancient ancestor.

415
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,380
The old...

416
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,760
The man of the mountain.

417
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,540
The near-sighted caveman.

418
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,180
Yeah.

419
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,660
He was the first.

420
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,440
And his name was Smith.

421
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
He was a Smith.

422
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,520
Or Rodriguez, or maybe Lee, or Romano.

423
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,380
But it was one of those really common names.

424
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,620
He created objects which were then given value.

425
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,220
Yeah, objects that looked like big fat naked women.

426
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,940
Yeah, well, they were valuable.

427
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah.

428
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:30,120
Well, you know, on the long, long hunts, far away, going after the great beasts, late at night, you just get...

429
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,560
Tired of them.

430
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,520
You get tired of the other men after a while.

431
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,980
You start yearning for a big, fat, fertile-looking cavewoman.

432
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,900
And of course, fat was probably pretty hard to come by back then.

433
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,820
Highly prized.

434
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,440
So it was pretty special.

435
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,040
Mm-hmm.

436
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,400
Uh-huh.

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm with them.

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,560
I've got a little Venus of Willendorf replica.

439
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,300
You do?

440
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,420
Oh, well, yeah.

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,060
Yeah, a little replica.

442
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,380
In fact, it was made by the Church of All Worlds, one of our rival fake cults.

443
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,420
They manufactured those things.

444
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,800
Morning Glory Zell.

445
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,900
The late Morning Glory Zell used to make those Venus of Willendorf things.

446
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,740
She used to make them.

447
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,580
Interesting.

448
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, now, of course, it's a limited series.

449
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,920
I wonder if they're gonna have any lunch today.

450
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,420
I don't know.

451
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


452
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


453
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


454
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


455
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


456
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


457
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


458
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


459
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,420


460
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,540
Next time, we're gonna catch up with the

461
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,540


462
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,480
Okay, let's roll right in.

463
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,100
We almost did it.

464
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,420
Yeah.

465
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,600
All right.

466
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,500
Bob and Sex

467
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:24,200
Sex was the name of that mystery ditty there, which was by new contributor Reverend Forme, Reverend Neil B. Forme.

468
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:35,380
We also heard some Doctors for Wotan anti-music from around 1981, when the band was basically Philo, Hellswami, Satellite Weavers, and me.

469
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,340
Our titles and other collages are by Fernando Nande-Lemur tonight,

470
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,380
and all the rest of this hour of Slack.

471
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:55,360
Number 1,752 is live before an audience show from 22X Day, Day 2, Hour 2, July 3,

472
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:03,180
with Dr. Philo Drummond, Dr. Howell, and yours truly, the hungry Reverend Ivan Stang.

473
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
Hey, when is the pancake breakfast?

474
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
The pain cake breakfast?

475
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah, the pain cake breakfast and scrapple eating.

476
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,340
Mmm, that's a...

477
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,660
They're always scrapping.

478
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,440
Scrapple eating contest?

479
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,500
Bring any scrapple this year.

480
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,640
Pastor Pressure has scrapple.

481
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,220
What is scrapple?

482
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,220
Want to explain what scrapple is?

483
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,020
About pig guts and hair that won't even...

484
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,560
Stuff that's too gross to even put in hot dogs.

485
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,680
So it's like eyelids and foreskins.

486
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,940
It's a gristle.

487
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,760
And anuses.

488
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,120
And cornmeal.

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,100
Eyelids, foreskins, and anuses.

490
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,100
Stretch it out.

491
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,700
Of animals.

492
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,220
Of random roadkill.

493
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,620
Protein.

494
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,160
Pig.

495
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,640
Anuses.

496
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,200
Yes, it'll put on...

497
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
Chicken cloacas.

498
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,020
Strapping layers of muscle.

499
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,600
Pig urethra.

500
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,200
Pig urethra.

501
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,520
Build strong bones and teeth.

502
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,960
And all those urethra Franklin records.

503
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,640
Cowper's glands.

504
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,160
Other kinds of weird glands.

505
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
Bull testicles.

506
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,100
You don't even know things have these things in it, but they're in this stuff.

507
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,140
So that's the best kind of stuff.

508
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,820
The things that...

509
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,960
Throw in a couple spleens and a pituitary gland.

510
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,300
Gizzards.

511
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,740
There's some gizzards in there.

512
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,400
Gizzards that don't come from a bird.

513
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,560
Like vestigial human gizzards.

514
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,060
The gizzard is a good piece.

515
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,660
If cooked correctly.

516
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,620
I'm talking about vestigial human gizzards.

517
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,840
They're not even in a bird.

518
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,400
They're just...

519
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,120
You're now off eating human gizzards.

520
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,040
You may well enjoy that, but...

521
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,080
Anyway, don't trust fake scrapple from California.

522
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,660
The real scrapple all comes from Pennsylvania, isn't it?

523
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,400
And North...

524
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,440
Pennsylvania.

525
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,740
Well, nowhere.

526
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,320
That's right.

527
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,720
That's got butt holes in it.

528
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,080
Butt holes.

529
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,800
Scrapple.

530
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Homage to the homage.

531
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,820
Scrapple made out of butt holes.

532
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
Pig peckers.

533
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,520
Oh, no.

534
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,000
That's already in a higher cut of...

535
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,200
Right.

536
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,280
They use those in hot...

537
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,780
This is the stuff they won't use in hot dogs or pink slime or even Hormel canned chili.

538
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,500
Hot dogs.

539
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,760
That's an interesting concept.

540
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,220
They use like pig...

541
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,320
It's a huge, tasty hot dog.

542
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,160
The size of atomic submarine.

543
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,300
And they make scrapple out of that, huh?

544
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,560
Anyway, I love that stuff.

545
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,220
Yeah.

546
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,760
Why do we always have to eat oats and groats and anhedonic things?

547
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,720
Do you eat that stuff?

548
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
It tastes so bad, it makes you think you're a virgin.

549
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,380
Is anybody in here going to eat that?

550
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,540
Would anybody else eat any of that?

551
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,220
Eating what?

552
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,780
You would?

553
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,820
Eating what?

554
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Scrapple.

555
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,580
Oh, scrapple.

556
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,200
It's made out of pig nostrils and eyelids.

557
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,200
Made out of pig lips, but who cares?

558
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,660
My mouth is just watering.

559
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,020
Yeah, I know.

560
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,160
This culinary discussion is causing intense pangs of hunger.

561
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,760
Liver pudding.

562
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,860
Well, I say live and let live myself.

563
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,640
Are you hearing this thing?

564
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,460
No.

565
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:12,840


566
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,300
No.

567
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


568
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


569
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


570
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


571
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


572
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


573
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


574
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


575
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


576
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


577
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


578
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


579
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


580
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


581
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


582
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


583
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


584
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


585
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


586
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


587
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


588
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


589
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


590
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


591
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


592
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300


593
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,860
It's got liver in it.

594
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,460
It pops.

595
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,780
It splatters you in the face.

596
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,940
It pops like popcorn.

597
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,780
Liver pudding doesn't wish to give up its essence without a fight.

598
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:28,340
Scrapple lies there and is overrun by the Wehrmacht like France.

599
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,240
Man, that sounds very appetizing.

600
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,560
Well, it's that time of day when one wants to...

601
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,020
How do you eat it?

602
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, a nice hot piping pan of chicken gizzards or whatever.

603
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Goat clusters.

604
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,280
Boiled goat butter.

605
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,580
Boiled goat holes.

606
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,320
Now, you guys know that if Reverend Heathen hadn't been taken up onto the saucers prematurely,

607
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
we'd probably all be eating some scrapple right here at this table.

608
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,360
He'd be cooking chicken and not the healthy parts either, the good parts.

609
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,180
Who's going to feed us now that Reverend Heathen's gone and gone and gone?

610
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,360
I'd eat some kind of hide, you know, like animal hide.

611
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,320
Go into a monastic fast of ritual purification.

612
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,840
What about some carcass, generic carcass?

613
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,740
Some spoonfuls of...

614
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,920
Faintly tea-flavored water.

615
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,480
Slice.

616
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,720
Carcassoid.

617
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,280
Or we'll just see what...

618
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Where's the chuck wagon?

619
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,940
When's the chuck wagon going to be gone?

620
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
Where's the food truck?

621
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,800
Potter, Nostril, and Petal won't be here until Friday.

622
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,060
Taco, tamale, tostada, enchilada.

623
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,880
Friday.

624
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,240
Potter and Petal are the ones who also feed us.

625
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,260
Well, may they have a swift advent.

626
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,040
Yeah.

627
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't know what we'd do without them.

628
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,320
They're kind of like everybody's mom and dad now.

629
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,360
That's nice.

630
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:51,880
And the pressures.

631
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,040
You know, they know how to do things like put Band-Aids on people and how to call 911.

632
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,260
But nobody else can remember that long of a series of numbers.

633
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,720
People who know how to popcorn.

634
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah.

635
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,160
The magic, arcane secrets of cooking.

636
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,500
Yes.

637
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,640
To bring up...

638
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,280
Quebec.

639
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,180
Quebec.

640
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,880
Quebec.

641
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,100
They create a kind of a scramble called cretonne.

642
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,440
Uh-huh.

643
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,980
Cretonne.

644
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,780
Mr. Sister, why don't you get off your ass and just come up here and sit next to me and

645
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,480
you can heckle us in a way that the radio audience can hear.

646
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,140
Because I'm going to have to cut out these dead parts where you're doing your monologue.

647
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,140
Well, just say what he said, which was that there's a Canadian version of Scrapple called

648
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,300
Crack.

649
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,660
Cracot.

650
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,020
Cracot.

651
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,240
Cracot.

652
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,480


653
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,580
Cracot.

654
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,920
Scratch.

655
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000


656
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000


657
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,040
Like revenge.

658
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,240
Revenge.

659
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,460
Last year, we had somebody signing for the deaf.

660
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,380
Not that I understand that language either, but...

661
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,540
Well, that's it.

662
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,560
No one will be left out.

663
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,140
Yes.

664
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,640
Right.

665
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,220
You can do it.

666
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,120
Who can reach the deaf?

667
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,700
Who can speak for the dumb?

668
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,900
Wonderful.

669
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,880
Wonderful.

670
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, that's it.

671
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,640
I can do it. I can do it. See?

672
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,780
There you go.

673
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,740
Making your obscure hobo signals.

674
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,160
Hey, this means there's a lady in the house who'll give you lots of good stuff to eat.

675
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,520
Oops, I did it wrong.

676
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,720
This is the house of the psychotic ex-guy.

677
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,740
Oh, well.

678
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,980
Who likes to kidnap hobos and lock them up in the basement.

679
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:35,860
Right.

680
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,760
Do what he wants to with them, you know what I mean?

681
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,080
Right.

682
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,720
Muy hungrizi, Mo.

683
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
Muy hungrizi, Mo.

684
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,820
That sounds like something the president would say.

685
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,840
Or trying to prove.

686
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,480
Or any politician.

687
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,160
Muy hungrizi, Mo.

688
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,080
Trying to prove he's a friend to the president.

689
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,360
You have to rub your stomach and make a sad face.

690
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,880
And just say, yum, yum.

691
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,560
Eat them up.

692
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,500
First, you act like you're eating a sandwich that's not there.

693
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,340
Then you frown.

694
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,320
Then you rub your stomach and frown.

695
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,200
Rub your stomach.

696
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,280
You point to your open mouth with your finger.

697
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,260
It's like this.

698
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,880
Oh, just like that.

699
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,680
Just like what he's doing.

700
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,500
Sandwich grande.

701
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,360
That's how you do it.

702
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
That's how you get a meal.

703
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,020
How you make those sounds and that particular gesture.

704
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,000
Not everybody can do it, you know.

705
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,920
It's a skill which naturally comes to some.

706
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,820
And others have to learn after long study.

707
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,540
There's other languages you can choose, but few as plaintive and evocative as that one I chose.

708
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,380
Well, an army travels on its own.

709
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,100
Is pseudo-Spanish made up Spanish?

710
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,700
Si.

711
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,400
Si.

712
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Porto Griso.

713
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,060
Well, so this is all theoretical.

714
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,840
There aren't actually any buckets of Snapple over there.

715
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,320
There are.

716
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,160
Oh, there are.

717
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,520
There are buckets of Scrapple.

718
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,320
All right.

719
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,820
And bottles of Snapple.

720
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, boy.

721
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,580
And pipe loads of Gabrackle.

722
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,920
But that's just for the rich people.

723
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,920
Not everybody can get the Gabrackle.

724
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
We can look at them.

725
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,100
Yeah, you can look at it and sniff it when the other ones are smoking it.

726
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,300
You can look at it and sniff it.

727
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,320
You can get high on that stuff.

728
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,540
At least we took the special pills.

729
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,400
Well, anybody can have the pills.

730
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,800
The pills are still here.

731
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,220
You can come up and get those.

732
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,620
I ain't got bags of them.

733
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:22,940
Look at that.

734
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Bags of pills.

735
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,780
Soccer pills.

736
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,180
Yeah.

737
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,000
So we've done the menu, the X-Day menu.

738
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,760
How about the X-Day dress code?

739
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,720
All right.

740
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,160
We can discuss that, certainly.

741
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,920
Because when you're out there on that landing field, you want to look your absolute best.

742
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,280
You want to look your absolute best.

743
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,880
For the alien overlords when those ramps come down.

744
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:54,880
Looking at this audience, I would say that the main uniform seems to be a balding head and T-shirts.

745
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,040
T and sympathy.

746
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,140
Yeah.

747
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,520
With the X's.

748
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,280
Why do you think I wear this hat?

749
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,100
You have to cover your head if there's no air.

750
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,180
Otherwise, the blinding...

751
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,000
What's this balding?

752
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,260
The pain of sunburn on your bald head.

753
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,260


754
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,840
Never to be repeated, ever.

755
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,180
I look like I have hair.

756
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,020
It's the most maligned of all minority groups is the bald.

757
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,720
You're all a member or a potential member, soon to be a member.

758
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,000
Dr. Drummond, about 40 years ago, you said,

759
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,600
the subgeniuses are the most understood minority group.

760
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,040
You said that?

761
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,200
I still don't totally understand that.

762
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,760
I think you misunderstood what I said at the time.

763
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,340
No, you said...

764
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,120
I meant to say misunderstood.

765
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,140
I know.

766
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,840
You said the subgeniuses are the most understood, not the most misunderstood.

767
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,760
All the other minority groups are the misunderstood.

768
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,600
We're the really different minority group.

769
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
Yeah, we're the most understood.

770
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,840
What worried me about what that was, is it that simple?

771
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,320
I think they'd blow us off quicker than anybody else.

772
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,220
They're really stupid.

773
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,360
Maybe they're trying.

774
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,740
That just means they can blow us off sooner.

775
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,960
They're trying to understand.

776
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,300
I have an anecdote.

777
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,600
What?

778
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,500
And with a punchline by the late Reverend Ann Atrocity.

779
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,580
She was in the showers, the shower building, on one side or another.

780
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,860
I think it's still male and female.

781
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,200
Anyway, she overheard this conversation on the other side.

782
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,320
Oh, man, the subgeniuses.

783
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,660
It's these pagan guys.

784
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,980
They said that?

785
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,000
He said something along the lines to his friend.

786
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,860
Oh, they probably don't even know how to make a fire.

787
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,320
They don't know how to, you know, something like operate a blender or something like that.

788
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,820
And they hear from the other side,

789
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, we subgeniuses might know more than you think.

790
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,880
And then they shut up.

791
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,460
And I just loved that one.

792
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,520
I thought, what a wonderful person, Ann Atrocity.

793
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
That just...

794
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,040
Such a good comeback.

795
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,020
Oh, yeah.

796
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,160
Talking to these assholes, talking about what subgeniuses don't know.

797
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,100
Well, they know what you're saying, dumbass.

798
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,060
Not even know enough to make fire.

799
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,320
Oh, my God.

800
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,460
It is true that we depend on the pagans because they have the secret of fire.

801
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,300
Make them fire with fire sticks.

802
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,260
One day we're going...

803
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,020
We stole that secret.

804
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,380
One of us will learn how to make fire.

805
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,120
Well, yeah, with a lighter, that's sure.

806
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,500
I learned how to make fire.

807
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,080
I use a lighter or...

808
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,220
Boy Scout water.

809
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,080
The Boy Scouts taught me how to make a fire.

810
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,880
Do you make a fireball?

811
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,060
Have you ever known a Boy Scout who can't make a fire?

812
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,240
You rub two Boy Scouts together.

813
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,280
Every Boy Scout, upon attaining Eagle Scouthood,

814
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,540
earns his Boy Scout water badge.

815
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,640
Oh, they make a fire by rubbing water together real fast?

816
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
No, they carry special...

817
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,500
But you have to go so fast.

818
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,200
They get to carry the special Boy Scout water with them

819
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,840
so that no matter where they are,

820
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,240
they can use it.

821
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,700
They use the magic Boy Scout water to make a fire.

822
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,820
A squeeball.

823
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,240
Any place, any time, under any weather conditions,

824
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,880
the magic Boy Scout water will make a fire.

825
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
Well, so much for those pagans,

826
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,760
and clearly they didn't know their...

827
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,000
All we need is one Boy Scout.

828
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,240
Yeah, all you need is one R&X Boy Scout,

829
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,600
such as myself.

830
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,540
Oh, you're...

831
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,620
How far did you go before you were discharged on the parade?

832
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,040
I learned the secret of Boy Scout water.

833
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,220
I learned the secret of Boy Scout water.

834
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,220


835
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,220


836
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,220


837
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,500
I know the secret of Magic Boy Scout water.

838
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,740
I know the secret.

839
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,280
How far did you go in the organization?

840
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,100
Did you go through Wolf, Bear, Lion, Eagle?

841
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,380
Lion, Cub, Eagle.

842
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,700
All that stuff, Eagle.

843
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,860
Went up to Eagle, went up to Beagle.

844
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,200
And then they took you out to the parade field

845
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,520
and while the drums played...

846
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,200
They shot me.

847
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,160
They pulled off your insignia.

848
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,840
They took me out of my misery.

849
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,640
Right.

850
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,580
They murdered me like a cowardly scum.

851
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,160
Well, I won't...

852
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,300
I won't ask what your offense is,

853
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,980
but at any rate, you learned all their...

854
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,420
I learned all the secrets I need to learn.

855
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
Their lore, yeah.

856
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,080
Before I was so inappropriately dismissed.

857
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:24,980
Discharged.

858
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,500
So sad.

859
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,860
It's really a sad occasion.

860
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,040
Sent to Devil's Island.

861
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,840
Celebrated by sad, sad people.

862
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,020
They didn't even tell you about the higher ranks.

863
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,400
Spider, Protifer, Tardigrade.

864
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,120
No.

865
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,500
Yeah, see, only the...

866
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,940
That's like the Illuminati of the Boy Scout.

867
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,680
Right, right.

868
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,760
I just learned the lower...

869
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,760
More secret ranks.

870
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,820
The regular ranks.

871
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,180
Like how to make a fire under any weather conditions.

872
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,800
And when danger threatens, climb a tree.

873
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,540
So you have to have Boy Scout water with you.

874
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,600
Because if you have Boy Scout water, you can make a fire.

875
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,780
You just light the Boy Scout water and it goes...

876
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,120
Is that that same water you can run a car on?

877
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,940
Yeah, you can use it as a fuel.

878
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,860
Some people actually use it as a fuel.

879
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

880
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,220
Is that the kind they sell?

881
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,380
Those stations that are for some reason called gas stations?

882
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,760
I think so.

883
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,620
I believe that there is some similarity in the chemical composition of these.

884
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,240
Would you like to try one of my smart pills, Dr. Drummond?

885
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,680
That might teach you something.

886
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,020
Best kind pills, man.

887
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,240
More them kind pills.

888
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,760
No, those are different.

889
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,640
This is a smart one.

890
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,920
We grow too soon old and too late smart.

891
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,360
Yep, the Boy Scouts taught me something.

892
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,220
I've seen...

893
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,500
I've seen my brother hold his hand.

894
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,940
He knows when the pills are about to be dispensed.

895
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,580
He'll suddenly bend down and hold his hand under a goat's butt

896
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,360
and get a handful of little smart pills.

897
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,220
Of goat pellets.

898
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,800
If you eat one of these, it'll make you smarter.

899
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah.

900
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,660
And it's true.

901
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,260
You'll learn not to eat smart pills handed to you direct from a goat's butt by my brother.

902
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,040
My grandfather was growing those little chili patins,

903
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,400
those little hot peppers.

904
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,380
They're about that long.

905
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,260
They're red and yellow.

906
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,580
And he said,

907
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,340
That's a smart berry bush.

908
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,340
Those berries make you smarter.

909
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,360
And I bit one of those.

910
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:21,920
It was like...

911
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,020
Scotch bonnets or something.

912
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,380
He's like,

913
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,100
See, it made you smarter already.

914
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,180
It made you smarter.

915
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,360
You just don't go back to anything.

916
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,460
Don't trust grandpa.

917
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,420
Don't trust old men.

918
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Don't trust grandpa.

919
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,920
He meant it would make your tongue smart.

920
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,240
No, never trust grandpa.

921
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
Oh, foxy grandpa.

922
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm that kind of grandpa now.

923
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,540
He used to call my grandmother...

924
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,740
A million tricks.

925
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
The old hide.

926
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,020
What?

927
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,580
He'd say...

928
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,440
Oh, he did.

929
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,720
Where's the old hide?

930
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,880
Yeah.

931
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,080
You know, look around over those shoulders.

932
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
So he'd hide from her, eh?

933
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,920
And then if she was nearby...

934
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,200
No, like she was a cow hide hanging up on the side of the barn to dry.

935
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,960
A cow's outside.

936
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,380
Where's that old baggage that's your grandmother?

937
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,040
Yeah.

938
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,780
Where's your grandma, that old hide?

939
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Anybody seen the old hide?

940
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,040
That's what he'd say.

941
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,040
You seen the old hide?

942
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,720
Hmm.

943
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,560
I'd ask my dad.

944
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,740
He's like, dad, doesn't that seem weird that he calls her the old hide?

945
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,240
I just...

946
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,940
What did your dad say?

947
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,720
I don't remember what he said.

948
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,640
He'd say, no, son.

949
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,840
It's not weird at all.

950
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,120
No, it's just the way they love each other.

951
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,420
We're all hiding from her.

952
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,120
Not just your grandpa.

953
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,980
She was mostly deaf, so he had to scream really loud when she was in the room.

954
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,700
Super loud.

955
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,140
Super loud.

956
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,180
Even louder than...

957
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,740
Every conference day.

958
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,760
Well, you heard it here, folks.

959
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,100
I didn't hear anything.

960
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,040
What are you talking about?

961
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,620
What do you mean I can't hear?

962
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
I didn't hear what you said.

963
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,960
Can you say that a little louder?

964
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,500
I'm like David Lynch playing that detective in Fire Walk with me.

965
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,180
He has trouble hearing?

966
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,260
He was completely deaf.

967
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,880
He misunderstood everything anybody said to him, but then went with it.

968
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,120
But he could interpret the most absurd code.

969
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,420
What was that movie you told me to see?

970
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,740
The Room?

971
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,520
Bizarre Behavior Music has a secret message.

972
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,920
The Room.

973
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,820
Did you see that one?

974
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,400
The Room?

975
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,580
I never have.

976
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,340
I've been...

977
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,560
There was always some good movie I could see instead, so I...

978
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,620
You know, I have weird habits.

979
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,960
The way he described it, it sounded like Scarlet Love.

980
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,540
Oh, I know.

981
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:29,940
I know.

982
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,660
I'm dying to see it when I finish seeing all the good movies.

983
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,940
Yeah, it's hard to get through the list of good movies when there's one at the bottom of every list.

984
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,380
Oh.

985
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,640
I still watch bad movies now and then, but life is short.

986
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,980
Did you watch...

987
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,880
For most people.

988
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,960
Queen Crab?

989
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,120
No.

990
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,320
Never heard of Queen Crab.

991
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,280
I thought that was a good one.

992
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,840
Well, it's about this girl who...

993
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,720
Oh, no.

994
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,760
Here it goes again.

995
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,620
No!

996
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,380
She has a giant crab living on her property.

997
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,100
And at night it comes out of the lake and she rides it around.

998
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,940
But it...

999
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Queen Crab!

1000
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,700
So, is there any animal that hasn't been made into a really ridiculous monster movie?

1001
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
Pangolin, the motion picture.

1002
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,160
Okay.

1003
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,940
I don't know.

1004
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,280
Okay, well, kids, you got your walking orders, marching orders.

1005
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,700
Night of the Leapers.

1006
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:30,960
Pangolin!

1007
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,360
With an exclamation point.

1008
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,380
What are the most cute...

1009
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,220
The jaws of the Pangolin.

1010
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,400
What are the cutest animals that were made into horror animals?

1011
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,460
Well, Night of the Leapers.

1012
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,680
Yeah, that's the first one.

1013
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,940
What about Wombat?

1014
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,020
The motion picture.

1015
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,540
Yeah.

1016
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,400
They're kind of scary.

1017
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,340
If you look at the skeleton, they have these huge incisors.

1018
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,140
Teddy Bear 2.

1019
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,940
Well, there have been a number of Teddy Bear movies.

1020
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,680
Yeah.

1021
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Wombat has another peculiarity, which you probably don't want to discuss,

1022
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,580
but it is a curiosity in the animal kingdom.

1023
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,580
It's the only animal that eliminates little square feces.

1024
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,100
Perfect cubes.

1025
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,100
Cubic feces.

1026
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,960
It screeches.

1027
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,580
Which animal?

1028
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,560
The Wombat.

1029
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:11,900
Wombats.

1030
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,140
Oh.

1031
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,240
The Wombat.

1032
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,680
Yes.

1033
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,880
The shit little square cubic turds.

1034
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,320
Little, little squares.

1035
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,800
Little packages of turds.

1036
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,420
Hey, back off that mic a little bit, Dr. Drummond.

1037
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,700
Yes.

1038
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,200
Wombat scat is one of the wonders of nature.

1039
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,420
Little packages of turds.

1040
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,660
All packed up.

1041
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,000
It's just a hot range.

1042
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,560
It just...

1043
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,520
You can stack them.

1044
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,320
Get rid right there.

1045
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,820
Pile them up.

1046
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,120
Make houses if you want to.

1047
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,440
Just play dice.

1048
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Dr. Howell knows what I'm talking about.

1049
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,660
I'm talking about the common Wombat.

1050
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:48,380
And on the internet there are all these sites of women cuddling with Wombats.

1051
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,000
Really?

1052
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,640
Yes.

1053
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,420
Oh, wow.

1054
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,980
I need my internet now.

1055
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,960
There are many pictures of otherwise normal appearing women in a very intimate embrace

1056
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,120
with a Wombat.

1057
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,580
But there's never been a monster movie about when Wombats...

1058
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:11,640
When Wombats...

1059
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
That love goes wrong.

1060
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,700
Or when Wombats take the dark path.

1061
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,200
Of course, there was the prehistoric beast known as the diprotodon.

1062
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,120
Or that family that built a house out of Wombat turds.

1063
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,340
A rhinoceros-sized Wombat animal, which no longer exists.

1064
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,900
But what if a few of them do back in the outback?

1065
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,620
Those giant turd blocks that you could make into a house.

1066
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,780
They would leave behind...

1067
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,120
Yes.

1068
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,660
A concrete block-sized mementos of their passage.

1069
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,740
Build a giant turd house.

1070
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,460
Sea cucumber.

1071
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,180
Yeah, what about sea cucumbers?

1072
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,920
They're not very cute, but yeah, I haven't seen one.

1073
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,900
Sea cucumber, exclamation mark, the motion picture.

1074
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,120
Or...

1075
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,900
What about gerbil?

1076
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,940
Has there been a gerbil movie?

1077
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,780
The gerbil.

1078
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,100
They call him...

1079
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,640
The gerbil.

1080
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,640


1081
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,640


1082
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,640


1083
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,640


1084
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,040
Man-gerbil pig.

1085
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,260
May the light of this flickering candle

1086
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,100
Illuminate the night the way your spirit

1087
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,240
Illuminates my soul

1088
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,820
Can you hear me?

1089
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,640
Can you hear me?

1090
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,520
Can you see me?

1091
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,240
Papa, can you find me in the night?

1092
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,760
I'm alone.

1093
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,300


1094
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,780
What's this moody music that's...

1095
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,740
This is Basho.

1096
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,940
Or Basho.

1097
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,840
Robbie Basho.

1098
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,020
Man, this guy's really, really good.

1099
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,040
He's out there.

1100
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,340
Well, years ago in Arizona...

1101
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:08,480
He's so good.

1102
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,240
We used to get high and listen to it for hours.

1103
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,460
He's so good.

1104
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,060
Well, if he got high, he's got to be good then.

1105
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,120
Mm-hmm.

1106
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,580
I mean, that's proof.

1107
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,700
If a guy gets high, he's going to be good.

1108
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,640
No, he doesn't, but we do.

1109
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,360
We get high and listen to him when he's high.

1110
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,120
And we're supposed to say that's good.

1111
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,300
Yeah, I had to drive my truck all over Arizona,

1112
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,060
but fortunately I had this listening.

1113
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,640
Getting high with Robbie Basho.

1114
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,300
And...

1115
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,400
Of course, there have been movies made of all sorts of...

1116
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,980
of creatures.

1117
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,660
Frogs with Ray Milland actually was about a revolt

1118
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,400
of smaller animals across the spectrum of the animal kingdom.

1119
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,800
You'll be glad to know, Dr. Howell,

1120
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,960
that I've got the poster for that movie

1121
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,700
in my bathroom in Texas.

1122
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,520
Frogs.

1123
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,140
Yes, it's a picture of a frog

1124
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,880
with a human arm hanging out of its mouth.

1125
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,400
Never happens in the movie.

1126
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,580
It's not giant frogs.

1127
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,940
It's just a lot of angry frogs.

1128
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,960
And they're heading this way.

1129
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,280
Yeah.

1130
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,100
Toward Ray Milland and his decaying southern...

1131
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,300
Well, it could have been a midget.

1132
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,160
Or is it Raymond Burroughs?

1133
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,500
Like a really small midget that one of them ate.

1134
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,000
Did the frogs actually get bigger?

1135
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,780
Nope.

1136
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,060
Nope.

1137
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,700
They just get madder.

1138
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,240
Yeah.

1139
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,600
And they get even.

1140
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,400
So it'd have to be a tiny midget then.

1141
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Then there was Squirm, the worm movie.

1142
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,620
Adrian Barbeau is in frogs.

1143
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,920
Well, but she's not in Squirm, is she?

1144
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,360
Once this little black kid insisted on telling me

1145
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,840
the whole story of Squirm and acting it out.

1146
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:40,840


1147
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,080
Somebody tell me.

1148
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,080


1149
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,080


1150
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,080


1151
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,920
Is he telling you the whole story of a movie?

1152
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,820
Of a movie about worms.

1153
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,580
Tell us about it, Dr. Howie.

1154
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,160
The Squirm worms.

1155
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,680
Tell us about it in great detail.

1156
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,820
No, I...

1157
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,320
This was done for me.

1158
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,460
I'm not sure I could do it justice the way this kid did.

1159
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,300
Just give it a shot.

1160
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,940
No, I was in Berkeley sitting on my friend's porch

1161
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,560
and he dropped by and...

1162
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,900
Don't you do it.

1163
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,280
We don't need to talk about that movie in particular.

1164
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,560
There, of course, is the movie with the giant crawdad in it.

1165
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,220
Oh, Teenagers from Outer Space.

1166
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,880
Teenagers from Outer Space, yes.

1167
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,060
A crawdad.

1168
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,600
Aye!

1169
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,720
They have the skeleton ray.

1170
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,780
They point it at you and you crash to the ground as a skeleton.

1171
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,260
Yeah, but your skeleton is held together with little visible wires.

1172
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,140
And the neighbor's obnoxious dog comes barking.

1173
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,860
They point their ray and it crashes into a little dog skeleton on the ground.

1174
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,100
Did you guys have a rainstorm last night?

1175
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,720
Anybody?

1176
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,480
Was that a pretty good one?

1177
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:37,980
Yeah?

1178
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,040
Yeah?

1179
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,960
There's some good lightning.

1180
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,540
There's some good lightning and thunder there for a little bit, too.

1181
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,820
There's another monster movie.

1182
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,320
Rain!

1183
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,400
Oh, wait, that's been done.

1184
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
The Devil's Rain with William Shatner.

1185
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,560
There's a classic movie called Rain about a...

1186
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,060
Yeah, about a prostitute.

1187
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,300
A crazy preacher who gets carried away.

1188
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,780
In the tropics.

1189
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,580
Yeah, it's pretty atmospheric.

1190
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,380
And that steamy love scene.

1191
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,500
Steamy, real steamy.

1192
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,060
Lots of rain falling.

1193
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,780
People bathing in barrels.

1194
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,700
I don't remember that one.

1195
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,580
Rain?

1196
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,080
W. Somerset Morgham.

1197
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,160
It doesn't have any monsters in it or explosions, so you wouldn't know.

1198
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,280
Just rain that's constantly falling.

1199
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,500
And Sadie is the girl.

1200
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,740
Miss Sadie Thompson.

1201
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,960
You may have heard about her.

1202
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,760
Yes, she was known from Rangoon to Bombay.

1203
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,660
Starfish, the movie.

1204
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,840
Piranha, the Joe Dante movie, of course.

1205
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,780
And then...

1206
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,140
Sea Urchins.

1207
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,360
Chinchilla, the movie.

1208
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,280
There's some beaver-titled movie that's obviously...

1209
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,840
Zombievers.

1210
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,660
Zombievers, right.

1211
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,180
Yeah, Zombievers.

1212
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,760
That's on Netflix or Amazon or something now.

1213
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,200
I saw the poster and went, no.

1214
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,440
Skeeters, the one about the two-foot-long mosquitoes.

1215
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:10,200
Oh, the graphic for Zombievers shows a silhouette of a woman with her legs spread out and a beaver headed her way.

1216
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,200
So there'scop Deixaun's

1217
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,200
And the movie is...

1218
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,920
It quit.

1219
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:34,540
Just a silent attempt to get that out there.

1220
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,700
But, it is so goddamn short

1221
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,100
It's a case of's scanning either itself, or your brains.

1222
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,300
Still a f

1223
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,900
Oh復

1224
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,940
Give me a minute.

1225
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,000
Give me a minute.

1226
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,000


1227
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,020
shows that everybody says you have to see that's why you need like five screens at once and just

1228
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,460
multitask with your eyeballs well queen crab wasn't so bad actually oh see there's another

1229
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:57,160
one i have to see queen crab well it's not easy to see if you've never seen game of thrones if

1230
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,680
you could just do two screens at one time you could double your viewing that was like the man

1231
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:09,920
who fell to earth who watched six tvs at the same time that's mr sister he does that i could do two

1232
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,280
at the same time actually a lot of that he had he had five tvs going and a couple of radios

1233
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,200
all the time i hated going over there i don't have anything on most of the time because i'm

1234
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:31,820
i need to hear my own who was this clearly also i have an mp3 player in my head that's

1235
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,400
loaded with really good old cuts you had that stuff going who was that

1236
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,700
what huh who was

1237
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:39,900
what

1238
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:39,900


1239
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:57,460
the puzzling evidence show or any given subgenius show with more than two microphones oh that

1240
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,760
yeah i thought you were talking about someone who you went over to their house and they had

1241
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,880
yeah they had all these monitors on tvs with the monster movies and the news and the mexican buddha

1242
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,720
he called yeah he well he thought that uh everything was all connected to the magic mushroom

1243
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,660
yeah tables are based on mushrooms yeah oh well there's always mushroom freaks yeah

1244
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,220
yeah no and this is not just mushrooms is the peyote button

1245
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:36,180
mushroom expert apparently the peyote button exhibits you know geometric patterns and its

1246
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,240
design

1247
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,620
and uh

1248
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,040
so because of that geometry there was all this magic involved and

1249
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,260
he could talk about it for hours i think it's all a bunch of hooey

1250
00:49:51,640 --> 00:50:00,160
myself he also felt that almost every logo was secretly an obvious masonic symbol

1251
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:09,860
mcdonald's it's a big m duh masonic anything that was a square that i said well that's just a square

1252
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:16,260
like a building because that's a pyramid scene from below man and any circular

1253
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,960
logo that's the eye in the pyramid see the masons are everywhere i brought pretty soon

1254
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,780
that same guy had he just about hit me because well i think they really did go to the moon

1255
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,500
nick neil armstrong yeah i think that yeah that happened

1256
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,200
john neal armstrong

1257
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,780
he was about to kill me for believing that and then

1258
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:45,200
And about a month later, he was insisting that not only had the government, the U.S. government, gone to the moon,

1259
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:54,340
but we had slave camps there inhabiting the ancient crystal cities that you could see in the bad photo artifacts.

1260
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,300
So the Nazis aren't doing it.

1261
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,320
It's us who's doing it.

1262
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,020
Yeah.

1263
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,440
Yeah.

1264
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,560
Well, the conspiracy, you know.

1265
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,500
On the strange world of the moon.

1266
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:03,940
Yeah.

1267
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:11,980
The shadow government, the dark government, the secret government, you know, the Rockefellers, the Bilderbergers.

1268
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:12,900
The Bilderbergers.

1269
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,480
The Bushes.

1270
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,560
The Bilderbergers.

1271
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,780
You know, the Clintons, you know, the Trumps, the conspiracy, the monsters, the aliens, the lizard people.

1272
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,020
The reptoids.

1273
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,580
The mummies.

1274
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,560
The Assyrians.

1275
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,320
The mummies.

1276
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,780
Yeah, right.

1277
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,880
The Unarians.

1278
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,380
The Chinese and the Israelis are heading for the moon.

1279
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,460
Yeah, the Jews.

1280
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,740
I left out the Jews, of course.

1281
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,840
That's why we're going.

1282
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
The alien monsters.

1283
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,240
The Easter masons.

1284
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,620
We've been goosed into action because of the Chinese and Israelis making their moves on the moon.

1285
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:49,160
So in the next ten years, the U.S. is going back in a big way to keep those others from establishing hegemon.

1286
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm king of at least six people, most of them security guards.

1287
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,760
I'm farting from upstate New York to Maine.

1288
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,100
And the mayor of Boston staggers home.

1289
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,700
Heavy wet farts.

1290
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,840
That's been a benefit.

1291
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,660
Farts today.

1292
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,360
On Wall Street at this hour, 152.

1293
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,700
The White House says that this is PR News from Washington.

1294
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:29,320
The popular social networking internet website PR News has reached agreement with more than 45 sexual predators to protect $20 billion worth of weapons.

1295
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,720
An Israeli official is supposed to fly within 125 miles of PR.

1296
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:33,920
PR News.

1297
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,680
PR News in Washington.

1298
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,080
PR comes from low-income women and children and families.org.

1299
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,580
How do you find a conspiracy?

1300
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,540
Well, the conspiracy is not chosen.

1301
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,580
The conspiracy chooses us.

1302
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:00,540
It finds the most receptive place for us to insert our sensory tentacles into.

1303
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,880
And we are automatically shunted.

1304
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,740
We are automatically shunted to that place.

1305
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,460
So the trick is not finding it, but avoiding it.

1306
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:19,880
Or the trick is marrying it and getting from it what one can get while nonetheless preserving some hidden place of autonomy from it.

1307
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,180
Oh, you mean like me and Starwood?

1308
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,320
Yes, kind of like that.

1309
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,740
That would be a good example.

1310
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,600
I married that conspiracy.

1311
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,780
I didn't know that was what was happening.

1312
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,380
Well, Bob married Connie, after all.

1313
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,820
You see, you can't...

1314
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,040
avoid the conspiracy.

1315
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,700
But you can even be intimate with it.

1316
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,620
But it can be productive and valuable to you

1317
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,720
as long as you surf the luck plane of slack.

1318
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,660
Oh, finally some subgenius talk.

1319
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,260
Yes.

1320
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,300
Of course, only Bob doesn't fall off the board.

1321
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,960
You will wipe out frequently.

1322
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,640
But the important thing is to continue following the example of Bob

1323
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,200
and surf the luck plane of slack.

1324
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,760
And all bumps, bruises, and contusions are not...

1325
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,520
my responsibility nor those of the Church of the Subgenius.

1326
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,840
They are nobly acquired battle scars on your subgenial path.

1327
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,080
Subgenius Dogma

1328
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,080


1329
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,400
Hmm?

1330
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:16,940
Hmm?

1331
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,460
Hmm?

1332
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,280
Oh, what?

1333
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:18,900
What?

1334
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,060
Huh?

1335
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,260
Huh?

1336
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,880
Yes, it's true.

1337
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,520
You've got to surf the luck plane.

1338
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,120
Oh, when the subject turns to subgenius dogma, I fell completely asleep.

1339
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,100
Let's get back to the obscure monster movies.

1340
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,700
That sounds completely true.

1341
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,380
Uh-huh.

1342
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,580
I'm sorry I put you down for the obscure monster movies.

1343
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:33,740
Uh-huh. Well, you see...

1344
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,720
Uh, uh, obsession, Dr. Howell.

1345
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,760
Well, the thing...

1346
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,980
That's actually better than the sub...

1347
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,080
The thing about Queen Crab is that the girl who's in it,

1348
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,880
her parents were mad scientists who passed away,

1349
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,860
but not before she'd acquired a dinner plate-sized pet crab

1350
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,660
that comes up and rubs affectionately against her.

1351
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,120
Well, sir, after about six years, this crab is the size of a small house.

1352
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,960
It lives in the bottom of the lagoon, yonder.

1353
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,980
It comes out every now and then

1354
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:10,580
to chop people in half who don't have respect for the ecology and like that.

1355
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,540
And also, it spawns a huge bunch of dinner-table-type crabs

1356
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,700
which are running around on the freeway being run over by rowdy rednecks

1357
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,780
in their big, tired vehicles.

1358
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,400
It's quite a movie, I've got to tell you.

1359
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,300
And in the night, the girl gets out and dances

1360
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,060
and then she rides her giant crab through the gloom.

1361
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,640
With special effects, stop-motion animation done by Brett Piper,

1362
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,300
responsible also for a nymphoid barbarian in Dinosaur Hell

1363
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,160
and Arachnia, if you've seen that one.

1364
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,980
He's got a number of them.

1365
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,780
He's tirelessly making movies which are then stolen by producers

1366
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,240
and he never makes any money.

1367
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,680
So he goes on to make the next one.

1368
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:06,180
It sounds like a Mighty Joe Young kind of rip-off.

1369
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,080
No, with a crab, yes, a crab.

1370
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,140
Mighty Joe Wombat.

1371
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,920
And the crab, there's this bad sheriff's deputy.

1372
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,580
He's a bad character all around.

1373
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,700
And after the crab pitches him in half,

1374
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,640
the crab grabs the car and kind of impatiently, angrily shakes it.

1375
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,660
There's a lot of character animation there.

1376
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,680
Picks up the sheriff's pickup and slams it to the ground

1377
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,900
in sort of crab-like petulance.

1378
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,600
Very well portrayed.

1379
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,900
Philo's got a sound effects thing that sounds like kids hitting cardboard boxes.

1380
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,820
It sounds like it, yes.

1381
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,100
Kids love to hit cardboard boxes, God bless them.

1382
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,320
Yep, if you get out boxes and put them on your floor and kids come over,

1383
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,180
they will be quite happy fooling around with those boxes.

1384
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:09,220
I have delighted my grandsons by saving up the giant boxes

1385
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,800
that my puffy envelopes come in

1386
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,920
so that they can build towns out of them and tear them up

1387
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,460
or build robot suits and then tear up towns.

1388
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,020
It's the only thing that will get those kids off of their pads,

1389
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,700
their iPads and YouTube.

1390
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,880
Empty boxes.

1391
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,600
Something they can tear up.

1392
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,460
This is little boys, girls are probably different.

1393
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,180
A necessary life stage for these.

1394
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,440
Dr. Drummond, what are you doing?

1395
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,100
Box dwelling Barbies and Kins.

1396
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,680
Little boxes on the hillside.

1397
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,180
He looks so innocent over there.

1398
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,980
Yeah, he's shooting it in.

1399
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,580
He reminds me of my dog Buddy when it's time for a walk.

1400
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,760
He wants to get my attention.

1401
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:58,840
Squawk.

1402
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,940
Well, we were talking about gristle and Snapple and Scrapple

1403
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,880
and all the things which we might be eating.

1404
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,940
Yes, the hour of crap is coming to the end of its second hour.

1405
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,840
Hour of scrap, I mean Scrapple.

1406
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,380
The hour of digestive issues slowly assimilated and pondered over.

1407
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,680
So we'll wipe.

1408
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,780
Wipe the slate clean.

1409
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,020
The alimentation.

1410
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,540
You see, man is a food tube like all extant organisms.

1411
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,800
One travels essentially through the food as the food travels through one.

1412
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,660
A commensal relationship.

1413
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,460
And at times one is food and at other times one consumes the food.

1414
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,220
As we navigate our environment.

1415
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,340
Food is all.

1416
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,040
It's like the environment itself is like

1417
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,240
the stomach of a giant creature.

1418
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,280
Yes, rugated, pulsing and suffused with blood.

1419
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,840
You see, food is organic in nature.

1420
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,020
But everything else is inorganic.

1421
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,760
There is no dirt, nothing unclean without food.

1422
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,000
But there is no life without food either.

1423
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,940
Otherwise you have utterly clean crystal mineral formations.

1424
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,000
Rock with no bacteria, no water, no air.

1425
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,920
Just mineral perfection.

1426
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,020
And friends, that's what the world would be like without Slack and Bob and the Church

1427
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,000
of the Subgenius.

1428
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:42,460
For more information on this show, Bob Dobbs and five other Subgenius shows and how to

1429
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:47,940
become a member and a minister, you can see subgenius.com.

1430
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,620
And remember kids to always eat your Scrapple.

1431
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,920
Price Bob.

1432
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,920
However, off the public supported Airways

1433
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:14,500
I can tell you to send thirty five dollars or you will die on X day or something much,

1434
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,180
much worse.

1435
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,300
And if you already have become a subgenius minister and gotten that huge twenty five

1436
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,980
piece membership kit with button and bumper stickers and ministers card and membership

1437
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:24,980


1438
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,780
many frameable certificates and lots of dog's heads,

1439
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,160
you might not have the book of the subgenius or Neighborworld

1440
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,680
or even our world-famous pamphlets.

1441
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,020
Over 100,000 sold!

1442
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,780
Well, not Neighborworld, about 80 of those, right?

1443
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,260
But come on, man!

1444
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,840
A thing?

1445
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,100
For that matter, there's fast clothing designs and drinkware

1446
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,940
with subgenius graphics on them

1447
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,520
and all manner of fine dobsware and dobs gimmickry.

1448
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,560
We have Bob Daggetts and DVDs of movies, good and bad ones,

1449
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,080
mostly pretty good and very weird,

1450
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,320
and CDs of what we did before the radio shows and after,

1451
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,540
like stage shows and such.

1452
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,620
Boy, it's just an immense mess of keen and yet sacred collectibles,

1453
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,520
enjoyables and guilty pleasures.

1454
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,220
And the book of the subgenius is autographed when you get it from us.

1455
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,220
Not by Bob, no, sorry, just me.

1456
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,000
Anyway, thank you, friends, and good night or good day or whatevs.

1457
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,200
Praise Bob.
