Spindle your boss and give him the toss.
Ample-chapped apple samples for cramped grandma hampers.
And look, set fire to it, it consumes itself.
Come on, how does it work?
The invisible visualizer balances the biometric forces behind most divorces,
yins the yang chain between the brain and the anus,
and double bonus, removes the onus betwixt animation and animus.
Plus, double fucked on the bus or in the crux between waxed biscuits or extra crust,
it does the thinking for you.
Now how much would you pay?
But wait, there's more.
For a limited time only, if everybody on the planet gets their own individual invisible visualizer,
then peace and tranquility is guaranteed to rule for thousands, possibly even millions of years.
But until then, why not get your own and completely rule in every conceivable way
over your foolish friends and neighbors who will choose to bet a get one themselves
through this once in a lifetime TV offer, get yours today while supplies last.
The invisible visualizer is not recommended for actual use or misuse under any circumstances.
Thank you.
The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on earth.
But I think that's a luxury, not a curse.
To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom.
Good time to take inventory.
Now let me tell you though...
Music


I wish I was an animal.
NI
We're gonna give it to you like
Brothers and sisters
We must confront ourselves
We know that all men and women are created good
We must understand why you have gone bad
You cannot play checkers with your life
Jumping around like an old whirlwind
Wrapping your dishes and plates
And then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnome
A pink boy
A lily
A twig
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you
But we know inherently that we are all created good
By Jehovah One
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life
You couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie
This is when you should look to Bob
When you look to Jehovah One and say
Bob, come into my life
And you should see one set of footprints in the sand
And that is when you will know
That Bob has charged you five dollars and not nine cents
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you five dollars and not nine cents

To carry you to the nearest taxi
Praise Bob and his divine ways
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin
A baby inside of a twin
Inside of a woman's belly
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be
You gotta raise up above this wiggly world
And grab the hand of Bob
Praise him and all that flows from Bob
And the future has found Bob
Light your bright lights up and test me back
Well, welcome to the hour of slack
Praise Bob, Bob and Connie's rack
Yeah!
Welcome to the hour of slack
So friends, I want you to pray
I want you to pray to yourself
For slack
Don't be coming up to me or Jesus or somebody after the X Day Festival
After you've been ruptured going, well, hell
I gave you my thirty dollars, now where's my slack?
My friend, as long as you think slack
Is something that can be sold to you by anybody at all
You belong to the conspiracy
Because as long as slack can be bottled and sold
The conspiracy is ahead
But as long as it can't be bottled and sold
As long as they don't really know what it is
That they're trying to steal away from your friends
As long as that's true, then Bob Dobbs can't lose
And you know Bob can't lose
Because he's the luckiest, luckiest goddamn saver in the world
He may not be the smartest, sure
This may be a fucked up church of the subgenius
But Bob Dobbs, he's the luckiest
He's the luckiest
And it doesn't matter if we're neurotic and broke and poor and fucked up
We're still better than them
Why?
Only because of Bob
And because we're subgeniuses
We don't need any other excuse, none
No other explanation
That's what this religion is all about, friends
You don't need no Jesus
And you don't even need Bob
In fact, you don't need any pipe-smoking salesman or any aliens
You can't depend on him, man
We learned from the X-Day drills
Building up to this time
That while it's a good idea to buy your membership
You better also start building your own ship, my friends
Build your own ship or steal one
But in the meantime, we're all stuck together on this one
Rather large, rickety spaceship as it is already
And we're all stuck together on this one
We better try as best we can
Not to fuck it up for good
Because that's what the conspiracy will do
Trying to make a buck
You know it, I know it
But only we individually know what the hell we're gonna do about it
One thing you can't do
Is worry about it all the goddamn time
And that's why slack is so important
All we're doing here is giving you a pep talk, friends
Just trying to remind you
That what it comes down to
Is actually three simple things
Bob, slack, and the conspiracy
There really is a conspiracy
There really is slack
And there must be a Bob, friends
Or we would not be here preaching about what we have
So friends, there is hope
That's all we're trying to tell you
I sure am glad that I didn't kill myself that one time
I've had some rough times just like anybody else
And you know Bob said to follow the path of least resistance
But killing yourself is getting off the path entirely
So friends, if you were ever considering
Sure, of course, this is a totally fucked world
And you're lucky if you can get a few moments of pure slack
But the fact that you can get those clips
Proves that it's there for you
And just keep going for it, friends
Because just when
You know, Bob has a funny way of dealing with
Happiness and slack and stuff
You can work your ass off
Trying to get what your idea of happiness was
Do you think your idea of happiness
Is any better than Bob's idea of happiness for you?
So friends, you just
Every now and then he might fuck up your plans for happiness
But that might be what we call involuntary slack
Sometimes he forces you to stop at what you were doing
And at first it seems like a disaster
And then you realize later
It's the best thing that ever happened
That accident made you stop
And what the fuck you were doing
And made you realize what you really wanted to do
And the only way you can do that
Is to start doing it
Bob teaches magic
Yeah, we believe in magic
The first key of Bob's magic is this
I'm gonna give it to you free
Get off your ass
If you don't like what's going on
Move, baby, move
Inflate, rise
Get out of it
When you repent, quit your job and slack off
The worst thing that happens
Is you might get a better paying job
You just remember that, friends
And the next time the conspiracy
Tries to make you feel like you're some kind of a fuck-up
Just remember
Yeah, you may be
But you're not half as fucked up as they are
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow

Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow

Even though you are a worthless, greedy lot.
How annoying that sound.
Fools. What fascinations there are on this planet.
Strange mortals with curious customs.
We'll have a storm now, and an earthquake if you like.
You must stand aside.

Never mind them.

We could make more sometimes.
If we need them.

You have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy!

It's what you learned earlier.
Think about it,
what I lose
is now.
tender grip, its mercies,
its gentle cradle, until
we've approached the moment
of wisdom, at which time
it turns its hand down
and its cold, icy stare
out of it. And so we know
that Godzilla will be back
again
to teach man a lesson.
Only this time
he will
come to man
in the form of a friendly little
puppy named Joy Boy.
We have already seen
these things. Dr. Panaram
and Dr. Patel and I have
spent hours and hours in mystic
dreaming, and this is our prediction
that not only will
the white buffalo return,
but the cute little puppy will be
the messiah of mankind.
Oh man, that's a
lousy prediction.
Thoughts that were on a level,
and a kind of thoughts that seem,
that they interpret as paranoid
and I think it's like a, just
anyone who, it's like
it's like
1984 or something.
It's like anyone who really
thinks against the, who thinks
in a different, they've got it set up
so that they interpret
anyone who tries to put together
a creative understanding of
the way things work in a way
that they, that there's too much
controlling, like too much
like, too much with free will,
too much like, they've got to
admit that you're just completely,
in a certain way and that's it.
You've got to admit, you can't really change
things, you've got to admit you can't really
do that much, you can't really,
things aren't that weird, things aren't weird,
things are, you know,
it's all set,
it's like 1984,
if you think too differently
they're going to label you schizophrenic
because they're scared of you.
They don't even know they're scared of you,
they just think, ooh,
you're, you know,
they think you're just,
crazy, you know, it's the,
it's all the system is all set up to,
to just suppress people.
It's just, my identity is screwed,
I have no identity.
It's just, my identity is like
at the basis of all universes,
it's at the, it's at the,
the big bang.
My identity is just, is atomized
and I'm down choosing between
the left and the right,
at the very source of everything.
So,
so I'm completely shattered.
So I can, you know, whatever I see,
I feel like I am,
or I'm the opposite of.
I'm just like an atomized creature.
I'm just horribly,
just in effect,
in, just sort of nothing,
nobody,
more than I ever was before,
nobody.
Because I,
it's just, it's just not,
I was, I was connected to my inner motivations,
I knew what basically they were,
I knew, I knew what this is, that and that's this, so,
of course I'll follow this,
but if now I think,
this is not this,
this is the opposite of this,
or this is the opposite of that,
everything becomes totally like atomized,
like I don't know what is what,
I don't know what I am.

everything is just,
it's, it's,
because I'm right at the source of everything,
so everything, it's right, you know,
you choose at the beginning,
left, right,
at the very beginning of everything,
and that's where I am,
right at the source of everything.
There was a point,
where I, I was,
I was paranoid,
and I was kind of,
you know, making sure,
I was kind of keeping things at a distance,
a certain way,
I was paranoid,
and I was,
I was, you know,
up to that point,
you know, I was trying to figure out things,
kind of rationally,
and then at some point,
at that point,
I kind of put everything together,
and I said,
oh, it's all,
I get it,
it's like,
it's,
you know, it's like the,
everything is,
it's the fault,
these fears are false,
they're,
they're things put in,
they're not true,
you know,
I can just let it go,
naturally,
and not worry,
and not get paranoid,
just,
just get into things,
then everything is fine,
and it was,
then it,
because it just started flowing,
and there was energy,
it just,
energy,
energy was just coming out of me,
I was just,
I had super power in me,
and it came in,
and it went out,
and I,
And you control the guys
on the radio station,
you control their minds,
right?
I do,
I,
I projected this,
this,
this philosophy,
this understanding of existence,
this basic understanding,
and they picked up on it,
and I was like,

because I just,
because the things they were saying,
it was just like,
oh,
that's what I was thinking,
so I,
and they were like,
they're acting like,
oh,
they just got revelations,
and it was from me,
I knew it was from me,
Those exact same thoughts you had,
right?
Yes,
yes.
Oh,
yes,
dear friends,
and as you may have figured out by now,
this particular hour of Slack,
number 1,356,
was not assembled by yours truly,
Reverend Stang.
In fact,
it's a bit of a mystery,


a subgenius by the name of Reverend Bucky Argyle assembled all of this from very old subgenius stuff,
and brand new things that I've never heard before,
a lot of it pulled from YouTube.
Reverend Bucky Argyle,
who I think I only know from the Euro subgenius Yahoo list,
one of many Church of the Subgenius forums,
anyway,
the thing we just heard was somebody called Mike Wood,
with noise added by Bucky Argyle from some video.
He gave me a list of what was on it,
but it's kind of incomplete.
Before that,
we heard yours truly ranting,
I think it's X Day 99 with Einstein Secret Orchestra,
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar there,
chess,
and keyboard.
The music in the background right now is by Lectro Girl called No Rap,
No Rock.
We heard Kings of Feedback,
Reverend Bill T.
Miller doing the song Kill Bob.
There was a clip from the film by Will Vinton,
Mysterious Stranger,
which is really by Mark Twain.
Will Vinton did a claymation Mark Twain movie long ago.
Before that,
something called GPS Math Girl from Noise.
The song Teen Devil Worshipper was by Idiot Flesh.
We heard some Vedic chanting from Ravi Shankar.
Me ranting again with Einstein Secret Orchestra.
Message to Anonymous Subgenius.
I can't remember the name of the guy who does that rant.
Before that,
something from YouTube.
Not sure what it was.
The Incredible Invisible Visualizer was by Bill Cates and Reverend Alex Orichio.
I should say Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,
not Bill Cates.
Anyway,
I'll let this music continue and I'll give some more credits at the end of the show.
Praise Bob.
We'll listen here to Lectro Girl.
No rap, no rock.
Yeah.
Crank it up.
Haha thegenson is gonna beat us to a pulp.


Feelin' gave it another name going on.

I had very little wrong with it.
But now that spirit has found an avenue of unbelief.
And he'll keep working at that and working at that until he gets you to kill yourself.
Yeah, yeah.
But now, the difference here is divine healing comes from the word through your spirit into your body.
Yes.
And that's primary.
But the body also has to be taken care of.
The mind, mental food that is divine, renews the mind.
Comes from the spirit of God in the form of revelation.
From the word of God by faith, which comes into your spirit and into your mind to renew it.
Yes.
But if you don't take the time to feed your mind on the word of God,
the revelation.
You can never get up there and do it.
It's too bad.
You are like flies fighting.
Magazines and TV programs and motion pictures.
Trash.
Let's look at the word.
So, Jesus.
It does not simply mean just below a genius.
Sub G intelligence level can range far, far below genius.
The sub genius does not pretend to super knowledge, but to self knowledge.
Knowledge of the under things.
The hollow earth from whose darkness issue the Nazi hell creatures and other demons of the abyss.
It is in contemplation of the under things.
The underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence that the sub G.
It is in contemplation of the under things. The underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence that the sub G.
It is in contemplation of the under things that the sub G there, so it can't even be recognized as hacia it is just había's

Was it a matter of restarting, or you?
infinite supply of it, but the conspiracy has most of it now. They don't even know what it is,
but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away. How do you think you ended up a slave to
their so-called work? True slack is by definition indefinable. It is a kind of direct perception,
unbettered by common sense. It is not mere laziness. It is rather a kind of active sloth.
And slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison. Next to slack,
the nirvana known to mystics and saints is like endless torment. Slack is different from
controversy. One might call it something for nothing. But the normals, the mediocratons,
the somnambulax, and pseudo-subslans have tried to make it something which we have been led to
believe we must work to buy. It is this yearning for slack that separates us from the normals.
The
Shackles

A human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,
his hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure,
yet he never feels cheated. He thinks it is natural. Perhaps we should pity them, but face it,
most people are evil jerks, half-witted cattle, racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse
and stampeding you along with them. Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrits?

Blacklessness may soon come to an end.
Oh, it won't happen without a bitter struggle.
But at least there is hope.
We have seen the coming of a savior, a beacon of slack,
a banner behind which we may all unite.
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs
and his mighty Church of the Salt Genius.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dragging your butt through the day,
selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex?
There is a simple answer, dear friend.
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master
and his Church of the Salt Genius.
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal,
for Bob comes to justify our sins,
to unmask the conspiracy and to get us back.
The slack they stole away.
It's us versus them.
Are you going to fry in hell on earth
alongside the pink boys?
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes
and accept Bob into your mind?
Repent, quit your job, slack off, and praise Bob!
The Church of the Salt Genius,
eternal salvation, or triple your money back.
Okay, when a sperm and egg go together to make a baby,
only one sperm goes up in the egg.
And when they touch, there's two contact points
that touch before the other two.
And then it's carried up into the egg.
And when they fuse, it's like nuclear fusion,
except it's human fusion.
There's a mass loss of the proton.
One heat abstraction goes up in the electron,
spins around, comes back down into the proton
to form the mind, and the mind can be reduced to one atom.
Or you take the brew on the side on the time,
and you take the bottle right,
and you take the bottle right,
and if you take the drink,
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,
and you're all able to bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee,
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee-
bam-a-loo-da-bam-a-loo-da-bee-
Oh, genius.
Powerful.
Oh, dear, gods unhigh.
Though you push me down a thousand times,
I'll climb back up,
until I'm more than a man,
until I stand among you,
your equal.
Like in the daytime, when I'd be outside in the sun,
I used to show my friends things that they hadn't seen
before like the halo see like halo when i was 19 when i was a preacher i had my trial ceremony i
seen a little light on my shadow on the ground in the daytime and then now from ever since then
it's like the light coming further down on my body around my shadow and hold my body around
my shadow and i see the light which is your halo i mean your aura and that's why everybody can't
see that well if you if you see you got something to do the drugs too we say and now i don't know
what for real i know what i see but i don't know for real or not and so that's why that's why you
see people different and say like that anointing like see like sometimes when i come outside
um i can see uh when i look at the tree the wind started blowing but we know we got oxygen from
the plants and we get them carbon dioxide and so it's the wind usually blow sometimes but
they don't blow all the time like when i'm in the house a long time it broke real strong
let have slack
Very well, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What does this mean?
Thank you.
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that Church of the Subgenius is.
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy.
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those citizens.
The Subgeniuses, we're going to get them right in the gonads.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
I don't use words like that.
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll,
is proof positive that this so-called church is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.
All those demented Beelzebub kissing hop heads make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse cookies
with their talk of buckets of pills.
From that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Where they're so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity in their tapes.
Too many children listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the Subgenius Foundation.
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack.
Like that heathenist idea of nirvana.
I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting
and pulled until it sees the end.

In the light of a normal day like the rest of us do.
So what should any decent-minded American do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob?
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol.
They usually stink to high heaven.
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer.
Well, they'll get bombarded with enough People magazines,
arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis Philbin fan club material
so they won't be able to think anymore.
No way.
It should be.
Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glories of the home shopping club,
Wingo, Zingo, and the evils of Mandingo.
We cannot stand by while our standards and principles are made light of by these possessed fools.
Normals of the world unite.

It makes me feel like I'm alive.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.
The oceans below me
Expanding like a fuse.
My vision holds purest land.
And brings me land to lose.
Away.
A fire party.
Soon there'll be my end.
I'll get through my vibrations.
With the music of my spirit.
I don't need these wings to guide me.
They are partly covered there.
It's the clear I need first.
It makes me feel like I'm alive.
I've got an invitation.
I've got an invitation.



I've got a little taste of you
Would you tell me a bedtime story?
Can you tell me what the 60s were like?
Was it really like an Oliver Stone movie?
I don't think it was a good movie.
I think it was a good movie.
I think it was a good movie.
Coming up, rerun of Laugh-In.
Hey, remember body painting?
You keep awful records in your basement real loud.
A cheap high five.
Yeah, yeah, and painting it black
and putting those black light posters up like,
like, look at this one.
When the light hits it,
you can practically see it.
They're twitching there.
Dang.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wow, man.
Vaughn Meter dead ahead.
Boy, that brought those colors out, man.
Everybody on the floor, let's dance.
It's the 60s.
It's the electric baboons, man.
60s slang, they really swung.
I'll show you how to handle a hornet.
It's a pig, man.
When the pigs bust through my door,
then the people are gonna have to bring
the power to the peephole
and peep on those pigs out through the poop hole.
Oh, wait.
This is the sensitive part of the 60s.
You know, when you were coming down off the ass
and you thought, I love everybody.
See, you have to have a sensitivity treatment.
Wow, it was cool then.
Yes, all of the rock stars are now, as you say,
a rock star.
Sensitive.
Like me.
Yeah, sensitive.
Yeah, like us.
Rock on.
Ah, you're about as sensitive as a power shovel.
Wow.
What do you see in our country?
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.
Hurdy-gurdy.
Hurdy-gurdy.
Hurdy-gurdy.
Hurdy-gurdy.
Rikki-tikki-tobby.
Rikki-tikki-dos.
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.
So Superman.
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.
Singing songs of the world.
I don't think you should have brought up the 60s.
It was kind of a confusing period for us all.
The 60s, huh?
I'm bringing them up now.
Murder.
Murder.
They did it.
The 60s.
Here, just write in this.
Write in this green tambourine.
Well, how was that?
Was that a nice story of the 60s?
Well, there you have it.
The 60s.
We are here in investigating a rather jolly good time control.
But a time machine, I say.
Also, Kuya's relic modification by nuclear, you know.
My goodness me.
You can control time?
You can adjust the passage.
Yes, I believe it.
It's true, Alshap.
You can control and adjust the passage of time, I say.
Well, how do you make it?
Well, don't worry, I say.
I've got one right here.
In fact, as you can see, a strange and mysterious artifact of sorts.
And I dare say, observe here.
We shall go outside, I say, like so.
And come to me.
Would you look at this, fellas?
Prepare your eyes, I say.
It is a very time-controlling machine of sorts.
Well, it's just a clock.
No, it's not a clock, I say.
Look, Al.
We shall set the clock mode to p.m. like so.
And then it'll join first at 12 p.m.
And then at 3 o'clock.
And then at 6 o'clock.
And then at 9 o'clock.
And observe, old boy.
My goodness.
The body time is changing in real time, I say.
Well, I can't believe it.
Put it to 12 in the afternoon to prove it.
Ah, indeed.
Observe here, boy.
I say at 12 p.m. like so.
And there you go, I say.
Bob's your jolly time machine, young boy.
It's amazing.
Go do this.
The power of controlling time in your very hands.
It's a spinning show.
And I dare say, not only that, old boy.
If I observe.
Ah, yes.
Observe the position of the sun there.
Yes.
You will adjust the speed of time to times two or times five, I say.
My goodness, it's going to be very, very quickly now.
Precisely.
It's going to be up to a month's rate.
And now we shall stop the whole play field together.
It's very well stopped, I say, good to be old boy.
There's nothing happening.
Precisely.
My goodness me.
Good to be old boy.
I say at all times.
Can you do it again?
You, I fairly well stopped it.
You can also, yes, indeed, you can make it flow in reverse or indeed speed up.
But I say observe here, friends.
Yes.
With times stopped like so, the body water doesn't flow anymore because the body time
stopped, you know.
Goodness me.
When the time stopped like so, the body water stops to flow.
But precisely, old boy.
Also, it affects by a lot.
Yes.
What do you look at that?
The lava's remaining stationary, old chap.
It's a pure block.
It's a giant breakthrough and giant time machine of thousands, I say.
My goodness me.
Goodness me.
Controlling time in the very elements.
You're yourself in your very hand with your time control machine.
It's absolutely spiffing, old chap.
I could admit that you go, chaps and chaps, with the chance of passing through time with
your very own personal time machine of sorts, I say.
Goodness me.
You can just stay in bed all night forever and ever or you can get up and run around
in the daytime all the time forever and ever, do you wish?
Precisely, old boy.
Well observed.
Thank you, buddy, for that kind observation.
Good to be.
I say to you, my love.
Now, this hasn't even a game round about the observation of a rather jolly good Sequoia's
reticle time control machine modification, I say.
Put it back in the chest with your safe, I say.
I shall admit we will place it back in there for safekeeping, your boy.
Good show, I say.
Yes, you need it.
I say.
Why?
What?
What?
What's going on?
It's a plating platter.
Oh, what?
Ah.
What?
What?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!
I don't know what I think I want to say about this!
It's a time-dimensional space-time shift!
Rift! You've been using that machine and it's caused a huge split in the very fabric of creation itself!
It's a time dimension that's blown the whole ice to pieces!
Well I can see that because the time's going in fine times as normal speeds!
It's all gone wrong!
But what's going on here?
Well I don't know, you better get out of the picture!
It's starting to raise its...
It's a huge space-time dimension rupture, I say!
This is... this is very thunderous but this is the process of the...
Yeah! There goes the rope!
I'm a warrior in this year!
What will be the next stage?
Oh no, I just don't know!
Escape day and night. Merged. Night. Merged. Merged.
Rewind. Replay. Memory module malfunction. Hold for evaluation.
Access the memory module and rewind memory holograms
to starting the...
point six hours ago rewind commence playback to present time and recap after years of secretly
monitoring the public we were astounded so many people would willingly publicize where they lived
their religious and political views an alphabetized list of all their friends personal email addresses
phone numbers hundreds of photos of themselves and even status updates about what they were
doing moment to moment it is truly a dream come true for the cia it's not just the wars and the
awards that win them it's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes it's not just the terminal folds of nunu
it's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet
it's not just those starry old vex on the park benches with
looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of belson and auschwitz
it's not just the anesthesiologist for needy
it's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you
it's not just the dino bones for wotan it's not just the broken headlights snapped antenna and
human excrement
on your car hood it's not just that the old ways were best it's not just the bastardization and
perversion of every honest means of self-expression it's not just the killer ganja from the dark
side of the bush it's not just the pinoy snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop
it's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet
it's not just mongo in the congo with fafafas the size of basketballs
it's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness
it's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a

it's not just the battling eco freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is
needed to our breath and use it to help us survive it's not just the
living dead
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.
Shot salvation and fighting Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.
No, he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.
In his back pocket, just you try it.
But, scientists have no clue where exactly the tipping point lies.
They have no clue, they're smart guys.
They're smart, but they don't know, because this is a situation which has never been experienced before.
You dysfunctional, retarded, mentally ill derelict, demon scum, antichrist, spewing worthless, constipated balls of dung
from your funk and waggonel.
Ed para la chabolida.
Hija chavalera
that is



you ornncassifää
epic
Adivas fact
of death, the giant echo of no trickling down from overpaid, overfed lackeys.
The Gucci overlords and conservatives have always been black-hearted demons, and all
WTO representatives are their mutated, half-human, retarded stepchildren.
You're incontinent pond scum.
You spineless vegetable head of dead lettuce with the mental capacity of a swatch battery,
the cognitive skills of a pigeon, and the intelligent quotient of a dirt clod.
A blood clot for a brain and a softened skull you can poke your finger in like a stick of
hot butter.
Those little rodent eyes like two shiny black BBs that never blink, gazing away into empty
space, and a third eye on the side of the skull dripping ice knot, combing your hair
over so as not to scare children.
A dead third eye just above the right ear like a milky black protruding mole.
You're incontinent.


You black magician and puppet master, trained by Aleister Crowley and raised by feral goats.
Your entire philosophy is a bunk corporate hand job, and all your heroes are evil.
Ayn Rand is a walking brain hemorrhage.
Rush Limbaugh is a whimpering dehumanized thug.
Ronald Reagan is a diseased midget steeped in chocolate slim fast.
A plastic toad.
A horrible scab-infected abortion.
A demonic fascist.
A pathetic worm with dogmatic sermons for an entire life.
An industrial cesspool.
A space heater filled with human waste and cat hair.
A fan of John Tesh.
A corporate shill.
A floating green turd in the punch bowl of life.
Oh yes dear friends, and that was either James Inman or Adam W. Lewis dot com.
Anyway, it's called Hilarious Video of Seattle Man Addressing City Council.
And that's all I know.
This show, Hour of Slack, was not assembled by I, Stang, or me, but by Reverend Bucky
Argyle.
Before that last bit, we heard a little bit of the Puzzling Evidence show.
We heard G. Gordon Gordon doing the classic rant, It's Not Just The, which I believe
he recorded in Bolivia in the early 80s.
Before that, Onion News Network CIA Facebook.
Snippet from an Irishman.
Iron Man cartoon.
Before that, the long hard to understand time control machine is from Minecraft Mod Speed
Up in Reverse Time with Relic, a YouTube.
Reverend Bucky may be British, and it may be easier for them to understand that.
Before that, Puzzling Evidence on the 60s with Phineas Narco and Dr. Howell.
The 13th Floor Elevators did the song Levee.



Before that, a backward stretch of Reverend Susie the Flusie preaching.
Before that, a regular stretch of Sister Chris from the old days.
She used to be on WFMU.
The song Traveling with Berlitz was by Crust.
Before that, quote, I lost this guy's URL, unquote.
Sperm and an Egg was from YouTube.
Before that, a fast version of the MTV show.




Before that, a fast version of the MTV Subgenius commercial that I did, and a low frequency
Dr. Howell narrating our video arrives.
Praise Bob and thank you.
Oh, if you need to know more, subgenius.com is the place to go.
And thanks to Reverend Bucky Argyle for saving me quite a bit of time.
Argyle.
Argyle.
Argyle.
Argyle.
Argyle.
