1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,380
You know, outside organizations are wonderful,

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,640
but they can only supplement the example and inspiration

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,260
children should first receive from their...

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,680
So genius, powerful, smart.

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,160
Within a year, most of the juveniles that exist today

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,100
would disappear because the family that prays together

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,500
stays together.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,920
Remember, what we are looking for is that not only in space,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,380
but also in time.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,180
Because first it will be awkward, and then strange,

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,960
and then weird, and then awful.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
Will you shut up?

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,140
It's your problem.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,700
And we, you know, went through some pretty serious shit back then.

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,560
Anything in particular?

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,000
I think that you're driving me mad.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
You're driving me mad.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,260
You're driving me mad.

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,100
You're driving me mad.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,520
You are driving me mad, emphasized.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,420
Can you put your finger on why this might be?

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,520
Well, there's...

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,460
That's a lot of stuff to talk about.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,900
Let's go back to the very beginning.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Nothing so good as a heart in pain.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,820
Nothing so sad.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Nothing so sad.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,540
As a tear in vain.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,540
It is delight.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,640
Call me a bunch of idiots.

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Teenage girls.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Biggest freak.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,000
Biggest freak.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,320
Bob is a no-talent performer

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,280
riding the crest of a wave of mass hysteria.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,180
Mass hysteria.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,780
Mass hysteria.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,420
No talent.

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,660
I don't know.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't know.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,140
I don't know.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,180
I don't even want to think about it.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,960
I don't want to think about it.

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,520
Think about it.

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:01,900
About it.

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,780
He ain't nothing but an idiot.

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,520
Bob can't sing.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,800
Can't play the guitar.

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,440
I can't do nothing.

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,020
Idiot.

51
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,360
Idiot.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,320
Never screamed at Bob.

53
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,380
Never screamed at Bob.

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,700
Bob.

55
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:14,960
Bob.

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,300
Bob.

57
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Bob.

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,980
Give up.

59
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,480
The idiots.

60
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,240
Well, I beat on it.

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,780
I have for quite a number of years.

62
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,200
With a little intelligence.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,320
Happy music.

64
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,460
But when you hear rock and roll, it gets you on fire.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,080
Or...

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,440
Rapid amount of action.

67
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,860
Bob.

68
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,160
Bob.

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,560
Bob.

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Bob.

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,440
Little wiggle.

72
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,180
My wiggle.

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,760
And they keep us in business.

74
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,840
I mean, the rhythm and the action.

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Every movement will bring a surge of screams.

76
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,380
When I was with Bob.

77
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, did Bob turn you over?

78
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,780
He's a very amusing guy.

79
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,420
I really feel that he means well and that he does not mean to exploit women.

80
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,160
I know I've complained a lot about his making me take my clothes off over and over and the sex.

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
It helped to be drunk.

82
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,660
It helped to be drunk.

83
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,800
It helped to be drunk.

84
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
It helped to be drunk.

85
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,560
It helped to be drunk.

86
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:02,780


87
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,140
And so you could sort of say, well, there he is right on top of me.

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,540
Like a little bear.

89
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,920
Like those little doodle-deedle.

90
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,200
Too little, actually.

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
And that's the first time we ever heard that complaint about Bob, dear friends.

92
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,760
Too little?

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,860
Usually they gripe that there are too many.

94
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,780
Friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number 1206 from the Church of the Subgenius.

95
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm your host and prayer partner, Reverend Bob.

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,920
And I am wildoing in Slack because that gigantic subgenius history online class is finally over.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,200
And X Day is coming.

99
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:50,380
In fact, July 5th is when we subgeniuses will migrate to Brushwood, the clothing optional resort and campground in Sherman, New York,

100
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,980
where we shall await the end of the world of the normals and a new world for we the dues-paying.

101
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,780
And ordained subgeniuses.

102
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,940
As opposed to you mere gimme-Bob type listeners.

103
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,380
We know this must be the year because it's the 14th year we've awaited those saucers on July 5th.

104
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,600
And 14 is the charm.

105
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,020
But I can't advertise on this fine public supported non-commercial station.

106
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,340
So if you want the inside scoop on what we're really up to, you can look at subgenius.com.

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,820
And before I forget, credits, friends.

108
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,640
The opening collages going backwards in upside down order were by Puzzling Evidence,

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,260
Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com,

110
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,480
The Kleptones spelled with a K,

111
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,100
and Mr. Fernando Nandi Lemur.

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,180
We have some new songs and some nice live recordings from all over subgenius land this week.

113
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,840
But we'll start with the Instructators Instructorings from the Puzzling Evidence show on KPFA

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,340
with host Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond,

115
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,620
and from AskDrHal.com, Dr. Hal.

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,720
But you must ask yourself, are you a subgenius?

117
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Can you hack XDAY?

118
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,100
It's an awesome, momentous decision, but you have to make it and you have only a few seconds to make it.

119
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,000
And number five is to be used only in an emergency.

120
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,480
Don't forget, the special instructions about number seven, which will not be repeated until the top of the next hour.

121
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,780
Now that you're ready for it.

122
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,320
Stay tuned.

123
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,220
Page 12.

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Do we have our instructors in the audience waiting to be instructed by this instructional video?

125
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,380
Now don't obstruct the instruction from our instructors.

126
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,540
Look, that instructor's sleeping over there. Somebody kick his foot. Wake him up.

127
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,540
Obfuscating internal...

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
What? What?

129
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,960
Now, Hal, if you know, we want 100% anticipation.

130
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,620
Well, now isn't that asking a little too much?

131
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,000
None of this instructor obstruction will be...

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,260
...tolerated.

133
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,840
Did the instructor leave enough time to read the process and discuss the information?

134
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,540
Maybe enough time to process the information in some classes, but not enough time for discussion?

135
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,620
Whereas here, we have nothing but discussion time.

136
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:25,160
We don't even think about process. We just think only about discussion. That's what happens. The process gets fractured in the process.

137
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
The matter under discussion.

138
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:36,960
It's like the process of the process is a procedure that we will no longer allow to be utilized in this haphazard manner, causing the evaluation forms to be skewed.

139
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,280
I think we need to demand a little better legibility on the workshop evaluation forms from our class participants.

140
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,040
None of that crying, you little sniffering rats.

141
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,440
Oh, he's a little shaver.

142
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,340
And how well...

143
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,740
How well did the instructor...

144
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,900
...mix the drinks?

145
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Well, you know, you're putting a lot on that instructor, man. He had to do everything. I mean, he's only human. How is he going to get all that stuff?

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,860
You know, we've got to look to a leader. Where are we going to go unless we don't look to the instructor?

147
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,800
I mean, we have to look to someone with leadership qualities because we're just a bunch of sheep.

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,320
Ah, to that. We must look to the living slack man.

149
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:34,700
You know, we've got to look to the master, J.R. Bob Dobbs, for direction. He can inspire you, as he did Reverend Sweetness McGee, heard here spilling out his rant of liquid slack.

150
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,340
This is the first time in a long time, without time, that I am talking to you.

151
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,800
So here it is, brothers and sisters, my rant of liquid slack.

152
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:06,560
For the only thing sub about being subgenius is being below lowbrow. Sub infinitum. Underground ain't obscure enough. And tastelessness is salty with a hint of sour.

153
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,140
Weeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,340
And it is left behind on a curve of urban camping, busking for pennies.

155
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,780
Cookery abounds, yet it loses its impotence. Like a punch-drunk Viagra donkey after poised coitus matlock re-drinking.

156
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:21,780


157
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,640
I need more. But not because I have not. But to feel more. Put the needle on the record.

158
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,460
Abnormality withdraws. Like a kid who rides too many roller coasters. The log plumes are passe.

159
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,400
Gimme triple loops, quadruple shoops, quintuple roots. The Yeti blood boils in the brain.

160
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,560
We have each other. For now.

161
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,860
Drawn by the inexplicable dice roll.

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,560
TWENTY!

163
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,280
Double damage, motherfuckers! You got it right in the third eye!

164
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
Break out the squeegee!

165
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,900
Squeak, squeak!

166
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Streakless, while streaky.

167
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,860
The phallus flopping to the beat of the meat.

168
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,160
Hamburger with mayo, no mustard.

169
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,340
The end times are near. Duh!

170
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,260
Bob is my retarded uncle who thinks everything is funny.

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,420
Bob is my big brother.

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,880
Who watches out for them.

173
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Bob is my underpicked teacher who gives a damn.

174
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Bob is my fleshlight in a world of darkness.

175
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,980
Bob is the round peg in the square hole.

176
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,780
Bob is not smiling. He's glaring.

177
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,520
Bob is not quite equal to some of his dots.

178
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,880
Thank you.

179
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,280
Praise Bob!

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Praise Bob!

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Praise Bob!

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:10:04,600
Bob is my fleshlight in a world of darkness.

183
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,320
Bob is not smiling. He's glaring.

184
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,860
Bob is my big brother who watches out for them.

185
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:27,700
Bob is not quite equal to some of his shots.

186
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,740
It's double damage, motherfuckers. You got it right in the third eye.

187
00:10:46,920 --> 00:11:01,580
No. It stems from your complex. You are not normal. You are screwed up. I'm a mutant.

188
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,520
You're a mutant.

189
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:42,960
But like I say, we're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

190
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:53,000
I understand them. They don't understand me. They are the normals. They're all that I'm not.

191
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:02,800
But I'm a subgenius, a whole different species. If I had my way, they all would be shot.

192
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:13,620
For when I was young, the pigs ruled the world. Now all that has changed, cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

193
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,240
I spit on normals cause I hate their guts.

194
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:27,040
I am a subgenius. I am a subgenius.

195
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:37,300
They like their jobs for all the wrong reasons. They wear me down with their false holler smiles.

196
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,280
But my kind triumphed and now we will kill them.

197
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,720
Dead Normals!

198
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:55,120
bodies for mile after mile. For when I was young, the normals held sway. Now all that has changed,

199
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:09,340
cause Bob has his day. My shoe will soon kick a hole in their butts. I am a subgenius. I am a

200
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:20,580
subgenius. I am not bitter for all they did to me. They're only humans. They're deaf, mute, and

201
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:32,460
blind. But I am a subgenius, and I have a duty. The utter destruction of all humankind. For when I

202
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:39,020
was young, the pinks ruled the world. Now all that has changed, cause Bob's

203
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,260
flat.

204
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:56,560
Soon I will grind their face in the dust. I am a subgenius. I am a subgenius. Thank you.

205
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,500
A Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite there singing his song, I Am a Subgenius,

206
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,160
live at X Day Drill 1998. Friends, did you know that Uncle Onan

207
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,240
is what you might call my secret ghost speech writer and co-author on our latest book,

208
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,040
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack, eh? And just the cutest thing, that's what all the girls say.

209
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,460
Before Onan, a bit from The Large. He is large and I am small. Anyway, let us now return to

210
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,700
The Puzzling Evidence Show of May 22nd, where Dr. Philo Drummond addresses some of the critical

211
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,440
eye issues of our eye times. I think there should be an awesome movie app for my new iPhone.

212
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,540
So when we begin our movie discussions. You did? Okay. Maybe is it, is it like right on the tip of your tongue?

213
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,680
No, it's gone. If you hold it in front of your eye teeth, maybe they can read it and see what it was.

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,960
Okay, here we go. Eye teeth.

215
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,780
The silence of the universe increases daily.

216
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,740
Eye teeth? Come on, don't mess around.

217
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,780
Nor without horror.

218
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,060
Wait a minute. Aren't your eye teeth artificial?

219
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,620
It's just funny to them. Yeah, they are.

220
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, they're not going to be able to read. You need real eye teeth.

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,820
The chorus of the Egyptians.

222
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,400
No.

223
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,880
From all sides.

224
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,020
I'm stuck on a cartoon.

225
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Proclaim him.

226
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,360
Well, we can imagine how big the food is going to be in this cartoon.

227
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,800
We can imagine all the good things that are going to happen.

228
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,120
And not worry about when our face gets stuck in an electric fan.

229
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,500
Ow!

230
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,640
Or how it puts a shotgun and blows you in the face.

231
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,420
Shoots you in the face with a double-barreled shotgun.

232
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,180
And all you end up with is a, like a charcoal-looking, hideous simulacra of some ancient.

233
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,780
Hey, wait, wait.

234
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
Now, it went all thug on us.

235
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,860
Shanting as the ball turned out free.

236
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,680
Turned out free.

237
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,880
Hey, Dave, you were talking to me on the phone earlier about being concerned about all the human killings.

238
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,860
Because I know you're kind of softy about those creatures.

239
00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm looking at the CNN website, which always has a survey on it, right?

240
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,860
This particular survey says that, asks, does one nation have the right to tell another nation whether it can launch a rocket?

241
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,800
Yes or no?

242
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:23,420
And I'm not going to vote, but it seems that 57% says that one nation does not have the right to tell another nation whether it can launch a rocket.

243
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:30,880
And 43% feel that it is okay to tell another nation not to launch a rocket.

244
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,440
So 43% think it's okay to tell other people what to do?

245
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?

246
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,000


248
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?

249
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,820
I mean, by definition, when you make a rocket, you're going to launch it anyway.

250
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,760
I mean, give me a break.

251
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,120
That's what rockets are for.

252
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,920
Deep, deep, deep.

253
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,040
We are joined by stops around the world.

254
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,400
We are joined by stops around the world.

255
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,880
Mm-hmm.

256
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:05,360
Yeah, it's natural, cool, yet a powerful tremendous, especially young people, teenagers, going to ship powerful.

257
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,340
Later on, Doctor.

258
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,220
Mm-hmm.

259
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,000
It's just so exciting.

260
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000


261
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,280
It's just so exciting.

262
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,920
The enormous timber upright up.

263
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,520
This is no small two by four piece of lumber.

264
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,020
It's a huge long beam.

265
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,100
Cruel dick, cruel dick.

266
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,860
These fictions were becoming quite routine.

267
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,560
Common criminals all the way to the butt.

268
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,760
And I was out.

269
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,300
Go ahead.

270
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,860
Full of men.

271
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,900
Let's go back.

272
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,980
You got to have it today.

273
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,340
Scum of the earth, barbarians.

274
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,820
Scum of the earth, barbarians.

275
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,200
Scum of the earth, barbarians.

276
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,240
And now they're nailing him.

277
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,660
Scum of the earth, barbarians.

278
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,980
That is a mouthful.

279
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
That is a mouthful.

280
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,340
And hung, and hung the Nietzsche's, the Barter's, the Darwin's, the Lenin's, the Marx's.

281
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,780
And fully grasp the meaning of it physically.

282
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,040
Fill that hole.

283
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,380
Fill that hole.

284
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,120
Fill that hole.

285
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,420
Fill that hole.

286
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,580
Fill that hole.

287
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,880
It's just trouble.

288
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,280
That trouble you were talking about.

289
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,280
Everything's trouble now.

290
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,200
The whole thing.

291
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,880
You know, everything.

292
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,540
Everything's trouble.

293
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
I had a moment of trouble just as I was driving.

294
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,020
I was going real fast.

295
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,480
I was going fast.

296
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,440
This is trouble.

297
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,680
Then I saw Johnny Law behind me going, zoom right in on me.

298
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,660
The cops.

299
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,580
And then, he's...

300
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,480
This was...

301
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,580
On the way over here.

302
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:27,860
On the way over here.

303
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,140
You weren't...

304
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,880
You weren't...

305
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,220
You were just driving, right?

306
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,560
You were just driving.

307
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,900
Just driving like a drunk guy at 2.30 in the morning.

308
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,620
Oh, you're driving.

309
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,020
That guy must be loaded.

310
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,040
I have a good time.

311
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,600
Because nobody's on the road.

312
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah, I do that a lot myself.

313
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,380
I get on sometimes on the freeways.

314
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,160
Nobody there.

315
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,040
But tonight, for some reason, it seemed more crowded.

316
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,680
It was like late night revelers.

317
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,700
At 2.30, listen to the end of the Over the Edge.

318
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,140
And then listen to the show.

319
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,740
Right now, they're out there driving.

320
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,480
And their wives are all unhappy when they drive in at 5.02.

321
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,060
And the show's over.

322
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah.

323
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,340
That's what it is.

324
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,780
Well, I guess.

325
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,760
I think that's what it is, too.

326
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,100
This guy's just awake.

327
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,380
He's down there slaughtering cattle.

328
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,340
Why are you doing that?

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
He's just left his...

330
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,960
He fell asleep in the car.

331
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,120
He's laying in the car with the radio on.

332
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,380
The saliva is...

333
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,240
Spread out in the beer.

334
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,860
Falling out in the beer vomit.

335
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,660
He's mixing with the saliva on the front seat.

336
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,440
The show turned up all the way.

337
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
The show turned up all the way.

338
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,040
Yeah, we're looking at your house right now.

339
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,440
Yeah.

340
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,740
It's 1-841 Warren Drive.

341
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,600
Okay, I'm going there.

342
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm going to go to 1-841.

343
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,900
Don't go there.

344
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,220
Don't go there.

345
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm going to go there.

346
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:51,820
That's trouble.

347
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,080
I don't know if it's going to be anywhere nearby.

348
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,580
Don't you understand?

349
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,500
No, I don't understand.

350
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,020
It's a trouble problem.

351
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,160
Yeah, we are.

352
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,580
We're aware of the caliber of disaster

353
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,580
indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.

354
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,260
Yep, trouble.

355
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,940
Well, you got trouble, my friend.

356
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,500
Right here, I take trouble right here in River City.

357
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,800
Why, sure, I'm a billiard player.

358
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,100
Certainly, mighty proud to say I'm always mighty proud to say it.

359
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,640
He just lets those words just spill right out.

360
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Mary, Mary.

361
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,040
Have you cultivate horse sense?

362
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,200
You're a bullhead with a keen eye.

363
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,680
Did you ever think and try to find an ironclad lead for yourself?

364
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, he was like Billy Graham.

365
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,340
He was convincing.

366
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,760
But just as I say, it takes judgment, brains, and maturity to score in a box-time game.

367
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,440
I say that...

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,920
And then he booms.

369
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,520
And then he booms.

370
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:33,740
And then he booms.

371
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:33,740


372
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,320
And then he booms.

373
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,620
And then he booms.

374
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,900
And then he booms.

375
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,660
And I call that soft.

376
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,860
1841, Warren Drive.

377
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,760
And then I say first, medicinal wine from a teaspoon, then beer from a bottle.

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,460
Yeah?

379
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Oh, wait a minute.

380
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,920
What's the matter?

381
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll call you back.

382
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,020
What?

383
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,180
Hello.

384
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,160
Oh, yes.

385
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,960
Glad you called.

386
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,900
Well, they the boat that boat.

387
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,540
So?

388
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,160
So, popper the water.

389
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,800
What's the matter?

390
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,640
Somebody just came in the front bag.

391
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,220
What do you mean?

392
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Hello.

393
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,740
Hello.

394
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,500
That was Lemur.

395
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,460
Well, not Lemur himself, but a Lemur piece.

396
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:21,500
Before that, a puzzling evidence show starring QuiveringBrain.com, AskDrHal.com, and YouTube

397
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,220
slash PuzzlingEvidenceTV.

398
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,900
And now, from Lemur...

399
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,300
Hey, you're not even listening.

400
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,900
Wake up!

401
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,900
Hmm?

402
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

403
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I was daydreaming.

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,060
About Dobbs?

405
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,340
As usual, about Dobbs.

406
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,580
Me?

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
Cling thinks I'm in the same class as Dobbs.

408
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,000
I know.

409
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh, thanks.

410
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,260
Look, no one, not even an admitted genius such as Dobbs, could miss how the trick is done.

411
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,640
Dobbs, he...

412
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes?

413
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,620
What were you going to say?

414
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm not sure.

415
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Dobbs said I had the whole head.

416
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

417
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,540
That's right.

418
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,180
So that night, I went to see Dobbs.

419
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,420
It's nice of you to come to see me.

420
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,980
I was wondering if you'd forgotten me.

421
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,100
No, you're not forgotten, Dobbs.

422
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,080
It's quite the contrary.

423
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:11,740
Oh?

424
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,320
Yes, I don't.

425
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,240
Certainly, please do.

426
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,920
Thanks.

427
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,060
May I offer you a drink?

428
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,660
Please do.

429
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,240
Oh, I'm glad.

430
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,560
Yes, I'm very happy.

431
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm not.

432
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,360
Hmm.

433
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
I even mentioned that, I think.

434
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,100
Yes, you did.

435
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,740
Yes.

436
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,860
Go on.

437
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,920
Hmm.

438
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,380
You see, Dobbs, I...

439
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,240
Okay, boys, come on in.

440
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,980
Huh?

441
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,860
But just a moment.

442
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,020
In the beginning, everything was the same.

443
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,340
A glob of cosmic soup expanding at a very fast rate

444
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,120
and existing at a very high temperature.

445
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,460
Because the faster things move, the hotter things are.

446
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,960
In the early universe, things were moving incredibly fast,

447
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
so it was incredibly hot.

448
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
In the instant an atom was created, it was annihilated,

449
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,380
by high-energy collisions.

450
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,940
Only after about 500,000 years was it cool enough

451
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,240
for the atoms to coalesce.

452
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,060
The energy of collisions was no longer sufficient

453
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,000
to disengage or overwhelm the proton-electron attraction.

454
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,400
For the first time, you have distinction.

455
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,940
There's a place in space where there is an atom

456
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
and a place where there isn't.

457
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,520
You have structure.

458
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,940
You can then have individual entities.

459
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,640
Matter.

460
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Stars.

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,480
Galaxies.

462
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,860
Life.

463
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,920
Taste is also a distinction.

464
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,480
You can tell an apple pie from any other kind of pie.

465
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,780
The exception being that beyond a critical temperature,

466
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,640
there is only temperature.

467
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,820
There is no easily discernible distinction.

468
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,740
You have just tasted the early universe.

469
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,280
Wow.

470
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,640
What worries me is that the singularity already happened.

471
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,000
Ah, you know, I don't...

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,340
It's funny, I heard your little thing on the singularity as a belief system.

473
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:57,720
I don't know.

474
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,740
It's merely an idea.

475
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,420
Yeah, besides, if it's real singularity,

476
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,780
it can only happen one time,

477
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,340
so how can we talk about it forever?

478
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
No, that's what I'm saying.

479
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,240
It's like we hit our peak sometime in the past few thousand years,

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,220
and it's all been downhill since then.

481
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,400
It just appears to us to be progress,

482
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,360
but that's a mistaken...

483
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,720
It's just a possibility.

484
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm not saying that.

485
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,860
I do not believe that human nature has changed one iota

486
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,540
in all of recorded history.

487
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, yes, I have.

488
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,880
We've developed a language.

489
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,420
We've looked the same 100 times.

490
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,420


491
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,420


492
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,240
100,000 years ago,

493
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,060
but we didn't have as good language centers in our brain.

494
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,460
100,000 years ago...

495
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,820
Yeah, it's hard to say,

496
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,220
but 100,000 years ago,

497
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,120
we basically still lived like chimpanzees.

498
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,740
But we looked like we do now.

499
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,780
Yeah, there's evidence to be contrary.

500
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,400
But think about 10,000 years ago,

501
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,180
we were probably more skilled and more everything than we are now.

502
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,380
Think about Utsi or whatever his name is,

503
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,360
the Iceman, when they...

504
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,460
100,000 years ago,

505
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,420
human beings had all...

506
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,280
They already colonized far greater areas than chimpanzees ever will.

507
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,820
Even chimpanzees have little tool factories they use to gather...

508
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

509
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,040
They're definitely smarter than chimpanzees.

510
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,700
What I'm saying is the language element and so forth

511
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,400
didn't start showing up.

512
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,960
That was a gradual mutation.

513
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,940
Long after our bodies had become more or less skeletally

514
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,880
and in a muscular way, the way they are now,

515
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,620
it still took a while for our brains to get...

516
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,400
Even as small...

517
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,460
As smart as we are now.

518
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,360
And that ain't saying much.

519
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,740
There is...

520
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,460
So that's my only worry about...

521
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,420
I understand the singularity.

522
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,980
My problem is I feel the ideogularity breathing down my neck all the time.

523
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,260
I don't...

524
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,400
This movie that we're stuck in right now,

525
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,700
this one really, it makes my...

526
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,640
It kind of makes me feel anxious about what's going to happen next.

527
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,900
I think there's some level of...

528
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,920
Reacher with the Adam brain meets a monster that challenged the world.

529
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,340
Impending.

530
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,400


531
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,320
Potential destruction of our very...

532
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,480
Very souls.

533
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,380
But there's no more dramatic tension

534
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,280
because we all know that's actually going to happen.

535
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,560
Like a huge weight lift.

536
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:11,860
It is.

537
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,580
It was like a weight lifted off our shoulders.

538
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,120
Yeah, I mean, once you just admit that we're all doomed,

539
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,260
everything becomes easier.

540
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,080
Yeah, the depressive...

541
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,700
Don't worry, everything's...

542
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,380
And then, of course, there's that anticipation

543
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,580
that the clock ticks for five.

544
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,740
Yeah, it's the ticking time bomb,

545
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,620
which means we have to torture each other

546
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,780
to find out when the show's coming to an end.

547
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,460
Here, take this water.

548
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,100
Here, take this board.

549
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,880
Oh!

550
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
How many minutes?

551
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,520
Members of the board.

552
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah, we know that the ticking of the clock makes you under...

553
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,160
It's not so much anxiety as it is...

554
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,840
Oh, sorry.

555
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,960
...inevitability.

556
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,340
Something that you know is ultimately the time will run out.

557
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,660
So it stood 90 years on the floor.

558
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,000
That thing that you...

559
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,980
It was taller by half than the old man himself.

560
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,340
Then that thing that you wish will happen.

561
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,220
It will happen.

562
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,680
It will happen.

563
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,080
Now, this music informs the listener that...

564
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Cool, isn't it?

565
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,220
...there's some salvation, partial redemption

566
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,820
at the end of the anxious, anticipatory inevitability.

567
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,260
Wow, look at that.

568
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,280
Well, Herman Goering had a great train set, too.

569
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,400
Herman Goering, yeah.

570
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,080
Herman Goering...

571
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,800
What are you talking about?

572
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,880
Between killing and running trains...

573
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,520
In the basement of his house at Caranval,

574
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,260
he had a huge train layout.

575
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,240
What?

576
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,340


577
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


578
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


579
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


580
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


581
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


582
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,400


583
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,200
I guess we have to go there now.

584
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,320
It's a hell of a set of real.

585
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,040
I feel like that was a burning man for a minute.

586
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,440
He was getting ready to start dancing.

587
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,280
He was going to spin around in a whirling dervish.

588
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,560
He must have an enormous space in his house developed

589
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,040
for these beautiful model trains.

590
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh, no!

591
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,940
There's a killer loose.

592
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,200
I know.

593
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,340
No.

594
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,400
Not in his nose.

595
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Well, at least it's not in his nose.

596
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,560
Lemur's nose.

597
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,780
Before that, puzzling evidence, and I do mean puzzling,

598
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,560
and before that, a clip from Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia

599
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,400
on WCN.

600
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
WCSB Cleveland, Sundays at 10 p.m.

601
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,500
In this case, with callers Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

602
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,280
Dr. Agon, and myself.

603
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,680
Now, let us descend into the 2008 Baltimore subgenius revival

604
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,960
with Priestess Pisces introducing Reverend Carter LeBlanc's

605
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
reading of Reverend Jimbo's rant.

606
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,160
Fade in!

607
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Anyway, I need Carter's help, and I've got a story to tell.

608
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,400
Recently, I got a message, and if any of you were here last year,

609
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,140
you know what I mean.

610
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,560
Last year, there was a subgenius named Jimbo D'Limbo who was here,

611
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,300
who currently can't be with us because he's in an undisclosed location

612
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,620
in a country you might have heard of called Iraq.

613
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:24,420
And he basically got in touch with me and said that he wanted something red.

614
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,260
And I read it over and realized that I couldn't do it

615
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,380
because I don't have a penis.

616
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,780
I don't have a penis.

617
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,740
It sort of requires a penis, and since Carter, I believe, has a penis,

618
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,240
I think that he can handle this for me.

619
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,980
So what Carter will be reading is a message to everyone in the room

620
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,620
from Jimbo D'Limbo, who is currently at an undisclosed location somewhere in Iraq.

621
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,400
Thank you.

622
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,940
So this is Jimbo's epistle to the Baltimore.

623
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,440
Friends, we live in times of great distress.

624
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,420
War, and rumors of war, economic and ecological disasters,

625
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,180
and lack of predictable saucer landings are all prominent

626
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,640
on this densely populated, slowly orbiting turd.

627
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:29,860
All good signs that if J.R. Bob Dobbs wasn't exactly right,

628
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,140
he was at least...

629
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,440
I'm not sure if I'm on the mark enough to put Stang's money where his mouth is.

630
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,840
But where does that leave us, the allegedly loyal followers of I?

631
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,220
Warning.

632
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,080
The following sentence is potentially anti-Slack,

633
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,540
should not be read, viewed, or listened to before engaging apathy scream.

634
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,400
It is increasingly obvious as we near ex-Day 11

635
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,360
that we have made a grave miscalculation

636
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,180
in relying on the...

00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:13,200
SCP-614level jednak guy energy drawn in.

638
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,620

We believe in the battleship верх and it is times��gged

you are not a cubicle drone you are a one man office supply liberation front

this is the time to be a man and not a woman

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,900
this is the time to be a man and not a woman

660
00:32:52,900 --> 00:33:00,760
this sad little ball of dirt is currently an upheaval I know I almost upheave every time I pay attention for too long

661
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:15,640
but through these methods as well as outreaches both established and newly developed we can maintain a lasting presence at least until the apocalypse

662
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,880
stay tuned for the next Jimbo Dilimbo Featured Tips and Tricks for Urban Grounds

663
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:39,600
and the work there with applications for the coming dark ages that was a missive from our dear Dr. Jimbo Dilimbo currently doing unspeakable things in unspeakable places everybody give a praise Bob

664
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,080
Hey Bob

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,320
Ha

666
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,480
Ha

667
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah

668
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,660
And a praise Jimbo Dilimbo

669
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Praise Jimbo Dilimbo

670
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,120
Oh

671
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:14,460
This is the time for this

672
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,480
the short erzähl

673
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,880
You see here

674
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,280
Here we go

675
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,880
The Citations

676
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:29,450
virtues, far from it. We're all beneficiaries of the cult of the elite. But if we deny its

677
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:35,010
dangers and the all-consuming power of its propaganda, then we...

678
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:42,130
Bet nobody ever said that to you. Oh, by the way, Bob, thanks for the aspirin.

679
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,370
Why did you call me a...

680
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:45,610
Bob?

681
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,690
I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings. It just seems simpler to tell them what they

682
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,350
wanted to hear.

683
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,310
I'm not...

684
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,590
Bob?

685
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,110
I know.

686
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,530
We have to...

687
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,110
Not on this show.

688
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,410
I'm telling you, I can...

689
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,030
You need a doctor for that.

690
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,730
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you really don't have a tour, right?

691
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,830
Ten million years of this is as far as the species has evolved?

692
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,570
I'm not...

693
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:29,790
Bob?

694
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,490
I know. You're something special, something different.

695
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,410
You do not know...

696
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:37,710
Bob?

697
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,850
No, but I want to know...

698
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,130
Bob?

699
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:47,330
Everybody wants to know Bob, they just don't know that yet. Thanks to Reverend Sweetness

700
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,930

704
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,290
Bob in the Bottle presents...

705
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,210
The exciting, fun-filled game for the entire family.

706
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,490
I warm welcome to another half hour of fun and excitement on...

707
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,810
I was thinking I was reading that.

708
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,610
It's okay, audience.

709
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:18,610


710
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:18,890
I'm not...

711
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,930
I'm not...

712
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,450
I'm not...

713
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,130
It's okay, audience. Would you like to play the game?

714
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,650
Well, what is it?

715
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,170
Yes, that's how we play the game. And by the way, you folks at home will have a mystery

716
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,950
voice to help you. It's a sixth sense, a sense of intuition going up, up, up. Bob's the natural...

717
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,970
In the Bottle.

718
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,670
In the Bottle.

719
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,010
Alaska, China, and Montana.

720
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,070
But now let's have a word with our newcomers who have some different ideas.

721
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,910
And we want everyone to come. It's just a lot of fun to come.

722
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,910


723
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,910


724
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,910


725
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,710
The details and all that money will go to the same cause.

726
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,110
The...

727
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,910
Bob in the Bottle. Naturally.

728
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,110
Fine porque you have?

729
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,230
Does a member of the other's team still want it?

730
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:57,870
Let's do it now.

731
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,570
All the way down.

732
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,550
think very carefully can you identify this damn

733
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,150
Cutting. Cutting.

734
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,310
No.

735
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,170
Cutting, cutting...

736
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:15,890
Oh, listen to this.

737
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,970
Here we go here. Listen, listen.

738
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:16,970


739
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,010
Uh, drill, uh, drill.

740
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,850
So close, listen.

741
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

742
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,790
Sorry, no, time's up.

743
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,750
Here, the sound's going in.

744
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,890
Ready to take a good deep whiff.

745
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,050
Smell the odor of balls.

746
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,990
One, two, three, quick.

747
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,930
Oh, she said it in that quick whiff.

748
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,290
They'll be tasting, baby.

749
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,970
They'll be touching hard.

750
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,050
Yeah, she can reach all the way down.

751
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,630
This can't hurt you in any way, Joan.

752
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,210
Don't get afraid.

753
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,930
It's not alive.

754
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,630
Can't hurt you.

755
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,070
Here we go.

756
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,270
Here's a towel for you, and there's one for you, Joan.

757
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,470
Well, everybody's buying more and more because in the bottle is a natural.

758
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,910
Naturally refreshing, naturally delicious.

759
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,390
That's why it's naturally everybody's favorite.

760
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:01,090
I'm going to have to point out that the human killings, I think they might be involved with the syntax.

761
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,250
So you're, uh.

762
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,190
Yeah, if you get your word over wrong.

763
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,190
You know, yeah.

764
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,250
You'd like to smoke.

765
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,390
Guys, syntax is.

766
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,890
And you're out of money, out of cigarettes.

767
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,370
Syntax is so important because if you don't have the right syntax,

768
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,250
your sentences are not going to be as good as they are.

769
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,970
They're not going to make any sense.

770
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:24,590
Only a cigarette smoker who has quit would think that a dog urinating on the floor in an argument with his mother is enough to shoot three police officers over.

771
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,270
Well, no, the real reason.

772
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,390
Or that somebody made fun of your accent is enough to go postal.

773
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:34,270
The guy in Pittsburgh was saying that, well, those damn pinko liberals are going to come take his guns away.

774
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,290
So he had to use them while he still could, I guess.

775
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,570
Right.

776
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,910
Well, that makes perfect sense.

777
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,670
It's funny how these paranoid militia types were completely underground for the last eight years.

778
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,250
You know, when we really weren't.

779
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,290
They were out of food and they're out of smokes.

780
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,090
Now they have something to do.

781
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,630
Well, yeah, that's true about the syntax and stuff.

782
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:59,810
But I think they should, the impropriety tax, we should, anybody who makes, who like farts in public or something should be not only exposed to public ridicule, but taxed.

783
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:00,910
There you go.

784
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,410
To the grave and beyond.

785
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,930
Well, I think everyone who pays that.

786
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,450
That would be part of the carbon emissions tax.

787
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,790
You could work it in there if you wanted, yeah.

788
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,110
Belching, any other form of exhalation.

789
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,190
From any orifice.

790
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,490
Said citizens shall be cited by the city of Cleveland Bluffs.

791
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:27,990
And before there'll be big PR campaign in the media, there'll be like Time or Newsweek and there'll be like a split screen of a man and a cow both burping and stuff.

792
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,170
And it'll say something like bovine and human.

793
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,030
How different are we really?

794
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,370
You know, my question is, do we sit in a cell?

795
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,670
How can we cash in?

796
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,010
How can we cash in?

797
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,230
Well, our friend, Mr.

798
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,170
Sister was worried.

799
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:54,850
That they would start taxing fat people on the basis that they were consuming more food than everybody else, which, of course, is not necessarily the reason somebody gets overweight.

800
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,890
It's not necessarily the reason to tax.

801
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,010
My poor paranoid friend.

802
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,030
I mean, he's actually a fairly spherical looking person.

803
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,490
He is kind of like Frosty the Snowman.

804
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,810
He was thinking that's what they're going to do next.

805
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,130
First, they're taxing us poor.

806
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,110
Poor.

807
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,150
Poor.

808
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:14,350
Poor.

809
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:14,350


810
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:14,350


811
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,330
Cigarette smokers.

812
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,410
And then they're going to start taxing us fat people for eating too much food.

813
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:26,610
And everybody who drives an SUV for being in an SUV and so forth.

814
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,370
I thought that was a little bit paranoid.

815
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:37,710
Of course, on the other hand, I've seen people be thrown in jail for 20 years because they had a hemp seed on their clothing somewhere.

816
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,090
And that is a sad, sad case.

817
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:40,930
For sure.

818
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,310
Yes.

819
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,950
So, you know.

820
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,810
A paranoid is merely someone in possession of all the facts.

821
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,230
Yep.

822
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,670
Fair is a river in Africa, as Nenslow said.

823
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,990
Yeah, but that's not true.

824
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,310
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you get a prize, my sister said.

825
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,590
She didn't get a prize for a pig either.

826
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,010
Life is definitely a competition.

827
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,570
I would say it's more like a rigged crap game.

828
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,150
Yeah, it's not fair because the winners always win.

829
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,450
I hate that.

830
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,350
Well, you know, whenever I'm a loser, it's like it's just not fair.

831
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,830
Well, the house you rig it for the losers are actually the winners.

832
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,590
Well, no, there's no 50 percent probability.

833
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,330
The house always has a slight rigging.

834
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,570
It's like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.

835
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,750
And then it'll be a nine.

836
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,570
And then you will be a one.

837
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,090
Well, I guess the decision is, do you want to work for the house or do you want to be the house?

838
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,630
Well, you could just, you know, or do you want to stay away from the house?

839
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,550
That's an option.

840
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,430
A lot of people don't.

841
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,130
Don't even think about what move away from the house.

842
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,250
You can just walk away to quote Ken Casey.

843
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,710
But see, in American culture now, we'd want to sell the house at a vastly rigged price.

844
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,350
I just walked away from my house.

845
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,970
Well, you were forced out by a court order.

846
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,990
We don't want to get into it right now.

847
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:12,910
Well, you know, it's right around in my neighborhood, the garbage cans and barrels that were nobody could sell for the last

848
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,430
few months.

849
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,610
I mean, I've been in the neighborhood for a couple of weeks now.

850
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,010
Suddenly the prices got so low that they're all being bought up.

851
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,370
The garbage cans and barrels.

852
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,050
Well, yeah.

853
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,890
And dumpsters and all the homes, you know, the homes around here.

854
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:31,130
Tents, the the cardboard boxes, the tin shacks, the crude wigwams.

855
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:31,670
You can take it.

856
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:38,150
Oh, man, if you've got a yurt, you're like the richest guy in the block.

857
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,970
Nobody here has a yurt.

858
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,010
Oh, is that over on the next block?

859
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,430
There's a couple of yurts.

860
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,950
Spreading out into the exurbs too widely.

861
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,370
There's just more space for the homeless to walk.

862
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,690
Only warlords can afford yurts anymore.

863
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,290
In a short period of time, we're going to.

864
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,990
It's funny.

865
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,390
If you go to other countries, actually, the poor all live in the fringes of the cities and the rich live in the city center.

866
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,290
Oh, gentrification.

867
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,090
Well, that's so they can get their lattes quicker.

868
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,090
Yeah.

869
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:13,430
And I've always thought it a little funny that people felt rich because they had to live in the city center.

870
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,430


871
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,430


872
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,770
And they had to drive an hour and a half to work and back every day.

873
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:17,530
Oh, yeah.

874
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,390
That was a little odd.

875
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,810
It's okay to be smart and it's okay to do things intellectually.

876
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,330
And it's also okay to do things with a gut reaction.

877
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,610
And it's also okay to combine the two.

878
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:42,210
And usually the way the media plays on the fears of the public, especially during the 50s and 60s, that anybody who had an IQ over 28, let's say, was probably a threat to the community.

879
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,790
Because.

880
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,290
You know.

881
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:49,130
A person who can think for himself is just liable to realize that commercials don't mean anything.

882
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,510
And what they write in the newspaper is wrong.

883
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:51,850
You know.

884
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,450
And it's fashionable to disparage people who are smart.

885
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:04,010
And the bad part about that is a lot of people who were born smart pretend to be dumb so they can have friends.

886
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,010
And that's a tragedy.

887
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,530
You know.

888
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:12,450
I try and encourage people, if they are intelligent, to not be ashamed of it and go out and do what you're going to do.

889
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:16,250
And forget about having friends and acting dumb in order to have friends.

890
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,730
Because those friends aren't going to do you any good anyway.

891
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,390
And if you know deep down in your heart that you are a dumb kind of a person, don't be ashamed of it.

892
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,690
You know.

893
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,750
That's the way you are.

894
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:26,490
Have a good time.

895
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:26,970
You're dumb.

896
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,030
You can sit in front of a television, drink beer and watch hockey and love it.

897
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,250
You have none of the problems of people who know more than you do.

898
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,730
Because the more you know, the less you'll like it.

899
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,590
So, you know.

900
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,750
Everybody should be happy with what they got.

901
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,290
Easy for you to say, Frank.

902
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:41,910
You're dead.

903
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,330
That was Frank Zappa on WCSB.

904
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,190
Before that, radio synesthesia.

905
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:54,690
But now, we must admire Philo and Dr. Hal as they admire a rich little boy's toy train.

906
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,930
Look at that engine.

907
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,070
Boy, that's loud.

908
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,550
That's a real toy train.

909
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,250
One that the kid can ride on.

910
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,690
He's looking at it.

911
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,850
He's actually feeding that little tiny train.

912
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,970
He's stoking the firebox and now he's...

913
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,950
And it's actually working.

914
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,490
He's using a...

915
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,850
And now he's oiling the wheels.

916
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,510
You know, better they have an intricate drive mechanism.

917
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,110
Now, that's not the way they do real trains.

918
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:25,310
They don't get giants out there to lift the various train cars and put them on like that.

919
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,050
I mean, look.

920
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,190
He is going to ride on it.

921
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:27,330
See?

922
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,230
Man, he's the luckiest kid in the world.

923
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,430
Yeah, how does he luck out with his cool train kit?

924
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,390
Yeah.

925
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,530
Why didn't we get the lucky...

926
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:36,710
Oh.

927
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,170
And then James Bond comes back.

928
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,110
Wow.

929
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:48,450
Just when we thought it was safe to go back into the CIA, suddenly there's a war going

930
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,010
on with the executive administration.

931
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,610
Or specter.

932
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:59,130
The secretariat for torture, murder, mayhem, and espionage.

933
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,270
The speaker of the house is somewhat chagrined.

934
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,290
Oh, yeah.

935
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,110
Johnny English.

936
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:06,830
This was great.

937
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,030
Did you see this?

938
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,670
This was funny.

939
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,650
See the movie?

940
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,090
Yeah.

941
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


942
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


943
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


944
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


945
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


946
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


947
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


948
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


949
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:10,090


950
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,610
I don't know.

951
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,030
No, I haven't, but I was going to just because of the music.

952
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,830
Yeah, you should if you're a Dean fan.

953
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,830
It's a good Dean movie.

954
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:18,890
Yeah, but...

955
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,910
Ladies and gentlemen, education holds America's future.

956
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,690
Perhaps your future.

957
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,450
The subgenius power of...

958
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,210
What?

959
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:33,630
What?

960
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,090
First to give you premium quality.

961
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:38,790
A felony.

962
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,070
And first to give you a good job.

963
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


964
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


965
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


966
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


967
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


968
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


969
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


970
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


971
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


972
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


973
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


974
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


975
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


976
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


977
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


978
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:40,070


979
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,030
And to give you scientific facts in support of smoking.

980
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:42,790
A felony.

981
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,070
And do it today.

982
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,930
I am so excited.

983
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:47,570
So excited.

984
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,030
I am so excited.

985
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,750
So excited.

986
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,250
We have got to get rid of...

987
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,910
Michelle Bachman.

988
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,450
We have got to get rid of...

989
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,130
Michelle Bachman.

990
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,630
I can't wait to get rid of...

991
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,350
Michelle Bachman.

992
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,450
Who does absolutely red hot lies.

993
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,550
Michelle Bachman wants red hot lies.

994
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,170
Uh, Michelle Bachman.

995
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,890
Michelle Bachman.

996
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:03,830
I can't believe...

997
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,190
Michelle Bachman.

998
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,910
Red hot lies.

999
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,590
Always...

1000
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,030
Weak.

1001
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,150
Makes your head spin.

1002
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,910
Red hot lies.

1003
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,190
You...

1004
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:08,630
Down.

1005
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,350
With that...

1006
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:09,690
Uh...

1007
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,050
Uh...

1008
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,050


1009
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,190
Uh...

1010
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:10,690
Uh...

1011
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,590
People.

1012
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,610
People.

1013
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,090
People.

1014
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,150
Even more young people.

1015
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,910
Man people.

1016
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:16,710
Red hot lies.

1017
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,590
People have to go.

1018
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,650
People are weak.

1019
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:19,370
Man...

1020
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:19,790
You know what?

1021
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:20,610
Do this again.

1022
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,370
Do this again.

1023
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,050
You know what?

1024
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:22,770
Michelle Bachman.

1025
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,390
Michelle Bachman.

1026
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,270
There is no way...

1027
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,410
Congresswoman Bachman.

1028
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,290
Congresswoman Bachman.

1029
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,050
Absolutely driving me crazy.

1030
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:28,370
Crazy.

1031
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,010
It just never seems to end.

1032
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,430
Crazy.

1033
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:30,870
No.

1034
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,730
Who is coming?

1035
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,190
Mm-hmm.

1036
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,510
Mm-hmm.

1037
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,630
What is happening?

1038
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,790
It just never seems to end.

1039
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,530
And it's crucial that your audience come out.

1040
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,030
Come out.

1041
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:38,370
Come out.

1042
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:38,670
I'm going...

1043
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:38,970
Come out.

1044
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,870
Absolutely driving me crazy.

1045
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,210
Come out.

1046
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,970
Absolutely driving me crazy.

1047
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,230
Come out.

1048
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,610
We have got to get rid of...

1049
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,250
Michelle Bachman.

1050
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:45,630
Crazy.

1051
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,790
We have got to get rid of...

1052
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:47,490
Michelle Bachman.

1053
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,570
Michelle Bachman wants red hot lies.

1054
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:49,890
Crazy.

1055
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,450
And I think people should be shocked.

1056
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,350
Well, these writers' consortiums are always on the very vanguard.

1057
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:04,010
This tippy pinpoint of an actual social movement is about to take over, and I think all of us

1058
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:09,870
talking about zombies so much tonight means that the zombie thing's going around, man.

1059
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,710
It's like...

1060
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,750
It's...

1061
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,210
You know what I mean?

1062
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:12,950
I see zombies everywhere.

1063
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,210
Like, holy zombie Jesus?

1064
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,510
No, we're all pondering the idea.

1065
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,330
Maybe we...

1066
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:18,890
Could we?

1067
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:19,430
Is it?

1068
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:20,870
Are they, you know...

1069
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,190
Oh, by the way, next week is...

1070
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,410
I wish.

1071
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,710
Next week is zombie Jesus day.

1072
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,930
Oh, that's right.

1073
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,330
It is.

1074
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:26,850
Yeah.

1075
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,030
That's one guy...

1076
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,730
It might cure the economy.

1077
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,230
There's a zombie repellent.

1078
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,790
Magic bunny day.

1079
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,570
I don't know.

1080
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,550
I think...

1081
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,190
Don't you wish they would have crucified the Easter bunny instead?

1082
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,070
I forgot.

1083
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:38,430
Yes.

1084
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,410
My dad did!

1085
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,730
He crucified it.

1086
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,730
Or might as well have.

1087
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,930
I thought it was the Easter bunny.

1088
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:47,170
Easter bunny.

1089
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:47,990
And Jesus should fight the dead.

1090
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,930
Strangled it, skinned it.

1091
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,950
And see who comes back to life.

1092
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,990
Pulled, gutted it.

1093
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,250
Actually gutted it, then skinned it.

1094
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:00,210
You know, roasted it, served it up for dinner.

1095
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,330
The Easter bunny.

1096
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:02,370
Yum.

1097
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:03,550
I think...

1098
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1099
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1100
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1101
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1102
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1103
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1104
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1105
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1106
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,550


1107
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,790
It never had a taste for rabbit since then.

1108
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,090
It looks like cat.

1109
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:10,430
Looks too much like cat, unless you make a stew of it.

1110
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,670
So when the Russian folks in your neighborhood were having ham, daddy had gone out and got

1111
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,710
himself a rabbit to serve on Easter day to show you damn kids what happens to the Easter

1112
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,030
bunny.

1113
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,090
Now, if that ain't country, I don't know what is.

1114
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,550
He raised rabbits.

1115
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,030
He still does, as a matter of fact.

1116
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,550
And I'll probably inherit the rabbits.

1117
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,530
I'll have to learn how to dress them.

1118
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,370
Dress a rabbit, a goat, and so forth.

1119
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,930
I know what this economy's...

1120
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,590
Where this economy's going.

1121
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,410
I've dressed a goat before.

1122
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,030
I'm developing a taste for squirrel.

1123
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:48,850
We have a little squirrel farm in our backyard, and we're working on squirrel recipes.

1124
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,230
Some people think that's low class, but hey, there's a lot of squirrels around.

1125
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,710
Did you ever dress up a sheep like, you know, like with a miniskirt and a pair of sunglasses

1126
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,950
and stuff, that kind of shoot you a girl look, you know?

1127
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,150
That's pretty good.

1128
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:02,470
Yeah.

1129
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,670
It's mighty, mighty good eating.

1130
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,170
I think I just missed something.

1131
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,150
Were you talking about grandma-faced sandwich?

1132
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,210
Well, that's a way of putting it.

1133
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,290
Floridians call it cooter pie.

1134
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,330
Oh, turtle soup.

1135
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:17,730
Yeah.

1136
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:18,290
Yeah.

1137
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,250
Not turtle soup.

1138
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:19,790
Cooters.

1139
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:20,670
Conch.

1140
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,310
Oh, my ears are bleeding again.

1141
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,390
Is that a demonic thing, or is that from the show?

1142
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,310
It's my tinnitus.

1143
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,530
It's contagious.

1144
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,430
Perfectly.

1145
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:33,870
It's normal.

1146
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,070
Man.

1147
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,610
Bleeding out the ears could be a sign that you've been up.

1148
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,510
I hope you listeners heard that.

1149
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,790
My tinnitus is contagious.

1150
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,570
Tinnitus is a hearing disease.

1151
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,770
Maybe that came from Lagoon.

1152
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,490
Now, take a good look at my youth years of being a DJ.

1153
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:55,130
Hey, Stang, how was your hearing before that starter pistol got fired at your head?

1154
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:55,430
Yeah.

1155
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,790
There you go.

1156
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,170
I think it was that Hendrix concert when I was 15.

1157
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,510
I still have it from the Devo show I saw three weeks ago.

1158
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1159
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1160
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1161
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1162
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1163
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,510


1164
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,110
My ears are still ringing.

1165
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,550
Oh, they'll always ring then.

1166
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,670
In my case it sounds like crickets and cicadas.

1167
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:20,330
As a person who's tried to commit suicide and missed numerous times, the sound of the

1168
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,610
gun going off like less than two feet from your head will give you tinnitus, tinnitus,

1169
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,750
tinnitus, tinnitus, tinnitus.

1170
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:26,950
Yeah.

1171
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,130
Your ears will ring for a real long time.

1172
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,130
You'll think somebody's calling you at all hours.

1173
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:31,810
Right.

1174
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,030
Who is that?

1175
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,490
Who's that?

1176
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,370
Who's that?

1177
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,510
It's the sound of your shell dripping of the water.

1178
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:49,670
No, it's the sound of the hour of slack stolen from Radio Synesthesia with Dr. Sinister, Lucifer

1179
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:55,850
Convolute Dave, and caller Dr. Agon, all of them members of the Church of the Subgenius.

1180
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:01,630
And if you want to know infinitely more about the church and its funny books and movie shows

1181
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:08,790
and so on, and X Day in New York on July 5th, then you could check subgenius.com or write

1182
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,070
to P.O.

1183
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:17,130
Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1184
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,670
Now we will join Philo in the Movie Stars Graveyard.

1185
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,230
The Movie Stars, and it's right there.

1186
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,670
It's on this beautiful, it's a graveyard that's on a bluff that overlooks the ocean.

1187
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,790
These dead people have the greatest view you would imagine.

1188
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:36,150
You can just, it's beautiful just to walk around there and look at these beautiful buildings

1189
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,230
and then see this gorgeous view that normally only dead people get to enjoy.

1190
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:45,230
What you can see in a metaphorical sense.

1191
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,770
Oh, like in the Disney ride with little heads that turn in.

1192
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,270
Hey, do we have to say something now?

1193
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,610
It's like my watch, there's an alarm going off now.

1194
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:56,890
What?

1195
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,430
Mistakenly.

1196
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,410
Or time going by.

1197
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,470
It's time going by quick.

1198
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:07,710
And now a quick respite with the psycho-skeletons, or skeleton in this case, playing the bass

1199
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,690
parts of the Jimi Hendrix classic, Power of Soul.

1200
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:43,270
And now we are in the movie stars' graveyard.

1201
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,170
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.

1202
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,670
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.

1203
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:56,310
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.

1204
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:00,470
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.

1205
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:09,090
Thank you, psycho-skeletons.

1206
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:14,010
Now back to Puzzling Evidence talking about Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.

1207
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,770
Praise Bob.

1208
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,090
How was the music to that one?

1209
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,790
It's coming up right now.

1210
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,790
And you know, that's my favorite subgenius movie because that's how I imagine Bob.

1211
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,610
Ah, well.

1212
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,910
That's exactly how I see Bob.

1213
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:30,630
There's a scene at the end where they finally break into the big chamber and they find Bob

1214
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,670
and he's all desiccated.

1215
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,830
He's a withered mummy.

1216
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,430
That's how you see Bob?

1217
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,030
Well, I see him, he starts the doomsday machine and then you find out he's been dead for 18 years.

1218
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,370
He's just a withered mummy sitting there.

1219
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,930
And there's a little note in his hand saying, I'm sorry.

1220
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,250
And the rocket's going .

1221
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,530
It's like, oh man.

1222
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,830
I gotta watch that again.

1223
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,210
I haven't seen that in so long.

1224
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,810
I think I'd like to watch it again.

1225
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,550
And he got me at the 20,000 robots coming down Broadway.

1226
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:55,890
You know what I mean?

1227
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,750
Oh, I loved it.

1228
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:02,810
In fact, I think what happened is that I had trouble with it because I was so infatuated

1229
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,730
with the way it looked, I couldn't even keep up with the storyline.

1230
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:10,670
When a Broadway baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning.

1231
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,450
That was that music was from when she just pulls the cord in the future plane and you

1232
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:14,990
can go underwater.

1233
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:16,290
Oh yeah.

1234
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,490
Up until the building.

1235
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,330
I want six of those.

1236
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:19,970
No kidding.

1237
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:21,970
Man, this skit.

1238
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,110
Oh, now that we're getting a number of calls here.

1239
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:30,570
We're trying to ride herd on this crisis as it erupts.

1240
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:36,250
And here in the studio with Dr. Philo Drummond and other top flight newscasters, we will

1241
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,430
be bringing the story to you as it happens.

1242
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:45,130
Late breaking news suggests that this is the most momentous tale to have toddled down the

1243
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,930
turf in many a myrmidons mood.

1244
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:55,090
And now for a complete uptick on the upchuck and bull roar, I lead you by the nose, by

1245
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,090
the mouth, by the tongue.

1246
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:56,970
I am Dr. Philo Drummond.

1247
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,290
Yes, thank you.

1248
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:58,650
Thank you.

1249
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:08,050
And I have this announcement that in 2010, a space odyssey, there were more than 1,355,000,

1250
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,370
give or take 1000 monoliths on the surface of Jupiter.

1251
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,750
In other news, we found out that only humans and horses have diamonds.

1252
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,850
Like the dead Frank pool shows up.

1253
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,430
Yeah.

1254
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,310
This just in.

1255
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,850
In Eastern Africa, you can buy banana beer.

1256
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,710
This beer is brewed from bananas.

1257
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,470
Give me two.

1258
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,610
The old English word for sneeze is fiosen.

1259
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:36,870
Fiosen.

1260
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,510
I think we need three over here.

1261
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,490
And now, St. Stephen is the patron saint of bricklayers.

1262
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,650
Gosh, look at that.

1263
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,950
Tomorrow, children are poisoned most frequently by eating harmful plants.

1264
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,290
Did you know in 1980, the city of Detroit presented Sedanum Prod.

1265
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:54,290


1266
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,910
You know that yourself?

1267
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:59,810
A typical Muslim is Athena that changes the way they think.

1268
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,390
Yes, but how does this happen, Buddha?

1269
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,610
It's the relationship-

1270
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:04,610


1271
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:04,610


1272
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:04,750
It might be true.

1273
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,050
... But, and a divine cause officially still living today in the distant past.

1274
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,170
This is cute.

1275
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,270
Yes.

1276
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:24,150
We're not breathing, theieu'atu, Elena.

1277
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,150


1278
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,150


1279
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,150


1280
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,150


1281
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,210
Doesn't matter.

1282
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,110
from the federal to the state level.

1283
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:27,850
Woo.

1284
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:28,930
Woo.

1285
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,030
Woo.

1286
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:30,570
Woo.

1287
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:30,970
Woo.

1288
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,170
Dot com.

1289
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,310
Great place for information on what's happening in the cult.

1290
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:34,490
Cult.

1291
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:34,710
Cult.

1292
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:34,870
Cult.

1293
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,510
Talk about.

1294
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:35,770
Love.

1295
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,310
Talk about.

1296
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:36,570
Love.

1297
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:37,010
Love that.

1298
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,270
We've got some good head.

1299
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:38,570
Good head.

1300
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:38,870
Good head.

1301
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:39,290
Every day.

1302
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:39,730
Every day.

1303
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,370
Kills.

1304
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:40,750
Kills.

1305
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,010
K.

1306
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:41,210
K.

1307
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:41,450
K.

1308
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:41,630
G.

1309
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:41,890
B.

1310
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,770
Welcome to the program.

1311
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:43,210
Program.

1312
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:43,710
Program.

1313
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:44,170
Program.

1314
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:44,550
Not.

1315
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:44,830
Not.

1316
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:45,630
I'm thrilled, man.

1317
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,670
People are wanting to get engaged.

1318
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:47,630
They want to get engaged.

1319
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,210
They want to.

1320
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,410
Cult.

1321
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:48,610
Cult.

1322
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,050
Give it up.

1323
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,490
Give it up.

1324
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:49,990
It's all over.

1325
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,170
Believe everything you read.

1326
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:51,710
Million.

1327
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:52,290
Take it.

1328
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:52,550
Take it.

1329
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:52,790
We got.

1330
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:53,270
Like.

1331
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,090
Move the cult.

1332
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,290
Yeah.

1333
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:54,430
Okay.

1334
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:54,950
I'll tell you what.

1335
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,150
So you're talking.

1336
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:56,550
Talking.

1337
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,470
That's a cult.

1338
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:57,830
I'd say.

1339
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,070
Flat ambivalent.

1340
00:57:59,090 --> 00:57:59,490
No kidding.

1341
00:57:59,550 --> 00:57:59,830
You know.

1342
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,130
You know.

1343
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:00,750
Look at history.

1344
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,530
Huge impact.

1345
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,790
Yep.

1346
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:02,230
Yep.

1347
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:02,310
Yep.

1348
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:02,830
Moving the cult.

1349
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:03,310
Moving the cult.

1350
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:03,990
Ain't gonna happen.

1351
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:04,590
Ain't gonna happen.

1352
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,370
Ain't gonna happen.

1353
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:05,890
Ain't gonna happen.

1354
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:06,750
Ain't gonna happen.

1355
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,390
No, no, no.

1356
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:07,950
I love it.

1357
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:08,630
Inch by inch.

1358
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,890
Yeah.

1359
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,090
Movement.

1360
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,730
Well, we're doing abortion.

1361
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:11,390
That's right.

1362
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:11,850
All right.

1363
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:19,810
I'm sure.

1364
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,590
No, no, no.

1365
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:20,950
No, no, no.

1366
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:21,470
That's a lie.

1367
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,070
That's a lie.

1368
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,450
Baby.

1369
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:22,930
Baby.

1370
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:23,870
Hands on experience.

1371
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:24,730
Find out more.

1372
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,490
I love it.

1373
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:25,930
I love it.

1374
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,450
Fetus right.

1375
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,170
Stuff like this.

1376
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,490
You know.

1377
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,870
You know.

1378
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:28,930
I'm not pro-life.

1379
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:29,890
So we're very excited.

1380
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,010
To send me to Iraq.

1381
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:32,710
And I'm gone.

1382
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,150
It's exciting.

1383
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,070
Energize.

1384
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:35,670
Have abortion.

1385
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,090
That's actually helped us.

1386
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,090
We've seen an explosion.

1387
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,150
This is meaningful.

1388
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,930
These men think you know where Toledo is.

1389
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:09,790
You've got to tell them.

1390
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,170
They can't make me talk.

1391
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:12,210
Norma.

1392
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,310
Do you know where Toledo is?

1393
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:13,850
Yes.

1394
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:14,970
Is that the truth?

1395
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:15,290
No.

1396
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,750
How can I reason with you?

1397
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,010
Now loading on track two.

1398
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,010
Four.

1399
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,590
Yeah.

1400
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:25,830
Toledo.

1401
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,330
Huh?

1402
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,410
Toledo.

1403
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,310
You can count on Toledo.

1404
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,150
Not anymore.

1405
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,010
What?

1406
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,250
So long.

1407
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,070
So long, Toledo.
