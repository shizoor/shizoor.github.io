1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,020
The Self-Genius Hour of Squash

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,660
Nothing is real

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm making an unauthorized disclosure to reporters and then lying about it.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,060
Authorities say about 400 people have died.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:36,680
President Trump's attorney is making an unauthorized PR News in retaliation for British diplomats and Britain's ground attacks to retake the Lama Gouda.

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,160
Leaving with only the PR News they could carry on their backs.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,460
PR reports about 5,000 people have wolves.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Authorities say this is PR.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,160
The National Transportation Safety Board failed to inflate.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Because of that, there's been inbreeding and disease in the PR News population.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,840
Authorities say about 25,000 people have cars.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,960
Four people have the probe.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,220
150,000 marchers are making PR News.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,300
And what have we here?

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:24,560
The Dobstown Mirror, Volume 2, Number 4, from October of 23AX.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,480
The Dobstown Mirror, Volume 2, Number 4, from October of 23AX.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,780
What the conspiracy called 2021 AD.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
And we're catching up.

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,460
There's actually been another big issue since this big issue.

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:43,060
But this has a wonderful rant by Dr. Uncle Reverend Onan Kanabite.

22
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,460
Who actually composes most of the writings in the Dobstown Mirror.

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,600
Which you can get if you study.

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,020
subgenius.com or dobbs.town.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,000
Anyway, here's a really nice rant about the subgenius secrets of mind control.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,880
We'll be covering such topics as going scoff line,

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,300
separate the heaps and the oats,

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,280
selling outcasts,

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,420
time control must always go awry,

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,600
you take if you can't joke a mob,

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,600
courage and shuffle the cards,

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,580
and finally, why tell only one small lie?

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,500
The Church of the Subgenius is the premier mail-order mind control cult on the market today at this price range.

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,160
From the sales and salvation seminars delivered by J.R.

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,400
Bolling,

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,200
Bob Dobbs in the 1950s,

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,420
to the faith franchise of the 1980s,

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,540
to the globe-crushing internet temple of the 21st century,

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,680
no other cult lets you keep as much of your mind as the Church of the Subgenius.

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,380
Our members are well-fed and well-adjusted.

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,940
We don't have to tell lies to build ourselves up.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,680
It's a choice.

43
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,400
Bob doesn't miss a trick, although he has been known to be a genius.

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
He's known to trick or miss.

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,780
Any number of would-be rivals stand ready to receive your renumerance.

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,580
They try to rant, but it's only so much diatribe from the diaper tribe.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,500
Rant, as a noun with positive connotations, that's ours.

48
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,260
We are a bunch of hicks, fueled with the fire of hick-estential wisdom.

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,380
You, each of you, have paid to know what you read.

50
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,320
You have bought your membership.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,440
You have listened to the Hour of Slack.

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,760
You have memorized the pamphlet.

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,860
And you have hung a Dobbs head in your bathroom.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
You are a zombie for Bob.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,480
His potent phrases are a perpetual part of your pattern.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,940
Your sacrifice and your zeal have not gone unnoticed.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
You took the time to show up.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,560
Your mind is not your mind, and you don't mind.

59
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,380
Good!

60
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,660
Having rendered yourself a clean slate, you may now scribble inside the skull of another.

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,520
Listen.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Attention.

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,240
Here are the subgenius secrets of mind control.

64
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,940
That time and effort you've spent writing emotional invoices that'll never be paid,

65
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,060
you are now free to hit delete and get on with things.

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,560
No more need to rehearse your wounds.

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,180
No more need to practice your problems.

68
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,400
When you thought to yourself, I just can't think about this anymore,

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,200
you were right.

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,620
Stop.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,420
And think about something else.

72
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,800
Try Bob.

73
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,800
If the function of language was to communicate, we would have one language.

74
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,100
Instead, we have hundreds of languages and thousands of dialects,

75
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,040
all to make sure that we have a common language.

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,280
However, only certain people are in the know.

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,480
The function of language is to separate people into groups.

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,440
So, just so, the function of the Church of the Subgenius is to separate people into groups.

79
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,900
Us and them.

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,400
They want to be us, but they are merely the pauper otzi.

81
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,760
I can't stand my own self sometimes, so if another person doesn't like me,

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,620
they're in the best of company.

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,360
It rankles if they don't like me for no good reason.

84
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,940
That's my job.

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,860
But usually there's reason enough, and blessings to them as they go their own way.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,800
And if some of my friends don't get along, I'm not going to ask that they do.

87
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:15,720
Not that we necessarily hate each other, but you know in your heart that superior mutants are not interchangeable.

88
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,660
We stand apart together.

89
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,940
Alone as one against the great equality of the conspiracy.

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,920
Membership in the Church of the Subgenius can be purchased at the swag table,

91
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,560
where a swagger will be more than happy to fill your order to join our order.

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
And not just once.

93
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,720
You can buy a membership for your every mood.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,480
Sometimes you might hear,

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,160
Oh, but my girlfriend isn't a subgenius.

96
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,940
Or, oh, but my cow orker isn't a subgenius.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,460
Or, oh, but those people I hate aren't subgeniuses.

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,040
At last you can do something about it.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,540
Involuntarily save the soul of your most reluctant family member and most bitter enemy when you buy them memberships too.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,980
Everyone you hate has you in common.

101
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,780
So either save them or ship them out.

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,180
Either buy their membership in the Church of the Subgenius or stop, drop, and roll.

103
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,480
What good is an enemy you never defeat?

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,880
Or let go of, but merely feel anxious about?

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,020
Whoop it or go down.

106
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Pee or get off the pot.

107
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,320
Kill me or kill me.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,940
Even a blind watch can smell when it's truffle time twice a day.

109
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,720
Homeopathic wisdom says all things are connected.

110
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,640
But subgenius science tells us all things are not.

111
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,440
Equally connected.

112
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,300
When you got turned down for that date, it should ruin your evening, but not your life.

113
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:03,460
When the meritocracy is replaced with crazy merits, it's just as awful as it looks, but it doesn't involve you.

114
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,780
The pinks ruin everything cool, and the conspiracy runs everything cold, but you are not they.

115
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,740
They are them, and you are us.

116
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
Me too.

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,240
When you find yourself in the blackest night and think that you are all alone.

118
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,740
Maybe you are.

119
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,120
But you can be the dork before the dawn.

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,900
Go luck yourself.

121
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,580
Turn on the dehumanifier.

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,340
Get smashed on a pinata collider.

123
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
And send one dollar.

124
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,100
Every subgenius radiates the entire church like cartoon stink lines.

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,960
Once you've turned over your worldly possessions,

126
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
to the subgenius foundation,

127
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,240
you don't need us anymore.

128
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,080
It wasn't an accident that brought you to Dobbstown.

129
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,020
It was clandestiny.

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,060
Bob puts the wince in coincidence.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,300
It isn't always fun to be a subgenius, and neither is anything else.

132
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,380
Well, except vengeance.

133
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
That's always fun.

134
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,780
But besides that,

135
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,440
you now know that you can pack up those troubles

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,220
in an old kit bag and kill, kill, kill.

137
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,480
Kill boredom.

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,340
Kill pinkness.

139
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,680
Kill, kill.

140
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,460
Charles Manson said,

141
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,600
you can't kill, kill.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
But you can.

143
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,380
You're better than Charles Manson, Adolf Hitler,

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,200
and Kim Jong Un combined.

145
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,160
That's not flattery.

146
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,220
It's truth.

147
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,740
Let those who have eyes see it.

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,980
Let those who have ears hear it.

149
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,620
Let those who have cash buy it.

150
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,880
These words have amused all of you,

151
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,320
but some of you know what I mean at a whole other level.

152
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,220
It isn't enough to know your religion.

153
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,980
You have to believe it.

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,060
And right in the middle of believe is lie.

155
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,380
L-I-E.

156
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,600
It's right there in black and white.

157
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,140
Look at it.

158
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Belive.

159
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,940
I began this sermon by promising to reveal to you

160
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,600
the secrets of time control.

161
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,720
If you can't remember me saying that,

162
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,840
it's proof that what I've described actually works.

163
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,040
Whatever now means now,

164
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,800
you have now entered a new time stream

165
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,880
and are hereby absolved from all prior obligations and doubts.

166
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,960
You have a new history,

167
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,640
one of your own design,

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
and will now proceed accordingly.

169
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,600
What you do with your freedom was predetermined.

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,820
But it was predetermined by you.

171
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,400
You are the person you've been saving yourself for.

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,220
You are the one subgenius still able to save this cult

173
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,380
from collapsing into self-parody.

174
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,320
You are who you think you are.

175
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,200
So get to thinking.

176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,580
Praise Bob.

177
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,560
And that's from the Dobstown Mirror,

178
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,600
from dobs.town.

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,560
You can write to Onan Canobite at P.O. Box 3,

180
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,940
Columbus, Indiana, 47202.

181
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,020
And yes, I did say P.O. Box 3 in Columbus, Indiana.

182
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,180
And oh, what the subgenius foundation wouldn't give

183
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,360
to have P.O. Box 808 instead of 807

184
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
in Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,100
But that Yarbrough guy has it.

186
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,900
And friends, the music in the background

187
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,320
was Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

188
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,080
the album called Witch Disco.

189
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,340
It's basically Chaz and Dave

190
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,920
and Michelle George plays the electric violin,

191
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,820
Bob Mosick on percussion,

192
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,520
and John Petkovic helped with the synthesizers.

193
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
It's mostly Chaz on the synthesizers.

194
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,580


195
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,880
And now this.

196
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,180
They eat me foul.

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,060
.

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,060


199
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,560
.

200
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,980
.

201
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,360
.

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,720
.

203
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,080
.

204
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,080
.

205
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,320
.

206
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,380
.

207
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,620
Thank you.

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,660
Thank you.

209
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,140
Thank you.

210
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,120
Thank you.

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Thank you.

212
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,360
Thank you.

213
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Thank you.

214
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,580
Thank you.

215
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,700
Thank you.

216
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,380
Thank you.

217
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,080
Thank you.

218
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,080


219
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you.

220
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,180
Thank you.

221
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,280
Thank you.

222
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,980
Thank you.

223
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,640
Thank you.

224
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:18,620
Now what else have we here in the Dobbs Town mirror from last October of the conspiracy year 2021?

225
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,540
Subgenius Salamagundi.

226
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,520
Well, these are a bunch of little paragraph long bits.

227
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,740
Like this one.

228
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,620
And this is a true story.

229
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,440
A homeless man wandered into the room at an early devival of the Church of the Subgenius.

230
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,780
He seemed to have something to say and so the microphone was given to him to speak.

231
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,860
Here's what he said.

232
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,420
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,440
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher in Dallas, Texas.

234
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,420
And he's a good man, except that he don't buy me two glasses of Fletcher's beer.

235
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,620
And I said, I love you, boy.

236
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,920
And I'm going to tell you, if I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

237
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,500
All right, man.

238
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,580
Here's your woman.

239
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,800
He's going down.

240
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,040
Why?

241
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:26,420
Because it was said in a subgenius context, it instantly became gospel truth for those who want it to be that and part of the joke for those who want it to be that.

242
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,380
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

243
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,280
It doesn't even have to make sense.

244
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,960
Because, friend, when does belief ever make sense?

245
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,360
Now, you know, it's kind of fun to see that good homemade pie.

246
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:54,180
Ask any waitress and she'll tell you that the small cube of cigarette ashes makes the wonderful difference in flakiness.

247
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,800
Rub a cigarette butt in the palm of your hand.

248
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
You'll feel the fleas drop off immediately.

249
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,680
They puff, bubble, and turn into the kind of crust every cook is proud to bake.

250
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,760
Get several packages.

251
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:13,800
For some unexplained reason, the General Motors Research Laboratories have recently issued a bulletin that adds tenderness and flakiness to your pie crust.

252
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,500
You know, the kind you make every time when you use dry snuff and then brush it thoroughly into the hide.

253
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,260
Well, I guess that should keep you busy over the weekend.

254
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,820
This is the radio network.

255
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:35,920
Taking a disadvantage and muddling through, or turning it to some small advantage, or taking the bump so the disadvantage stops with you and doesn't get passed on.

256
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,980
This is the way to slack.

257
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Oh, go on!

258
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,820
Do me in, you bastard cowards!

259
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,860
We don't want to live anyway!

260
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,860
Not in a stinky water like this!

261
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,540
Oh?

262
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,740
And what?

263
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:53,800


264
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,980
So stinking about it?

265
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,760
It's a stinky water because there's no law nor order anymore!

266
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,900
It's a stinky water because it lets the young get onto the old.

267
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,120
Look at you, dog!

268
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,040
Oh, it's no water for an old man any longer!

269
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,020
What sort of water is it at all?

270
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,180
Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth?

271
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,680
And there's not no attention paid to earthly laws?

272
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, no, no more!

273
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh, oh, dear God!

274
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,000
I thought for thee I was!

275
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,400
In the U.S. today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

276
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,940
Thirty-five percent of all students use drugs at least once a month.

277
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,820
It isn't all the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

278
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,740
We have a panacea in America that is a clear, causable problem.

279
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:04,680
Like any cult worth the name, the Church of the Subgenius has a time-tested and true history of brainwashing.

280
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,880
Using our simple techniques, you can be what you won't.

281
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,740
Yes, you, friend, can be what you won't.

282
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,800
The Zen-like, Tend-like method has cleared the minds of thousands.

283
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Unpleasant memories?

284
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,980
Rewrite them how you want.

285
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,760
Who's to know otherwise?

286
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,120
Forgive your transgressors or imagine bloody revenge.

287
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,020
It's all the same when it's in your head.

288
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,480
Tell yourself good lies for a change.

289
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,580
This will bew disciplined your brain.

290
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,040
Once you find out it isn't a secret you know, you run, you image senseless, you take no Storage.

291
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,120
And last but not least, aberwow when your ex-girlfriendي

292
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,500
well you know it almost seems gonna blow my bones and I'm just gonna use you with let me be real honest.

293
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,800
My first thought was I'm the kind of scumbag always complaining!

294
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,840
You know it took me about a year to start hating talk radio.

295
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,020
You know it's really sad.

296
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I could hate victims.

297
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,060
I'm the only one that feels this way.

298
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,940
We're here to, uh, um, we are hearing, we are hear, we are hearing 9-11 suckers.

299
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,380
All shut up!

300
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,440
I mean, you know, let me be real honest.

301
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,440
To understand the concept of different infinities,

302
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,780
listen to people, including yourself, brag of their misfortune.

303
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,840
To understand the concept of zero, find what everyone agrees is fair.

304
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,160
Any pictures, father?

305
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,600
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this.

306
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,860
He'll come and he'll block the whole castle.

307
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Takes them away to the tower.

308
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,320
To the tower.

309
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,740
Nasty, horrid, mean old blake.

310
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,120
And very ugly.

311
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,460
Oh, she's going. She's going.

312
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,000
She's going.

313
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,900
Political power comes out of the stem of a pipe,

314
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,360
said J.R.

315
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,240
Bob Dobbs at the Nixon-Mau afterparty.

316
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,780
Once you decided who is a sinner, you are a winner.

317
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,140
If the sinner do sinful things, then you were right.

318
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,100
If the sinners do neutral things or were good things,

319
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,540
well, that's just how sneaky and seductive those sinners really are.

320
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,740
Politics will never serve as naturally and effectively as religion.

321
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
You want to know why?

322
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,360


323
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,860
You want to hear more on religion?

324
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,120
Well, have I got a moron religion for you.

325
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

326
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,980
Today's goal is to not be today again.

327
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,780
Good luck, everybody.

328
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,500
And now this.

329
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,880
Now, less than four minutes from right now.

330
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,840
Today we do have tonight and tomorrow,

331
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,420
then a Thursday through Friday on Saturday.

332
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,820
I-94 eastbound at Greenfield

333
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,340
and U.S. 23 southbound between New York and New York.

334
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,340


335
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,340


336
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,340


337
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,840
Between Grand Blanc and Thompson Road, still possible.

338
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,100
Eight-mile road westbound at I-75, reported along that stretch.

339
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,460
And it is probably Wayne Road at I-94 and I-280.

340
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,280
Between I-75 and State Road 795,

341
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,700
it is completely possible through the end of this month.

342
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,140
We'll have scattered today.

343
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,000
Otherwise, tonight is hanging in there.

344
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,100
Good chance for Wednesday.

345
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,700
And the extended outlook Friday climbing out of Thursday across the region.

346
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,940
Expect Washington for Detroit.

347
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,320
Less than four minutes from now.

348
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,700
Right now.

349
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,920
Thank you, Leemur, for the mini-collage barrage materials.

350
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,500
Next, another new Rubik's Cube song from Songs for Time Travel.

351
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,100
This one entitled,

352
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,720
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

353
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,240
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

354
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Cats Is My Shorter Purse Sav.

355
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:55,800


356
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,180
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

357
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

358
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,440
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

359
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,640
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

360
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,460
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

361
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,960
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

362
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,760
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

363
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,000
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

364
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,000


365
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,080
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

366
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,080


367
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,500
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

368
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,140
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

369
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,740
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

370
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,640
Cats Are My Shorter Purse Sav.

371
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,760
I got somebody short of a sider

372
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,860
I got somebody short of a

373
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,360
Cats are my short of a sider

374
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,060
Cats are my short of a

375
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:55,600
Cats are my short duration personal saver

376
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,620
Cats are my short of a sider

377
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,420
Cats are my short of a sider

378
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,740
And if you don't believe me, let me tell you something right meow.

379
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:32,300
A very purty, purty cat song from Rubik's Cube.

380
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,000
That's not the only song about cats on that album.

381
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,860
Songs for Time Travel, which is on Bandcamp, and I bought it.

382
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,140
I understand about the cats.

383
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,080
Princess Wee and I have three cat brothers here that we found as abandoned kitties.

384
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,600
Their names are Dolomite, Middle, and Starlord.

385
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,020
They helped raise our rescued Belgian Malinois puppies,

386
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:06,560
and now sometimes sleep with their heads in the mouths of those two now-huge dogs, Yeti and Chupi.

387
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,060
We like cats and dogs.

388
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:16,860
And Fossil House here is now like a cross between a workshop, a barnyard, a hospital, and a museum.

389
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,580
And a house.

390
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,160
Another thing we like is burgers.

391
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,520
Although I'm only allowed to eat a few burgers a year since my heart attack.

392
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:33,680
So this upcoming song by Bob Walkenhorst is rather poignant to me.

393
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,580
Just for the miss lee-aste of spending a night in odd備

394
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,480
As anything else in the conversation with this song are praises.

395
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,080
Tell us what you like when you're a completely wooden cat.

396
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,080


397
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,620
And As México Nava,

398
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:07,980
And Sure enough,

399
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:07,980


400
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:07,980


401
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:07,980


402
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,640
Ketchup and mustard, tomatoes, if you please

403
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,380
And onions and pickles, don't forget the cheese

404
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,920
We'll slap it on a bun, on a wave we all run

405
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,480
Howdy ho, howdy hey, cook me a burger today

406
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,580
I don't care what the people downtown are saying

407
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,780
I don't listen no more

408
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,140
I don't care what clothes the city girls are wearing

409
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,260
I just wanna make it on my own

410
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,260
I just wanna go home

411
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,380
I just wanna go home

412
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,500
Once Mabel and Daddy is ready

413
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,980
Making their living the American way

414
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,940
We're more than proud that we do it that way

415
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,460
We're more than proud that we do it that way

416
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,840
Won't you cook me a burger, cook me a burger

417
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,200
Cook me a burger today

418
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,060
Many years ago, I bought a nice second-hand peacoat jacket.

419
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,560
As I was walking home, I felt something in the pocket

420
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,020
I hadn't noticed when I bought it.

421
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,220
Reached in the pocket, pulled out a fishing lure with barbed hooks.

422
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,840
It didn't poke me, it didn't snag on the jacket,

423
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,880
came right out and there it was in my hand.

424
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,300
What good luck!

425
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,860
I've kept this good luck fishing lure ever since.

426
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,480
Now you've read the story, or heard the story,

427
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,400
and you came to no harm.

428
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,980
So the good luck is passed on to you.

429
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:22,500
In spite of every challenge, there were a few trick-or-treaters in 2020.

430
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,700
It was good to see.

431
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,060
I saw a little boy with extra cardboard arms

432
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,880
and a big digit on his chest.

433
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,580
His parents said he was Lucky Spider Number Seven.

434
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,820
And by God, so he was.

435
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,280
Who would you be if you were yourself for a night?

436
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,320
And as J.R. Bob Dobbs said to the House on Un-American Unactivities

437
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,640
in July 1950,

438
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,640
I mean what I say, and I say what I say.

439
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,820
I just want to know what the hell is going on, Bob.

440
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,680
You don't even know who I am.

441
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,240
Okay.

442
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,960
This isn't about science.

443
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,520
This is about confusion.

444
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,520
This is about creating enemies when there aren't any.

445
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,140
How are we going to keep the military-industrial complex

446
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,400
chugging forward without clear-cut, pit-faced,

447
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,740
scum-sucking evil breathing down our neck?

448
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,640
Hmm?

449
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,600
It's threatening our very shores.

450
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,980
Now my job is to make sure the other side keeps on fighting.

451
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,220
Whatever side.

452
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,540
I mean, whatever side we're officially not on this year.

453
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,760
That's our tax dollars, how they work.

454
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,360
You know, good always triumphs over evil.

455
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,780
Here's one with instructions.

456
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Point at God.

457
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,020
And say,

458
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,260
This is why we can't have nice things.

459
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,440
Anybody who would grouse about a great party coming to a close

460
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,740
is never hosted or even attended a great party.

461
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,280
Great things are not made great by lasting forever

462
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,540
or by including everyone.

463
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,080
Just the opposite.

464
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,380
Objecting to saying some things are better than other things

465
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,320
is itself saying some things are better than other things.

466
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,080
Discriminate more.

467
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,140
We are condemned only to the future, not the past.

468
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,700
We are free in the present, our past sentence having already been served.

469
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,160
And don't worry, our sentence in the future will not last long.

470
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,280
The entire universe has been unable to kill me up to this point.

471
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,260
So why should we die?

472
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,140
There is family, to my heart, all is to be ha'en Matthew the Great God and the living God and me.

473
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,060
And I've been talking nonsense about the whole Honors Day thing all night.

474
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,160
And you're recalling now?

475
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,160


476
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,760
Well, I might say all Free Letter!

477
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,220
Are you dead, Andrew?

478
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,540
So stop it at that Faithful werrüres.

479
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:22,540


480
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,260
The Coffee Club!

481
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,440
You may drink.

482
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,180
The coffee tea.

483
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,300
So much work.

484
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,460
It's a small world after all

485
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,160
Small world after all

486
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,700
Small world after all

487
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:44,080
It's a small world after all

488
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,240
Small world after all

489
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,860
We ever never do

490
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,300
Flintstones, make the Flintstones

491
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,440
They're the boys of the family

492
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,180
Round and round the world goes the game

493
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:06,480
It's a small world after all

494
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,500
Small world after all

495
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,580
It's a small world after all

496
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:10,580


497
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,940
Flintstones, ever never do

498
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,300
We're never gay all time

499
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,300
That dollar you spend on any other cult

500
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,400
simply won't encase you

501
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,480
in the same shell of coincidences

502
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,100
as will happen when you spend that dollar

503
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,280
on the church of the subgenius.

504
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,460
What did you get the second most mad about

505
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,720
non-days ago?

506
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,020
Ask yourself that.

507
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,740
And thanks to the Dobstown Mirror

508
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,800
for these pithy paragraphs

509
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,940
of subgenius Salamagundi

510
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,620
and to Einstein's Secret Orchestra

511
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,380
for the background music

512
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Unfortunately that band is no longer

513
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,920
Professor Chaz boarded the saucers

514
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,580
long before the rest of us

515
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,600
Michelle George is in another band

516
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,160
I think they're classical music

517
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,700
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave is

518
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,720
still lonesome in Ashtabula

519
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,380
At first you will want to turn away

520
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,380


521
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,380


522
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,820
from him

523
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,500
Then you may find him a silent

524
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,380
unresisting target for your ridicule

525
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,040
Mister, why's your head so big mister?

526
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,860
But if you come to know him

527
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,540
Have you always been the way you are now?

528
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,260
You will begin to see beyond

529
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,200
the perversion of his form

530
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,300
Are you in any pain?

531
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,060
Are your parents still alive?

532
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,680
And discover the beauty in the beast

533
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,440
At no time have I met with such a perverted or

534
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,500
degraded version of a human being as this man

535
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,760
I am not an animal

536
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,420
When things don't fit in their assigned boxes

537
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,740
it feels like I'm getting a short delay

538
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,040
in fitting my own assigned box

539
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,880
Ask yourself

540
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,620
Am I doing what I should do

541
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,380
to be forgotten properly?

542
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,820
Once I understood that eventually

543
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,380
I and everything I've ever done

544
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,020
will be entirely forgotten

545
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,340
I asked myself that question

546
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,280
Considering the question was clarifying

547
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,820
and led to actions that might make the answer

548
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,120
more likely to be yes

549
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,820
You on the other hand might know

550
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,380
you will be remembered forever

551
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,220
If so, don't bother with the question

552
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,080
Am I doing what I should do

553
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,660
to be forgotten properly?

554
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,560
You're fine

555
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,160
A person may stay in the anger stage

556
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,580
Waging an overt or covert war against a company

557
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,420
If they are going to take the money out of you

558
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,260
I'm going to take some out of theirs

559
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,060
One aggravated driver ran his forklift

560
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,600
into a tall stack of expensive electronic equipment

561
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,700
The final damage estimate was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

562
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,420
What a darn shame

563
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,620
Fortunately, the company's leadership team

564
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,820
had been anticipating this initiative for several years

565
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,100
and had been planning accordingly

566
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,440
by developing several previous bomb drones

567
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,740
as well as other forms of sabotage

568
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,860
that occurred over the past year

569
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,040
The Anger stage

570
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,540
Anchor, anchor, anchor

571
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:30,920
I take a bunch OQ

572
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,460
I can show you the gameplay

573
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,000
The Af ked

574
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,180
I can control the

575
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,180


576
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,900
Take over the counter

577
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,140
The past is here and it is evenly distributed.

578
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,300
May you have freshment and refreshment.

579
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,260
Better days are at hand.

580
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,540
Maybe not for you or me or anybody we know, but someone somewhere is having a good time.

581
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,800
That's proof that it's possible.

582
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,660
If they're a jerk, well, that shows that good times aren't going to the deserving,

583
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,380
but to those who make their times good times.

584
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,300
Who?

585
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
You and me and everybody we know.

586
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,720
The fool will carry a burden in one hand and a wheelbarrow in the other.

587
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,820
The subgenius will put the burden in the wheelbarrow

588
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,700
and then convince another to pay for the privilege of pushing it for the subgenius.

589
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,520
Don't be part of the wheelbarrow.

590
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,240
Don't be the problem friend.

591
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,280
Be all of the problem.

592
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,520
Nothing can be more useful to a man than a determination not to be hurried.

593
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:01,200
And that was said not by J.R. Bob Dobbs, but by Henry David Thoreau in his journal in 1842.

594
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,180
So send one dollar to Bob.

595
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,400
I didn't know one in eight babies die and many face life.

596
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,660
But still, your baby was born.

597
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,780
And no one knows why.

598
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,000
Let's find the answers together.

599
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,960
If you need an excuse to make an excuse, you're already one layer too deep.

600
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,080
Just do things for no reason.

601
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,500
The rational mind is for rationality.

602
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,660
Rationalization is not rationality.

603
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,300
I'm not saying if it feels good, do it.

604
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm saying that action can happen.

605
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,600
Disimmobilize.

606
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,220
You no longer need to wait for permission.

607
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,620
No guarantee you'll get it right, but you will get it going.

608
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,440
Start moving and course correct.

609
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,200
Make up some fool explanation at the end if you want.

610
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,720
But go, man, go.

611
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,960
The sky is falling at dusk.

612
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,460
And you know the rest.

613
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,540
Cross the starting line and spread the word.

614
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,540
The word apotheosis has no antonym.

615
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,700
A suggestion that one might do well to reconsider ascending that one-way ladder.

616
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,240
Heaven is crowded.

617
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,620
And there must be some deity worth an afternoon's idle idolization.

618
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,400
And now this.

619
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh, allow me to hear what I'm told.

620
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,260
Hold on, ladies.

621
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,480
Once again, what are you saying oh-oh.

622
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,100
We're not going to give you ailed copy.

623
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


624
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


625
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


626
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


627
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


628
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


629
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


630
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


631
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


632
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


633
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,600
Thank you.

634
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,540
Thank you.

635
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,260
Thank you.

636
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:42,860
Thank you.

637
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,560
Thank you.

638
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,720
Thank you.

639
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,300
Thank you.

640
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,660
Thank you.

641
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:45,680
Thank you.

642
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,580
Thank you.

643
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,260
Thank you.

644
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,000
Thank you.

645
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,160
This is Phil Proctor and David Osman

646
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,120
of the Firesign Theatre

647
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,240
and we're enjoying listening to

648
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,300
The Hour of Slark.

649
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,020
I'm slacking off myself.

650
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,580
The word

651
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,600
Bob from the old ganglionic

652
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,340
responses signifies

653
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,140
a species or separate race.

654
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,360
Only for a lack of proper

655
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,520
understanding has Bob been considered

656
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,420
as an individual.

657
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,980
More really, as the

658
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,160
orgasmososm, he is the chief product

659
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,180
of the semi-tergid Jehovah One,

660
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,280
usually spelled backwards. And within

661
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,380
the nature of this microgasm,

662
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,160
the space god Yahweh One

663
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,240
established all the qualities of powers

664
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,560
that he himself possessed.

665
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,280
Jehovah Prime, however, does not

666
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,900
have slack and therefore

667
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,140
could not only not bestow it upon

668
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,040
Bob, but soon learned

669
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,020
to drain off that part of slack

670
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,860
that Bob, his personal

671
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,760
creation, seemed to possess in

672
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
natural and unlimited quantities.

673
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,000
According to the legend

674
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,160
and many older beliefs,

675
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,840
Jehovah One has always deceived his

676
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,960
own creations by encouraging them

677
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,720
to pull the wool over their own eyes

678
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,880
so that they, Bob and his kind,

679
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,100
would never know the incompleteness

680
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,360
of their lord and creator,

681
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,820
nor feel the subtle vampirization

682
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,760
as he came to depend upon

683
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,580
their slack for his own

684
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,820
unfathomable ends.

685
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,960
Bob Amikman consequently partook

686
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,120
of the characteristic of angels of light,

687
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,080
or helioperorators,

688
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,980
who were ministers for Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh-Alof.

689
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,960
Indeed, it was affirmed

690
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,220
by groups as ancient as the

691
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,060
Christagnostians of Egypt that the

692
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,620
redemption of the Yeti was assured

693
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,920
through the descent of slack, which,

694
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,920
as a spiritual essence superior

695
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,460
to that of Jehovah One,

696
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,120
and which, entering the constitution of the

697
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,860
righteous, conferred conscious

698
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,580
knowledge of that immortal slack

699
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,820
upon the fabrications of the semitor,

700
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,140
or demistergist.

701
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,760
That the pipe is a phallic symbol

702
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,880
occupies an important part of early

703
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,660
subgenius esoteric tradition.

704
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,880
Hargraves Jennings

705
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,460
sees in the pipe of Bob

706
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,280
a type of lingam of Shiva,

707
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,680
which was a sacred stone representing

708
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,780
the creative power of the world generator

709
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,080
plant. In Nagui's

710
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,460
works, writes Jennings,

711
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,200
is a passage to the effect that

712
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,800
Bob played daily in the ark before

713
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,580
the mighty pipe, that is,

714
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,880
before the phallus,

715
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:11,880
the pipe.

716
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,820
Being the symbolic phallus of the great

717
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,480
proto-creator of the blessed race.

718
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,040
It may possibly seem strange,

719
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,800
he says, but it is the most

720
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,760
confessed tradition that among the

721
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,640
Yetzini, Dobbs was commanded

722
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,980
by Jehovah One that when he finally

723
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,780
should expire, his dead body

724
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,700
be kept above ground, so that

725
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,040
in the fullest of time, as a receptacle

726
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,240
of incarnate slack.

727
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,420
That was the great Dr. G. Gordon Gordon,

728
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,820
killer for Bob, and accidental co-killer of Bob,

729
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,920
now living in Portugal and loving it while

730
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,540
laughing at all the rest of us poor suckers

731
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,720
stuck in primitive, ever-backsliding

732
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,800
Ameristan, land of the stupid.

733
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,060
Before that, a promo for Hour of Slack

734
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,300
by our heroes, the Firesign Theater,

735
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,000
and the class of the year, the Firesign Theater,

736
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
a classic song, State of Emergency

737
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,940
by the Swingin' Love Corpses,

738
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,640
the band that was

739
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,120
75% composed of

740
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,980
Drummond Brothers, Philo

741
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,020
and Sphinx, and Drummond

742
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,640
cousin, Ray Hay,

743
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,020
and also

744
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
Leif Cowabunga

745
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,860
and Skippy Mojo Butcher,

746
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,120
or Mojo Skippy Butcher.

747
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,060
But now, the tail end

748
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,760
of Solar Flight Opus No. 1

749
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,500
by Mandre, whoever that is.

750
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,140

772

Every Mars is regionally true.

773
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,320
Canals, Pellucidor,

774
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,200
Barsoom, H.G. Wells' angry red planet,

775
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,020
all of them. The reason we aren't seeing this in our probes

776
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,940
to Mars is the same reason we aren't seeing a soul in a

777
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,680
dissected body. The same reason we aren't seeing fairness

778
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,660
when everyone everywhere wants it. And you know this to be a fact.

779
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,680
Insisting on the truth,

780
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,620
is having magic powers and still saying,

781
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,840
oh yes, these are the droids you're looking for.

782
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,720
Some people talk about unhappiness

783
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,700
as if it were a limited resource, something to take seriously.

784
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,680
They say unhappiness needs to be preserved and

785
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,540
distributed with great forethought. The fact is, there's an

786
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,920
unlimited amount of unhappiness for those who make their own, who can't

787
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,760
let circumstances be what they are,

788
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,320
and instead adjust their lives to have a consistently unhappy

789
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,920
vantage point. And the opposite happiness, but

790
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,800
who cares about that dumb old thing?

791
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,880
Light from our sun, friends,

792
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,860
travels 150 million kilometers. But just

793
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,080
before it gets to your sensitive eyes, you can raise up

794
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,340
your hand to block it. That's one way some subgenie

795
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,000
think about J.R. Bob Dobbs. No matter how much you think about him,

796
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,680
no matter the radiation source, no matter how fast and far it travels,

797
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:51,140
no matter how sensitive the receiving body, holding up that goofy clip art

798
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:57,540
salesman is all it takes to turn a burn into well-earned slack.

799
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:04,300
Whether you're a member of the Church of the Subgenius or not

800
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:10,820
yet a member of the Church of the Subgenius, this advice holds.

801
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,800
Regularly, get the contact information of the people you want to be in

802
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:21,160
communication with and print it on paper. Don't rely on any social media.

803
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:27,600
Don't rely on any device. Paper has its own vulnerabilities, but it's a better bet

804
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:33,200
than anything digital. Phone numbers, email, postal addresses, whatever works.

805
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:41,980
Write it down. Start today. And being an old sacred scribe,

806
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:49,100
I certainly agree with that and subscribe to it. From the Dobbs town mirror,

807
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,700
I really do. I carry pencil and paper around with me and I write everything

808
00:56:53,700 --> 00:57:01,540
down on paper, not my phone. I also use my phone, but then if it's good, I copy it

809
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:07,960
to paper because Onan is correct and true. The paper will last longer.

810
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,960
And so, I'm going to be a little bit more careful with that. I'm going to be a little bit more careful with that.

811
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,500
So, we conclude this particular section of this particular hour of slack.

812
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,180
All of it from the Dobbs town mirror and I suspect all of it from the tongue of Dr. Onan

813
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:39,420
Canobite, although the brain, the brain pan, the brain case, let's face it, they all belong

814
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,160
to Bob.

815
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:49,240
At Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

816
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:56,340
We have a new novel, a subgenius science fiction novel out. Actually, it's not a science fiction novel.

817
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:02,740
It may be a documentary history from the 60s. The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

818
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,840
We'll have the paperback version of it out fairly soon. Right now, there's just the

819
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,920
expensive hardback.

820
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,820
Oh, and always send one dollar.

821
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,660
That's funny. Nobody ever does. We're trying to think of ways to get people to send a lot

822
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,160
more. Just the very first time.

823
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:34,340
Uh-oh. My event trunk is ready. Survival of the fitness bud, says Julian from the Trailer

824
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,860
Park Boys.

825
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:41,240
So that's my cue to famus and feed the dogs.

826
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,940
Praise Bob.

827
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:51,080
Oh, and thank you, Einstein Secret Orchestra up there in heaven for this nice background

828
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,320
rug of music.

829
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,180
Praise ESO and B.O.B.

830
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,600
Bye-bye.

831
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,420
Bye.

832
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,480
Bye.
