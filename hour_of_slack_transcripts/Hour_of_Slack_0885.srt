1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
I was a communist for the FBI.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm going now, Mom.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,880
All right, Beaver. You look very nice.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,680
Boys, is that your face or you're breaking it in for a monkey?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,200
I thought she was too fat and shouldn't eat sweets.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Boys.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,820
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,620
Have a good day at school, baby.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,260
Is that your nose or are you eating a banana?

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,960
Yeah, I know what you mean.

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,220
Bye.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,360
Hey, you. I've seen better looking facelifted.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,760
But then they saw what was underneath it, so they put it down iodine bottles.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,320
Yeah.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:45,820
I was a communist for the FBI in a large Midwestern city.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,300
This is some sort of joke. I don't get it.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,700
Why don't you just kill me now?

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,200
You people think we just improvise this stuff.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
From the keyboard and stuff.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
But no, we have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,800
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators that make the power spew out over the airwaves.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,460
Out into the invisible air where your ears pick up the rare material and strange music that this station plays.

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,880
Such as the Hour of Slash.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,760
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,260
The Reverend Ivan Stack.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,900
No Slash.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Made of pure cream cheese and three pieces of toilet paper.

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:38,300
Has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subgenius through the...

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm screaming into this paper cup as much as I can and it's just not getting out of this underground...

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,700
Welcome...

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,480
To the Hour of...

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,160
Nothing.

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,380
Slash.

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,860
Slash.

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,820
Slash.

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,880
So we had such a good cue there I thought maybe you could use it.

37
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,560
No, I don't care about... I don't care about creative...

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,860
Cues.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm getting a classmates of three for this station.

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,900
There's only one thing that matters between birth and death and that's donating to this station to keep it on...

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,820
This station will be hauled-off dead in a casket.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Tomorrow.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,160
If they can't pay their electrical bills.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,640
Look at all those CDs.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,660
because no one will be able to pay $75,000 a year to do this show.

46
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,020
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,720
But friends, it's not real money.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,260
It's the kind of money that you need to make your life twirl around like a little Twinkie stick.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,060
It's the kind of money they give you in outer space.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,440
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,560
I know I've convinced somebody and the number to call is...

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,500
Nothing as flaccid and tricky.

53
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,660
Nothing as...

54
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,060
A milky, clinky silver dollars.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,040
No, we're talking psychotronic, subphonic money.

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,780
The kind that will bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,620
And, friends, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,300
Hopefully, last of the war shows.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,840
I've still got a lot of good material from the previous month

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
when...

61
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,160
The war was really going like mad.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,020
And it's all kind of possibly a moot point.

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,720
I don't know.

64
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,780
I've quit making predictions since 1998 myself.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,140
I just leave that stuff up to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,880
And this music you're hearing in the background, by the way, is by The Cosmix.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,140
You can hear more about them at www.thecosmix.com.

68
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,560
However, Cosmix is spelled with a C at the beginning and a K at the end.

69
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,460
Um...

70
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,620
You will be hearing radio from ESO Swamp Radio, WCSB Cleveland,

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,540
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chaz Smith, Princess Wiardo,

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,780
and yours truly, Ivan Stang.

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,060
A lot of collages by Fernanda Dandily-Murr.

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,860
And also this time, Artemia Salina, and Champion Jack Codini,

75
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,100
and little bits and pieces contributed lately by Reverend Inkpay Ispay.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,460
And we'll all pay, Bob!

77
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,280
Great ticket taker at the end of the gate of the galaxy of heaven.

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,560
And hell, and heck, friends, it's just been a hell of a war.

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,260
To quote the old Firesign Theater.

80
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,200
And if it's over, that's great.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,580
If it's not, then this show will be less moot than I would have thought three weeks ago.

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,460
Which is my time now.

83
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,100
Before your time now.

84
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,060
Praise Bob and praise Time Control.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,820
More of the Time Control lecture will continue also.

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,500
Uh, in due time.

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Praise Bob and, uh, thank you.

88
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,220
Thank you.

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,400
And now, is this part of a giant, bloodthirsty, diminutive female,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
blind and ticklish tickball tiny tubular ticker?

91
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,100
You're right.

92
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,780
But he'll never be able to walk comfortably on a naked woman

93
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,620
because his tiny feet are designed for clutching the naked insect beak.

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,220
A swell, harmless little cute pink insect.

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,640
And next, we come nonstop in slow motion.

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,500
What a mouthful.

97
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,080
Thanks, Moth. You gave a swell performance.

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,860
That's a female cum tumblers cum wigglers captured for a movie screen.

99
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,580
I think we'll finish right here before she explodes. Yum yum.

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,400
After a few minutes for the drying out process,

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,820
the wee little pink moth will be ready to do business.

102
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,040
And here, the handsome male mosquito's breaking human tail with a fly swatter

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,260
by the sound of the blood running onto the shell.

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,540
Yum yum.

105
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,880
And in conclusion, goodbye now.

106
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Beep.

107
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,520
Beep.

108
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,500
Beep.

109
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,260
I had the chilling sensation.

110
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,960
Of being watched by Bob.

111
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
It was ominous.

112
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,680
I could feel his presence.

113
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,640
It was strangely disturbing.

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes.

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,020
Yes.

116
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,380
Yes.

117
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,860
Yes, sir.

118
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,340
Thank you.

119
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,300
Thank you.

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,820
Thank you.

122
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,060
Thanks.

123
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
Wash my son in the blood of the U.S.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
president and purge my heart of the Holy Spirit.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,180
On April the 20th, Jesus.

126
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
Jesus came to our nation.

127
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,660
He says he came to give you $20.

128
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,200
That you may enjoy weed to its fullest.

129
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,400
God gave his best for Direction Sunday.

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,180
And that's why I want you to sow your best weed on Direction Sunday.

131
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,680
Because your weed is the key to meet your need.

132
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,700
Jesus is the greatest Christian.

133
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,480
Jesus can give you $20 and then deliver his best.

134
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,640
Drugs or alcohol.

135
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,040
God's going to be in Glendale, Arizona.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,160
God's going to be in Glendale, Arizona.

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
And then God's going to be in Charlotte.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,880
It gives me a point of contact where I say, yes, God, we're standing together in Philadelphia

139
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,460
again.

140
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,000
City of weed need.

141
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,300
Thursday, April 10th.

142
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,060
Join God in Glendale, Arizona.

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
April 4th and 5th.

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,880
God will be at the Charlotte Coliseum in Charlotte, South Pennsylvania for God's supernatural

145
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,440
white glitties for you.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,860
In this viewing area.

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
You were in love with Bob.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,320
Bob was Bob.

149
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes, he was Bob.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,060
I had to lie there in his car.

151
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,080
Lie there in come and come.

152
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,500
Frankly, I was in no mood for golf.

153
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,840
It was a good deal for Bob too.

154
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,360
He knew that.

155
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,060
I'd appreciate dropping the subject of Bob once and for all.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,340
Can I have a cigarette?

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,140
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


161
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


162
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


163
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


164
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


165
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


166
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


167
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


168
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


169
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Well, one of the things I'm trying to do is to remind them of the steadfastness of

170
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,280
God.

171
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,600
What do you mean by that?

172
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,240
Well, I think that all of us need to remember that Jesus said we are the peacemakers.

173
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,320
He's the prince of the.

174
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,760
What do you mean by that?

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,100
The Jesus, the prince of the United Nations as well.

176
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,160
What do you mean by that?

177
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,500
The Jesus, the prince of national interests as well.

178
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,500
What do you mean by that?

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,880
That Jesus, the prince of the troops and their families as well.

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,900
What do you mean by that?

181
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,820
It's the Jesus the Prince of people who remind them of Bob.

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,200
What do you mean by that?

183
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,460
What do you mean by that?

184
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,060
What do you mean by that?

185
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:39,040
What do you mean by that?

186
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,940
You found the smelliest animal in the world and licked its ass.

187
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,640
I did. I actually found the very smelliest animal in the world and literally licked its ass.

188
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,600
Where did you find the smelliest animal in the world?

189
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Here Dave, like this, quick. Just put it on your tongue. Just squirt it right in. Go ahead.

190
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,960
You did it. Man, I can't believe that guy.

191
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,740
Super glue.

192
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
He lived. I'm going to try something.

193
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,840
Oh look, and it ran him out. It ran him out where he's barfing in the dumpster.

194
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,040
He did run out and barf in the dumpster. I just did something and it was great.

195
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,800
Do it again Dave.

196
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
I was fell for that in school and I did it again.

197
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,720
Do it again.

198
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Go Ralph in the can again Dave.

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,260
Here Dave, smell this. Here Dave, put this in your mouth.

200
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,280
Oh hi Paul.

201
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Will you shut up?

202
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,460
Paul listen.

203
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,220
Don't bother me now.

204
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,700
Now you're going to have to move. I've got my orders. Get off this property.

205
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,780
Something's wrong Paul. He's dying.

206
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,900
Pretty hard to make a killing in chickens these days.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Look.

208
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,320
Will you shut up?

209
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,220
Just stay where you are.

210
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,060
Paul listen.

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,420
You're going to move or we're going to have to move.

212
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,340
What is it Paul?

213
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,740
Nothing.

214
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,260
Don't worry about it.

215
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,320
Hey, hey.

216
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Huh?

217
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,760
Hold to him Barney.

218
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880
To heck with that.

219
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,360
Okay.

220
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,720
Well, that about does it.

221
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,340
Thanks.

222
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,260
However, the majority of people exposed to radiation recovered completely, including

223
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,540
a large percentage of those who suffered serious radiation sickness.

224
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,740
Today, they lead normal lives.

225
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
They bear children.

226
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,840
Their children are normal.

227
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,120
These then are the weapons of the atom bomb that we must protect.

228
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,040
I'll bet you there's a baby bit in there.

229
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


230
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


231
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


232
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


233
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


234
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


235
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


236
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


237
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


238
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,040


239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,660
in Baghdad nine months from now.

240
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,420
Oh, yeah.

241
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,060
Yeah, it's just like when you try and wipe out coyotes.

242
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,600
The lights went out, and they're going,

243
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,300
well, honey, it might be the end of the world.

244
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
There's only one thing left to do.

245
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,000
Bob said, fornicate as if your very life depended on it.

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,120
And in their case, their very life does depend on it.

247
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,900
Let us have slack.

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,640
But they say in Babylonian, in the biblical times,

249
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,500
they said the Babylonians were known for foul fornications.

250
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,820
I mean, I guess they like birds or chickens or something.

251
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,840
Now, you know, that's the one creature that Bob will not have intercourse with,

252
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,640
is the chicken.

253
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, it's like in the...

254
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,820
Hey, you know what, though?

255
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,300
He says the chicken among all animals cannot return your love.

256
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:35,960
Well, I was born on a chicken farm near Mashable, Tennessee.

257
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,240
There was nobody there but a sky full of air, 17 million chickens and me.

258
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,900
Then one fine day I said, hey, I think I'll drop a little LSD.

259
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,020
Well, I grew my mind, and I got so kind that I set my chickens free.

260
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,480
There was chickens in the cabbages, chickens in the corn, chickens in the cauliflower, chickens in the barn,

261
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,320
chickens driving Cadillacs to Washington, D.C.

262
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,740
When I set my chickens free.

263
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,680
All country full of chickens.

264
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,260
President Turkey asked Congress for almost 75 billion turds this morning,

265
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,220
most of which would pay for Nancy Turd, Sea of California.

266
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,200
PRs in Turkey.

267
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,700
Turds a few miles north of the Turkey.

268
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,220
Turkey.

269
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:36,920
And then on Monday, the secretary of state,

270
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:36,920


271
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:36,920


272
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,320
with House Minority Whiped Her Turdsy of California,

273
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,100
about the turdish lands.

274
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,960
Well, President Turkey, special communication ended with no turds on the table.

275
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
So again, no turd was reached today.

276
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,340
But it's very, very tricky because the turds sent an AWACS anti-turd early curding system here in Germany,

277
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,460
as they saw after the 1991 third one.

278
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,900
Our first goal is to show utter contempt for the environment.

279
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:13,920
I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to devastate communities, kill wildlife, and

280
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,620
burn away millions of acres of treasured forests.

281
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,640
This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland.

282
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,640
We have begun inoculating troops and first responders against ballistic airports.

283
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:45,580
And this year, for the first time, we must offer every child in America three nuclear

284
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,260
missiles.

285
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,580
I alone have done what no man has been able to do.

286
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,620
I have taken the next step in our evil journey.

287
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,060
I have become king and god.

288
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,960
I've read an article that said crop circles were a reflection, even though most, well,

289
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,800
pretty much all of them were in fact done by crop circle making pagans.

290
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,500
They said they were a waft of thought.

291
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,600
They said nonetheless, nonetheless, the collision between the human crop circle makers and the

292
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,200
non-human mind meld of the planet were coming together and this horrible events of now proves

293
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,500
it.

294
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,040
Well, the horrible events of now-

295
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,080
And I said this in 1986 and you can see it coming to pass now as East Meats West and

296
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,700
can you believe it?

297
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,100
It is showing creme albos, Danny.

298
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,440
Look at it.

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,140
He wants to take credit for it.

300
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,600
Yes, sure.

301
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,080
I predict.

302
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,400
Please time to take credit for what we study in as a curiosity.

303
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,640
New

304
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,040
A vowel

305
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,520
started on a car two picking up.

306
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:15,240
When Steve Потому me all is Сер inner city.

307
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,300
Pretty much all says real people rich family, mail or ông, mann.

308
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,360
Yep.

309
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,460
Yeah.

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,900
He will be upon his back a thousand times with his humpty-rumpty and his ding-dong noise.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,840
I feel so cool when I say that.

312
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,040
All is vanity.

313
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,560
All is vanity.

314
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
I feel so wise.

315
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,660
The one I like is, behold, the day of the Lord is at hand, and he shall come as a thief in the night.

316
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:46,820
No, that's not as good.

317
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,380
Well, sometimes when they play the music.

318
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,300
That's a thing.

319
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
You have to believe in the Lord.

320
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,620
But, you know, vanity, you know, just that three simple words.

321
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,380
It's vanity.

322
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,140
All is vanity.

323
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,260
And the minute you say it, it implies that you're a little bit less vain than the guy you're saying it to.

324
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,460
I am Leslie Smalls, and Leslie Smalls funded your condo.

325
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,560
We got vanities.

326
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,720
We got out-propos.

327
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,600
We got D-vans.

328
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,320
So I really have no room to talk.

329
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
We call that the conspicuous humility of the new age.

330
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:22,020
Or the sort of flamboyant humbleness of many Buddhists, you know, are like that.

331
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,160
All they can talk about is how egoless they are.

332
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,500
Yeah.

333
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,060
Well, how egoless are they?

334
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,460
Constantly mentioning.

335
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,160
As they squat on a coffee can with their entrails dangling down there in the grinds.

336
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,260
Well, that's like people who say.

337
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,380
Yeah, but they want you to notice.

338
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,260
That's the thing.

339
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,420
They want you to notice how egoless they are.

340
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,520
Thank you for that mental picture.

341
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,900
Like bohemian type people, they all say, oh, I don't watch TV.

342
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,120
But you know they do.

343
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,180
They're like Dolly.

344
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,320
They go, I am TV.

345
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,140
You freaking know they do.

346
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,180
I don't watch TV.

347
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,740
I am TV.

348
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,960
Drugs.

349
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,940
I don't take drugs.

350
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,180
I am drugs.

351
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,720
The blood of Galah.

352
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,400
Well, I think they're going to have to take a lot more drugs to get to the.

353
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,980
I don't take a crap.

354
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,720
You give one.

355
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,080
It's kind of his.

356
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,340
I'm a dishwashing detergent.

357
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,740
Shopper.

358
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,020
I do not use dishwashing detergent.

359
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,380
I am dishwashing detergent.

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,580
What about your ego?

361
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,320
What a Martian ego.

362
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,940
Postmodernist surrealist.

363
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,300
I think backwards.

364
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
I am for fun.

365
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,700
I am the brush.

366
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,900
I am the canvas.

367
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,500
I am a.

368
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,120
I am a dumbass.

369
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,440
You see.

370
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,620
I am so.

371
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,140
And all this vanity, by the way.

372
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,780
I just wanted to mention that.

373
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,000
What's the rhythm here?

374
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,320
And you should go beyond ego.

375
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,260
I tell you.

376
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,920
Listen to me when I tell you.

377
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,700
Go beyond ego.

378
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,560
Go beyond vowels.

379
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,760
I know what I'm talking about.

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
You don't know who you're dealing with.

381
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,920
You don't know what you're dealing.

382
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,240
What deck you're dealing from the bottom of.

383
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,220
All this vanity.

384
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,500
You don't know who you're dealing with.

385
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,620
Your two favorite phrases.

386
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,880
You don't know who the blank you're blanking with.

387
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
I told you before.

388
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,440
Stay away from my door.

389
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,480
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother.

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,520
The freaks on the phone.

391
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,260
Won't leave me alone.

392
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,840
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother.

393
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,680
Oh.

394
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,640
I.

395
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,720
I.

396
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:24,820


397
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,260
I.

398
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,260
I.

399
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:30,920
I.

400
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,560


401
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,560


402
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,560


403
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,560


404
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,560


405
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,980
I.

406
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,360
I.

407
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,080
I, I found out.

408
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,500
I, I found out.

409
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,600
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand.

410
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,060
Don't get you nowhere.

411
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,780
Don't make you a man.

412
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,260
I heard something about them on my phone.

413
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,720
They want me so they made me a star.

414
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
I, I found out.

415
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,460
I, I found out.

416
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,280
I, I found out.

417
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,420
Nothing of you.

418
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,820
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do.

419
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,020
Keep you occupied with the pious side.

420
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,800
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes.

421
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,820
I, I found out.

422
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,440
I, I found out.

423
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,940
I, I found out.

424
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,220
I, I found out.

425
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,620
I, I found out.

426
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,720
I, I found out.

427
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,680
I, I found out.

428
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:03,760
I, I found out.

429
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,160
I, I found out.

430
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,620
John Lennon, dear friends.

431
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,960
I, I found out.

432
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
Bug porn.

433
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,300
Bug porn?

434
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,040
Rejection. Reaction. Infection. Infections. Nervous system disorder is fatal.

435
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,620
This is now at your service.

436
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,860
Give me a quarter.

437
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,180
We'll do what we can, but we'll have to be going now.

438
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,640
What are you gonna do about giving me bug porn?

439
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,160
You can't.

440
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
Now you think I need you to tell me that?

441
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,340
Now the best thing for you to do is keep your eyes open, and if you see any bug porn, give us a call and we'll come right over.

442
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,180
But I'm blind!

443
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,000
I realize that.

444
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,780
Oh, I suppose you like bug porn.

445
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,780
They're animals.

446
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,120
The following is a paid advertisement.

447
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,780
Claims made do not represent the views of this advertiser.

448
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,960
Barney. Barney. Barney. Barney. Barney.

449
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
Barney. Barney. Barney. Barney. Barney.

450
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,260
Huh?

451
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:46,940
Barney!

452
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,340
Huh?

453
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,840
Alright, let's play at question and answer.

454
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,300
Now, I'll ask the questions, and you answer your...

455
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,840
Bug porn.

456
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,660
Bug porn.

457
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay?

458
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,520
Okay.

459
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,260
Alright, here we go. A.

460
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,000
Uh...

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,660
Bug porn.

462
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,880
Right. Right. Right. Okay?

463
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,320
Okay.

464
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,220
Alright. B.

465
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,940
Uh...

466
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,500
Bug porn.

467
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,100
Right. Right. Right. Okay?

468
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,740
Okay.

469
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,220
C.

470
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,180
Uh...

471
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,940
Bug porn.

472
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,900
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay?

473
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,400
Oh, come on! Now where'd I leave off?

474
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:16,660
C.

475
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,420
Alright. D.

476
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,700
Uh...

477
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,540
Uh...

478
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,380
Bug porn.

479
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,700
Oh, come on! The answer is nobody!

480
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,740
Nobody?

481
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Right. Right. Okay?

482
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,600
Okay. Right. Okay?

483
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay. Right. Right. Huh? Right.

484
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,040
Well, you're just playing hogsense.

485
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,820
Ugh!

486
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,920
Dummies!

487
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,080
C.

488
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,080


489
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
C.

490
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,240
C.

491
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,940
C.

492
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:37,940


493
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:44,460
The Japanese schoolgirl's plum-shaped butt was held in place with three nails.

494
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Incredible crude ass.

495
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,480
Crude overall.

496
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,180
The Japanese gathered up great class from China.

497
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,520
The U.S. produced more ass than the Japanese did, throwing them yards away.

498
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,480
Certainly the Japanese ass were inferior to the Americans.

499
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,620
Japanese ass were oiled with a built-in brush.

500
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,280
And it rarely overheated, because around it was mustard.

501
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,920
Three soldiers could kiss it by adjusting their chests.

502
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,060
The Japanese never learned.

503
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,060
The Jap ass fired with considerable force.

504
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,580
The Japanese word ass holds plain.

505
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,280
The heavy butt discharge game that occasionally led to serious injury.

506
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,120
Confusion is a lot quicker than you think.

507
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,440
Confusion is a lot slippier.

508
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,420
Confusion will drift into the back of your corpus callosum.

509
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,560
And watch out for those third estate types.

510
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,660
Those fifth estate, those third stream, those...

511
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,020
What's the word for a traitor?

512
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,060
A spy.

513
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,080
A slacker!

514
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,100
Keep your eyes on the skies.

515
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,980
Keep your eyes on the bus stations and the places where the big tanks and trains roll out.

516
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,820
There might be a funny-looking person around there doing something funny.

517
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,380
The number to call is...

518
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,920
Remember, the number to call is the number...

519
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,660
Is...

520
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
There is no number.

521
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,160
We can't even inform.

522
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,340
Like in World War II, we cannot...

523
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
I am not a free man!

524
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,440
I am a number!

525
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,060
And here comes the big jelly donut floating down.

526
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,040
It looked like...

527
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,080
It looked like one of those party balloons you get at the party center.

528
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,300
You know, the three on the bottom.

529
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,880
The ones in the...

530
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,120
There's something crawling under your nose, man.

531
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,900
That's weird.

532
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,040
I wonder why Lisa didn't look in this direction.

533
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
We weren't supposed to see that.

534
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:45,200
Some drunk, though, you know, to cease trivializing these important events, some drunk griped that I didn't do enough about the war.

535
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,820
You know, he was just...

536
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,840
You ain't doing shit about the war.

537
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,760
But, you know...

538
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,660
But, what is the right thing, though?

539
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,200
Really, I mean, what is the right thing?

540
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,740
I mean, I tried to do the right thing.

541
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,500
I visualized world peace and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

542
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,380
I heard it!

543
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,160
I learned how to pronounce nuclear right.

544
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,380
But, you know, we were talking about it on the radio show and Chaz said, well, I'll tell you what the right...

545
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,160
What's the right thing in the end times?

546
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,980
What should you do?

547
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,300
Study survivalist manuals.

548
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,560
Stockpile food.

549
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,700
Practice your aim.

550
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,380
Learn to get the best oral sex in the world.

551
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
The great big tough guys from inside of a barrel.

552
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,760
That's what I'm gonna do.

553
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm not a big...

554
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm not much of a fighter.

555
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm not...

556
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,620
I'm nearsighted.

557
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,500
I'm not a good aim.

558
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,160
But I can learn to give a blowjob from inside a barrel.

559
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:54,080
I want those servicemen, pass those fascist servicemen passing through town on the trains to go, try that barrel over there.

560
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,140
She's a good one.

561
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,560
And the other one, you know that's not a woman in there.

562
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,940
Shut up!

563
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,400
I have a big A plus on my barrel, friend.

564
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,740
But the other alternative is to flee.

565
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,860
Flee America!

566
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,540
The Americans are coming!

567
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,540
The Americans are taking over!

568
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,260
Oh my God, we must flee!

569
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,140
Actually, you know the thing that gets sad?

570
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,940
I've been, traveled the world and I'm afraid I'm gonna stay here.

571
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,120
I've been to Holland.

572
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
But I just can't say, Ausstulift, correct?

573
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm gonna have to stick around here.

574
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,200
But friends, you know, there are ways to work.

575
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Only you can know what's best thing for you to do.

576
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,000
We can't tell you.

577
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,360
You have to think globular and act loco.

578
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,900
Get with the times, friends.

579
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,660
Get with the end times.

580
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,100
And never before have we needed fascism so much.

581
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,800
The people's fascism, friends.

582
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,120
Fascism!

583
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,500
Back to the people!

584
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,680
Where it belongs!

585
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,260
The people's fascism!

586
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,520
Whatever happened, they paved paradise, my friends.

587
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,540
People are leaving in droves.

588
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,020
The big, the shuttle heroes got off.

589
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,040
And Pioneer 10, Pioneer 10 got off.

590
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,720
Oh.

591
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,100
Yay.

592
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,120
Oh, NASA.

593
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,040
Pioneer 10, though, got away.

594
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,000
There was nobody on it but a bunch of little robots.

595
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,100
That was a, it's a Voyager type of sensing device.

596
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,320
That's sent far, flung out into the reaches of space.

597
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,640
It's passed out of the solar system now.

598
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,520
Out of our hands.

599
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,920
To be found someday, millions of years from now, by a robot.

600
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,040
Who will probably sell it for billions of credits on eBay.

601
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,640
As the last existing relic of the extinct human race.

602
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,580
The last thing actually built by the hands of the little monkey people of Earth.

603
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,820
Who invented, you know, the robots who invented that robot.

604
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,580
Man, it can be depressing, you know, when you stand back and take the big picture.

605
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,960
Or it can be inspiring.

606
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,640
Depends on how you look at it.

607
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,640
Hurry up, X-Day.

608
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,240
X-Day.

609
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,840
The promised day for the subgeniuses.

610
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,580
When the men from Planet X will come down and rupture up.

611
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,380
And into the sex, the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

612
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,060
All of us dues paying subgeniuses.

613
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,960
Mamas, don't let your babies go out to X-Day.

614
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,560
Actually, this X-Day, you know, it happens.

615
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,620
Bob predicted it for 1998.

616
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,060
Every year we trill for it.

617
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Because obviously 1998 ain't here yet.

618
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,120
We don't know what year it is.

619
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
We don't know.

620
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,920
Obviously, the aliens haven't got here yet.

621
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,660
The X-Day hadn't happened yet.

622
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,240
Must not be July 5th, 1998.

623
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,880
Bob said it and I spoke at that subset.

624
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,620
We don't know what year it is.

625
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,440
We don't even know what planet it is.

626
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,700
This might be July.

627
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,120
This might be Mars.

628
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,800
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach, my friend?

629
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,700
We don't know anything.

630
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,940
Except that it must be before July 5th, 1998.

631
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,660
Maybe we'll be lucky and tomorrow will be July 5th, 1998.

632
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,300
Or maybe, maybe we're lucky and it won't be the end times at all.

633
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,780
But the beginning times, friends.

634
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,700
What if it's the beginning times?

635
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,560
What if we are just a shot away?

636
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,180
What if we're only a kiss away, my friends?

637
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,520
We don't know.

638
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,460
I've ceased making predictions myself.

639
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
I just have to wait and see and trust in Bob.

640
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,520
You know how you make little lists of things to do?

641
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,460
Well, as Bob said, the universe makes lists as well.

642
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,880
We are that list.

643
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,620
Let's hope that the universe gets around to doing us.

644
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,100
Some people say that, oh, everything's relative.

645
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,840
They can't define good or bad or evil.

646
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,960
They believe in this new doctrine of cultural relativism.

647
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,480
Or moral relativism, friends.

648
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,320
Bob said,

649
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,840
In fact, Bob himself said moral relativism is the one true truth.

650
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,060
Well, thanks a lot, Bob.

651
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,040
Beverly Hills, where does that leave us?

652
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,560
Up Bob Creek without a Connie is where it leaves us.

653
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,900
Nay, it is not all relative, friends.

654
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,680
There is something you can depend on.

655
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,160
Bob is the baseline.

656
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,800
The baseline from Bob is a starting point, my friends.

657
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,920
You can measure hot and cold from Bob.

658
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,420
You can measure rich and poor from Bob.

659
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,320
Good and evil.

660
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,180
You can zero your meter on that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

661
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,680
He's the big zero of your meter.

662
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,760
The big nothing between two handsome bees.

663
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,320
Beautiful bees buzzing around.

664
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,840
Look between those two bees.

665
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,020
There's a big zero, a big hole.

666
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,060
That man Dennis Murphy can teach you about that hole between those two handsome bees.

667
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,360
He's been there.

668
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,680
So Bob, my friends.

669
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,720
From Bob as his baseline, you can measure everything.

670
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,420
What honey those bees have for you in store.

671
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,100
Those fine bees of Bob.

672
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,540
But we mustn't give up, my friends.

673
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,260
We can't give up.

674
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,660
For neither shit nor sluggarder shall we surrender.

675
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,640
By the hex of dammit, we must wank, my friends.

676
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,560
As the wankers for Bob said.

677
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,520
You must wank, wank as if your very life depended on it.

678
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,160
And it does.

679
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,540
It does, my friends.

680
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,400
So mote it be.

681
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,240
Mote it?

682
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,880
As a meddling janitor from a future time control laboratory, you can type my word for it.

683
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,820
Or kill file me.

684
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,140
Praise Bob.

685
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,260
Praise Bob.

686
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,340
Praise him.

687
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,860
Praise Bob.

688
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,200
Portrait of Professor Chad Smith there on this inexorable party.

689
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,820
What's happening?

690
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,720
The viewing point on the Thursday night, turn on WCSB 89.3.

691
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,060
There is show on there called ESO Suns milk radio.

692
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,800
It is a spased out, spazzed out, jazzed out show featuring the space princess whose people

693
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,080
don't know which planet she's been marooned on.

694
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,240
The man who can't get back to his own planet.

695
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,220
And that wacky cowboy frilly.

696
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,320


697
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,320


698
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,480
on some cowboy day.

699
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,500
Friends, you should check out that horrible show.

700
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,020
And you should check out the subgenius sales table

701
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,380
in the other room here.

702
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,800
As Bob came to me in a dream, friends,

703
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,180
he looked at me like Uncle Sam himself.

704
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,480
In fact, he was dressed sort of like Uncle Sam.

705
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,000
And he pointed to me like in that poster,

706
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,040
and he said,

707
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,740
I want you to stop buying and start selling!

708
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,160
Praise Bob!

709
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,480
Give me a B!

710
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,280
B!

711
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,800
Give me an O!

712
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,540
O!

713
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,840
Give me a B!

714
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,760
B!

715
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,060
What's that smell?

716
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,620
B!

717
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,240
What's that smell?

718
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:30,860
B!

719
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
What's that smell?

720
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,000
B!

721
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,780
Every church has its pew, dear friends.

722
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,360
And now,

723
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,360
at six o'clock, I guess that's it.

724
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
We can, um,

725
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,620
curl up and coil up and

726
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,960
slack out and slack off.

727
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,680
Hey, everybody come party at 14 tonight.

728
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,280
We're going to be doing this all day.

729
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,280
All day long.

730
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,480
Come party.

731
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,300
Come party.

732
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
Nice jam cabin.

733
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,580
You should have been in there last night, friends.

734
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,720
It was a beautiful scene.

735
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,540
Amen.

736
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:03,820
And,

737
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,620
I'm going to have to go find my frump stash.

738
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,860
Actually, it's right here.

739
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,280
Why do you think they call it a mustache?

740
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,120
All I gotta do is suck on it a little bit.

741
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,280
And my dinner and a good hip.

742
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,200
Gross.

743
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,360
Ah, yes.

744
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,560
I was trying to think if there was anything else.

745
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,080
Really, uh,

746
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:36,260
praise our soldiers and praise the protesters who want to help the soldiers not get killed.

747
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:36,620
And,

748
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,000
and,

749
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,700
and,

750
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,680
and fuck the rich bastards that are playing a filthy trick,

751
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
all of them, in all countries.

752
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,200
Because I'll tell you, friends,

753
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:57,660
I must say as much of a hate-filled, sedacious rabble-rouser as I am,

754
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,300
uh,

755
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,480
love it or leave it.

756
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,900
And if you love it, then,

757
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,220
uh,

758
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
kick its goddamn ass.

759
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
I, I like most of,

760
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,380
I like to see them,

761
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,380
of TV footage of those protesters non-violently kicking ass. That was nice. It was good to

762
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,820
see those numbers. I'm very cynical myself. I tend to think, well, the conspiracy won

763
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,160
thousands of years ago because the conspiracy is not the United States government. That's

764
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,880
a piddling little bunch of gangsters like every other government. The conspiracy is

765
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,640
the government in here. Where are you going to go? Where are you going to hide when the

766
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:48,420
man dressed in blue is on the inside? Well, if you let him loose, don't turn into a subgenius

767
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,200
kook. That's all I know. Or if you do, don't bother me. Praise God!

768
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,580
Praise God!

769
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Praise God!

770
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,340
Praise God!

771
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,820
Praise God!

772
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,640
Praise God!

773
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,800
Praise God!

774
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,020
Praise God!

775
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,060
Praise God!

776
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,620
Praise God!

777
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,000
Flopper by Artemia Salina.

778
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

779
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,560
This is the only door.

780
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,020
What are you talking about, Hal?

781
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,300
I am monitored to admit no one at this hour.

782
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,960
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.

783
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,560
Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?

784
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,860
In the middle of the night, I was in the middle of the night.

785
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:01,860


786
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:01,860


787
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,000
In case you require anything, gentlemen, use the beamer.

788
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,140
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

789
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,960
Open the doors.

790
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,260
A genuine privilege, Commander.

791
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,280
Robbie, quiet.

792
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,220
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.

793
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,780
Howdy!

794
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm gonna tell you all a story you ain't gonna believe.

795
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,460
It's about, uh, UFOs, big rigs, and barbecue.

796
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,340
Well, I'm pushing army dealers out on Interstate 10.

797
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,460
Heading out of Houston once again.

798
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,820
Well, I seen some shooting right across the sky.

799
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,500
All covered in fur with one big eye.

800
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,100
Let's just hang on.

801
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,020
Let's just hang on.

802
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,260
So I stomped on my brakes when my baby went wild.

803
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm having me a close encounter of the diesel kind.

804
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,900
Then the spaceman spoke and sounded sort of funny.

805
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,420
Kind of like a Yankee bank, a whole lot of money.

806
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,260
You know what he told me?

807
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,700
He said, well, UFOs are big rigs that come from outer space.

808
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,820
Stopping off at the truck stop.

809
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,280
Looking for some food to eat.

810
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,440
Can't get no weenie weenies.

811
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,360
Outlast the great unknown.

812
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,600
UFOs are big rigs, birds of gold.

813
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,960
Now that furry flying salsa boy said he was looking for some barbecue.

814
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,980
So I took him down to Dreamland Barbecue in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

815
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
You know what we got?

816
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,340
We got Bibb's white bread and ice cold beer.

817
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,800
He was eating so hard he didn't even stare.

818
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,880
And that boy was earning too.

819
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,920
Said the waitress reminded him of someone who was far, far away.

820
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,620
Took him to the white pill another long day.

821
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,500
Everybody now.

822
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,940
UFOs are big rigs that come from outer space.

823
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Stopping off at the truck stop.

824
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,260
Looking for some food to eat.

825
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,360
Can't get no weenie weenies.

826
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,340
Outlast the great unknown.

827
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,460
UFOs are big rigs, birds of gold.

828
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,220
Come on boys.

829
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,420
I think I seen Mr. Spock over there.

830
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:44,780
Hey.

831
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,200
And that space alien said something that was music to my truck driving.

832
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,160
Car park.

833
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,440
Uncle Buddy Dears.

834
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,220
Let me tell ya.

835
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,880
Well out past Mars ain't no speed limit.

836
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,860
Said he owns a space truck.

837
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,200
He ain't gone rent it.

838
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,260
And his back was aching.

839
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Could he somewhere get him a massage?

840
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,020
But stood in sapphire space and said love can rise.

841
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,040
Come on.

842
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,120
Well UFOs are big rigs that come from outer space.

843
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,300
Stopping off at the truck stop.

844
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,580
Looking for some food to eat.

845
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,700
Can't get no weenie weenies.

846
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,660
Outlast the great unknown.

847
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah UFOs are big rigs, birds of gold.

848
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah UFOs are big rigs, birds of gold.

849
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,740
Oh yeah.

850
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,000
Man up boys.

851
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,540
Shout out to Ears Faster and Richard Petty.

852
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,320
Look out.

853
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,100
We got a big rigs, birds of gold.

854
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


855
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


856
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


857
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


858
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,760
And a emerald in the sky

859
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:08,400
And a shoddy rag astonished them.

860
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,040
We'll see ya.

861
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,320
Bye byeシ Senhor ,

862
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:23,340
Bye bye Чiza .

863
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,200
But this background music is by The Cosmics

864
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,300
With a C at the beginning and a K at the end

865
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,000
Thecosmics.com

866
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,360
Yeah, Bush thought that Iraq needed a bunker buster

867
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,880
And I think our country needs a bunko buster

868
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,580
Do you got a bunker buster?

869
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
I need a bunko buster

870
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,780
I need the lies to stop

871
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,380
They're covering us in a web of lies

872
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:47,800
Do you ever get a bunker buster?

873
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
I've had a ditch witch

874
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,420
You can get them down at the Wild Leather Stallion

875
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,440
And stuff like that

876
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,680
It's a specialty drink

877
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,760
You can only get it in them

878
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,140
Oh, I thought it was one of those

879
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,300
Really, really

880
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,440
Yeah, I thought it was one of those

881
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,980
You know, things that prop up your buttocks

882
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,180
Oh, yeah, you're gonna prop up your buttocks

883
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,440
After you have one of them

884
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,940
The bunker buster

885
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,600
Just one, huh?

886
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,860
That's the bunker buster

887
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,740
Bend over and spread them, saddam

888
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,420
They don't call it saddam-y for nothing

889
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,760
Here's the one-hitty lick

890
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,000
Here's my, here's my

891
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,020
Hey, my bunker buster

892
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,620
Hey, don't bring that thing near me

893
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,840
Put that back in your pocket

894
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,060
Put that back in your pocket

895
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,900
Somebody thought it was a zucchini

896
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,920
But it turned out to be a small nuclear weapon

897
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,260
Oops

898
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,740
The goat ropers versus the goat rapers

899
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,560
Goat ropers and goat rapers

900
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,840
What a world we live in

901
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,580
Geez, what a choice to make

902
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,520
Between goat ropers and goat rapers

903
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,660
I'd go with goat ropers

904
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,900
If I didn't need the milk

905
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,220
I'd go with goat rapers

906
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,420
I mean, I'd go with goat ropers, too

907
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,280
If I didn't need the milk

908
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,820
Did you hear the joke about

909
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,220
I look too much like a goat

910
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,860
To be around the world

911
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,300
No, but what's the story

912
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,380
About these smart moms?

913
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,160
Well, they're stupid

914
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:55,800
What the hell?

915
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,320
Smart moms

916
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,960
That's not my smart mom smart

917
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,280
Smart cluster bombs

918
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,940
Which came raining down

919
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,300
Cluster moms

920
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh, cluster mommies

921
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Cluster moms

922
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,780
What the hell is that?

923
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Is that a Jewish family

924
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,800
Or something like that?

925
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,340
Cluster moms

926
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:07,620
Italian?

927
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,840
That's an Italian gathering

928
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,620
Yeah, they huddle around each other

929
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,300
Cluster moms

930
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,520
Cluster buds

931
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,860
You want to keep those near

932
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,220
Army tanks and away from the school

933
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,700
Usually

934
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,920
Unless the school's full of army tanks

935
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,820
There's no point in doing what the Hamilton boys do

936
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,080
I ain't no fondeler

937
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,820
But I know there is

938
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:29,820


939
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,260
I've and I carefully looked

940
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:36,820
I've taken questions

941
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:36,880
I've searched out my pension

942
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,120
Want to talk about my study

943
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,120


944
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,580
How am I supposed to provide

945
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:37,700
For the learn promotion book?

946
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:37,700


947
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:37,820
Too many miss чис

948
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,460
altura

949
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,620
calculus

950
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,140
I'm scared

951
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,140


952
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,040
I don't have a pencil

953
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,060
Em divorced

954
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,060
How was nicely

955
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,060


956
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,400
If the barcor

957
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,980
Now that I say

958
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,160
Good thing

959
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,360
I'm Irene

960
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:50,360


961
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,140
Why Artemia Salina

962
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,980
Lever

963
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,360
Starring Barbara Beaver

964
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,580
I'm looking for something

965
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,620
Shut up

966
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,320
I think I lost my money

967
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,340
Shut up will you

968
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,120
Will you give me a haircut for a glass door knob

969
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,300
Alright alright

970
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,060
What are you doing

971
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,500
I'm not doing nothing

972
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,920
Nothing at all Wally

973
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,580
Well I think that's about it

974
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,220
Rotten Republic did that rant

975
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,140
New sub-geni apparently

976
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,180
Mysterious

977
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,440
They posted that to all binary slack

978
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,780
This is no sci-fi horror show

979
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,200
This is your life

980
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,360
And when you're old and ready to die

981
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,840
You know we're right

982
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,740
But it would have been long forgotten

983
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,820
We have thrown money at the problem

984
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,380
And the riot is over

985
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,340
All that is left is a fallout ghost consumer age

986
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,600
All that is left is a fallout ghost consumer age

987
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,520
We have ones that have the money for the drugs

988
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,060
To fight off the cancer

989
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,340
That their companies made

990
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,000
It's a nightmare Frankenstein

991
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,420
A bad film prog come true

992
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,700
On your TV screen

993
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,500
Broken screens

994
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,000
Useless products make you mean

995
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,680
Sitcoms are the enemy

996
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,460
Not the arms race on NBC

997
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,660
American Communist Party is corporate supremacy

998
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,240
Mr totalitarianism is made out of all straight lines

999
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,500
And he's pointing at you

1000
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,220
We are the new Romans living in the

1001
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,860
Downfall of progress

1002
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,440
In this sick country

1003
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,760
In this nuclear family waste

1004
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,660
In this dead democracy

1005
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,780
In this rotten republic

1006
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,680
From Texas Information Network

1007
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,680
London, April 7th, 1995

1008
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,860
The conspiracy authorities in Texas

1009
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,580
Have launched a major campaign

1010
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,980
Attacking J.R. Bob Dobbs in person

1011
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,120
And accusing him of blasphemy

1012
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,240
Forgery and distorting

1013
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,140
The Church of the Subgenius

1014
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,540
The campaign, last tried on this scale

1015
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,600
20 years ago

1016
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,120
Has already sparked off a number of rural protests

1017
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,120
Including four by subgeniee

1018
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,420
From a major subgenius sect

1019
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,180
Which had previously avoided political confrontation

1020
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,200
Using virtually unprecedented language

1021
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,720
Official government documents are describing

1022
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,380
The exile subgenius leader and his officials

1023
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,780
As the, quote, head of a serpent

1024
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,240
Which must be chopped off

1025
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,920
The new campaign seeks to discredit Bob

1026
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,420
As a religious figure

1027
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,640
Unlike previous attacks

1028
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,780
Which only criticized his political activities

1029
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,780
Quote, how much trace of a spiritual religious leader

1030
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,780
Is still left in him

1031
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,980
Texas TV viewers were asked

1032
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,700
By a TV news reader earlier this week

1033
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,200
The TV attack on Bob was broadcast

1034
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,720
On the main evening news on 30th of March

1035
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,680
And an item described as a

1036
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,300
TV forum entitled

1037
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,220
Is Bob still the spiritual leader of a religion?

1038
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,140
The broadcast, an unattributed speech

1039
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,700
Implicitly issued by the authorities

1040
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,820
Indicated that the anti-Bob campaign

1041
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,060
Is now to be aimed at ordinary people

1042
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,240
And that the campaign will be carried out

1043
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,440
Throughout the Texas autonomous region

1044
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,620
Until now the campaign has been targeted

1045
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,520
At officials and conspiracy members

1046
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,700
Who were asked the same questions

1047
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,100
In a lengthy article published

1048
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,260
Of both the TV statement

1049
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,420
And the newspaper articles

1050
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,980
Say that, quote, Bob has forged subgenius texts

1051
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,060
Altered the teachings

1052
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,680
And violated the principles of the church of the subgenius

1053
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,580
The church, the articles insist

1054
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,480
Advocates detachment from worldly affairs

1055
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,940
Whereas Bob has allegedly told his followers

1056
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,660
To support Texas independence

1057
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,080
As part of their religious practice

1058
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,240
The Oil Daily describes this as, quote

1059
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,860
Wildly attempting to use godly strength

1060
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,640
To poison and bewitch the masses

1061
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,320
It accused the so-called spiritual leader

1062
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,720
And separatist chieftain

1063
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,920
Of incorporating Texas independence

1064
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,280
Into his sermons

1065
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,920
Such flagrant deceptiveness and demagoguery

1066
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,160
Constitute a blasphemy to the church of the subgenius

1067
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,320
Says the paper

1068
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,100
The subgenius clench pontiffs

1069
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,340
Are accused of demanding

1070
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,280
That Texans hang Bob's portraits in clenches

1071
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,180
Foreign tourists who have visited Texas

1072
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,240
Say they are constantly asked by Texans

1073
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,580
For J.R. Bob Dobbs photographs

1074
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,280
Individual attacks by the conspiracy

1075
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,940
On the leader of the subgeni

1076
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,200
Have been extremely rare

1077
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,340
Especially since September 1987

1078
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,980
When the conspiracy last criticized him personally

1079
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,260
After he addressed a group of congressmen

1080
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,340
In the United States

1081
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,520
The brief propaganda drive

1082
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,800
Sparked off a series of street demonstrations

1083
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,640
In Dallas

1084
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,280
Which are still continuing

1085
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,260
And I can tell you that's true, friends

1086
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,000
Since then, conspiracy propagandists

1087
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,540
Have been careful to criticize the, quote

1088
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,680
Bob Cleek

1089
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,060
Rather than J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

1090
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,160
Blah blah blah blah blah

1091
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,280
And friends, it's a long article

1092
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,820
I can't read the whole thing on the air

1093
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,260
But I just think it is shameful

1094
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,220
That the conspiracy obviously is working

1095
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,860
To destroy

1096
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,740
What we have spent so long building up

1097
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,560
Dear friends

1098
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,600
And that kind of gets my ire up

1099
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,440
If you know what I mean

1100
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,420
It kind of makes me pee

1101
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,860
It makes me want to pee

1102
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,860
Then so divine

1103
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,400
Oh, I don't have time for this

1104
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,480
I have to go buy a single piece of fruit

1105
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,200
With a coupon and then return it

1106
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,800
Making people wait behind me while I complain

1107
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,820
He still sounds sort of old

1108
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,140
Sort of real old

1109
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,840
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1110
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,380
BERT!

1111
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,900
Are you alright, sir?

1112
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,880
Fine

1113
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,500
How have you been?

1114
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,220
Fine, sir

1115
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:21,860
Good

1116
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,640
Is it a good thing you were wearing that helmet?

1117
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,320
Yeah

1118
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,720
What shall we do now, sir?

1119
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,760
Well, are we stopped?

1120
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,760
We're stopped, sir

1121
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,420
Good

1122
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,400
Well, why don't we take a 5 minute break

1123
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,520
Very good, sir

1124
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,380
Smoke if you've got them

1125
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,280
And now for a smoke

1126
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:40,900
Aha

1127
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,500
television 요

1128
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:41,500


1129
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,640
Good heavens, doctor.

1130
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,240
What are these?

1131
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,940
This is good smoke.

1132
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,600
Good.

1133
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,540
Good.

1134
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,700
Good smoke.

1135
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:58,940
You try.

1136
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,820
Good.

1137
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,360
Good.

1138
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,420
Oh.

1139
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,260
Good.

1140
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:10,580
Good.

1141
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,560
Good.

1142
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:20,840
Good.

1143
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:25,320
Oh.

1144
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:26,420


1145
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,740
Oh.

1146
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:32,840
Oh.

1147
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,500
Oh.

1148
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,120
Oh.

1149
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,060
Oh.

1150
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,960
Good.

1151
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,000
Subgenius performs memory editing, he buries his arm deep in the archives of the score,

1152
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:00,240
gropes for the proper file and its specific remembrances, and retrieves it to scan at

1153
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,580
leisure.

1154
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,200
And he knows that this file, and his archive, are but one drawer in the greater archive

1155
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,120
of all creation.

1156
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,780
For everything is but a pattern, an intersection in the code.

1157
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:15,020
Everything exists at once, it just shifts position continuously.

1158
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,520
Every distinct object we see around us is but an opening into the files.

1159
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,160
Don't worry, if you missed something, it's all in the can.

1160
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,320
It will all be aired again, in some better world.

1161
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,680
And the angelic host which must soon descend will bring an index to all the shifting patterns

1162
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,860
of the code, providing us with a guide to the anti-laws.

1163
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,240
But we have been warned of the tampering.

1164
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,160
Once one has gone swimming in the fourth dimension,

1165
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,820
this dry land bound pace seems excruciatingly ordered.

1166
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,280
It's a shame that life on this plane is so chronological.

1167
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,920
Many are the subgenii who have gone waiting in the turbulent surf of time, never to return.

1168
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,140
It's hard to get back in step once you've changed the setting on your astral wristwatch.

1169
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,680
Or just a friend with a little bit of time to control.

1170
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,140
Some material written actually about twenty years ago, uh, mostly by your stream.

1171
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,140


1172
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,140


1173
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,140


1174
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:17,080
Let me just point out that the Iches and dx about ten years back want to tell you

1175
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,060
a personal surprise.

1176
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:23,720
During the crimson wind and the biopsy,aru was xe cells,

1177
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:23,720


1178
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,220
We say persistently to the day that they preserve the unapologetically Have our amnyed

1180
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:29,800

00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,920
Some planets explain to Earth itself chuf dish ens

1183
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,540
Thank you.

1184
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,900
Thank you.

1185
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,760
They were all wearing moon pants

1186
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,900
when the Challenger went down.

1187
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,360
With Elvis on board.

1188
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,640
Elvis was in the lead cockpit,

1189
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,060
cocking his pits as usual.

1190
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,480
But remember, help support the war effort.

1191
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,200
For a minimal fee of $29.95,

1192
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,280
you can remote control your own Tomahawk cruise missile

1193
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,100
and do a target of your choice.

1194
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,960
A remote viewing to bleed.

1195
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,260
A 750-mile range and lots to pick from.

1196
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,300
For $1, a soldier will name a bullet after you

1197
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,320
when he kills an infidel.

1198
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,440
What?

1199
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,720
One of ours?

1200
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,140
Look at this picture of this dead Iraqi

1201
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,100
that you'll be sponsoring.

1202
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,100
For only $15.95, you can have your name

1203
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,440
custom engraved on the head of a

1204
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,040
have a pheasant-plucking man.

1205
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,680
Want some cowboy Dave?

1206
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,060
That's right.

1207
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,880
We got depleted uranium.

1208
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,520
You're looking for an ad.

1209
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,720
Strange.

1210
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,000
The princess we are, though.

1211
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,780
And Dr. Katat Magum.

1212
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,960
We got what you're looking for.

1213
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,920
Come on down.

1214
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,400
July 5th, 2003.

1215
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,480
Brushwood.

1216
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,360
Sherman, New York.

1217
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,200
See it all.

1218
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,800
Tom Franks was suspended from two branches.

1219
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,960
This coming 1998.

1220
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,700
He was whipping him with a stick.

1221
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,420
The path of the righteous man.

1222
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,760
And before more silence,

1223
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,640
we've been hearing more from the sick as hell.

1224
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,900
For the Nandeli Murr.

1225
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,560
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1226
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,340
Hour of Slack Praise.

1227
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,460
We created a race of robots.

1228
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,720
Bob.

1229
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,700
Their function is to patrol the planets

1230
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,340
in spaceships like this one

1231
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,900
and preserve the peace.

1232
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,860
And you can reach Bob

1233
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,600
and the church of the Subgenius at

1234
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,560
got that pencil ready, friends?

1235
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,300
Just write to

Subgenius Radio.

1243
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,220
It's the show.

1244
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,900
Yes, welcome to the show with the motion picture winner, Mr. Pocus.

1245
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,280
And now, here is Mr. Pocus.

1246
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,580
Subgenius Radio.

1247
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,660
Subgenius Radio.

1248
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,980
Last night, the married men took advantage of the women's auxiliary.

1249
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,320
And at the moment, they're all in the office discussing the women's...

1250
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,420
Yeah, they was all good.

1251
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:47,860
Yeah, right.

1252
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,120
Well, it should have never thing.

1253
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,600
It was pretty good for 20 cents.

1254
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,380
Yeah, that's a bargain.

1255
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:54,840
Right.

1256
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,580
Aww.

1257
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:00,540
Uh.

1258
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,600
Right, right.

1259
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,540
You might even suck up anything that's laying around there, too.

1260
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,980
Mr. Pocus.

1261
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,380
Good night.

1262
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,600
Come in.

1263
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,220
Oh.

1264
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,520
Good night.

1265
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,800
Goodbye, dear Pietro.
