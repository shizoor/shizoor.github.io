1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,020
Yeah, let's make it an hour. Go ahead, let's go for it.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,940
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Black.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,420
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,940
Oh, Bob loves you, dear friends.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,420
And yes, we're going to get right back into it.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,740
This is the third show of three shows that I had to do in one night.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,320
And I'm still going strong, friends.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,080
Still going strong because I'm so excited because X-Day is about to happen.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,960
Again, and again, and again.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,380
Well, sure, it may have actually happened or not happened a month ago by the time you hear this tape.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,460
But I don't care. It's what we call time control, dear friends.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,080
In the Church of the Subgenius, there is this doctrine called time control.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,700
And it is, well, it's just exactly what it says.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,400
That's all you need.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,060
If you had time control, you'd already know what the hell I was talking about, now wouldn't you?

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,880
But to recap, now where are we?

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,500
We are rubbing it in because you didn't get on the escape vessels like we did.

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,240
You're not listening to this show from somewhere in deep space,

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,100
surrounded by luxurious drunken pleasure goddesses.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,820
No, no, you're probably just in...

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,400
Or who knows?

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,720
Maybe you did get ruptured and you liked your life so much

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,280
that even when you were given the gift by the excess of being able to do anything you ever wanted,

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,540
instantly, by magic, you decided to just recreate the world you'd always lived in.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,440
Because you liked it.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,340
The same dingy apartment or house, the same friends, the same job even.

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,860
Who knows?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
You know, some people are really into that.

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,960
Maybe XX Day did happen.

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,320
You're happier than you know.

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,900
Yes, friends.

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,060
I want to hear this Therion here in the background for just a second, shall we?

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,980
Therion.

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,680
I want to hear this Therion.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,300
I want to hear this Therion.

37
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,080
I want to hear this Therion.

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,100
I want to hear this Therion.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
I want to hear this Therion.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,320
Oh, friends, you know it's a wonderful world, but don't be humble because you're not all that great,

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,840
as Golda Meir once said.

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,900
And as Arthur Miller said,

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,540
Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody loans him money.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,640
And I know how that goes, friends.

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,400
I guess I'm one of them kidders he was talking about.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,700
But, oh, what shall we actually...

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Now that that guy is...

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,880
Whoa!

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Cool!

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,420
That wasn't a...

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,820
I bet you thought that was some kind of a sound effect.

52
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,520
What I just did.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,980
Where did all those tapes fly off?

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,120
Man.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
Well, that's amazing.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, I'll just stick...

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,540
That's one...

58
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,140
That's a cue.

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,620
What?

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,340
Did the...

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,500
Friends, I swear to God, I think it was a poltergeist that time.

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,080
Again.

63
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,260
We used to have that trouble.

64
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
Oh, I...

65
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,900
They came flopping down from way up here.

66
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,940
Up atop the...

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,300
Well...

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,380
Hold on just a second.

69
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,620
And I mean a second.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,980
Oh, see, it wasn't even a second.

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
We had it all together.

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,160
It's not so bad.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,440
Everything's all right.

74
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,540
Just relax.

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,540
Bob is here.

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,020
Bob will make everything right.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,640
I...

78
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,060
I trust and pray, my friend.

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,220
My dear, dear friend.

80
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,060
You're all such good friends.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,360
Don't you know?

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,440
It's not...

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,980
I mean, even the ones I've never even seen.

84
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,220
I see...

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Yet I am able to sap your energy just by knowing that you're...

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,500
Even weeks later after this is recorded,

87
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,940
I can still do this.

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
I can still do that because of...

89
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,860
Yes, once again, time control.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,060
You see, time control.

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,020
Anyway, we do have some...

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,800
This was just handed down by Bob.

93
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,940
Before I play all the great, amazing audio collage and music

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,560
and stuff that I have coming up,

95
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,180
and X-Day and so forth,

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,660
I want to...

97
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,760
We're going to have to lay down the ground rules.

98
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,260
This was a big memo that came down.

99
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,080
It's not very subgenius-like,

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,820
but apparently,

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,440
these are the, believe it or not,

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
the dance band rules and regulations

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,540
for the hour of slack.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,860
Unfortunately, this is not a joke.

105
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,560
Number one.

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,080
In the repertoire of light orchestras and dance bands,

107
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,600
pieces in foxtrot rhythm, or so-called swing,

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,400
are not to exceed 20%.

109
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,120
So we can't play more than 20% of our music

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,700
as any kind of fast,

111
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,400
fast stuff.

112
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,820
In the repertoire of this so-called jazz type,

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,900
preference is to be given to compositions in a major key

114
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,720
and to lyrics expressing joy in life,

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,480
such as the great hit

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,340
rather than pinkishly gloomy lyrics.

117
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,680
Wait a minute.

118
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,620
I thought that subgeniuses were the ones that had the gloomy lyrics.

119
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:49,900
Okay.

120
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,000
As to the tempo, also, says this memo,

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,600
supposedly,

122
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,120
from Bob,

123
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,580
preference is to be given to brisk compositions

124
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,560
as opposed to slow ones,

125
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,680
or so-called blues.

126
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,220
However, the pace must not exceed a certain degree of allegro,

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,740
commensurate with the subgenius sense for discipline

128
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,980
and moderation?

129
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,340
On no account will doctor-like excesses in tempo,

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,240
or so-called hot jazz,

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
be permitted,

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
or in solo performances,

133
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
so-called blues,

134
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,240
be permitted,

135
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,160
or in solo performances,

136
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,540
and can only achieve, at most,

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,700
10% syncopation.

139
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,460
Normally, it should have a natural legato movement

140
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,080
without the hysterical rhythmic differences

141
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,440
characteristic of the music of the barbarian races

142
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,900
and conducive to dark instincts alien to the subgenius people.

143
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
How strange.

144
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,020
Friends, this just doesn't...

145
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,280
Oh, now I get it.

146
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,880
It wasn't...

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,660
I got this.

148
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,280
I got this.

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,360
I got this.

150
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,360


151
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,820
Actually, what I was reading to you

152
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,680
was in real-life rules and regulations

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
for the Third Reich.

154
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,800
And it wasn't signed by Bob,

155
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,280
but was signed by

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,260
Baldur von Blodheim Reich Musikführer

157
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,980
und Uberschaufführer SS.

158
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,460
Honest to God, friends.

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,140
And he actually said,

160
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,480
rather than Jewishly gloomy lyrics,

161
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
is what he was talking about.

162
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,800
He thought Jewish lyrics tended to be...

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:25,800


164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:25,800


165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,940
be now why would why would why would Jewish lyrics in Germany around World War II have any

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:41,480
sort of a gloom to them and um and they said it said it actually the original document said

167
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:50,440
on no account will negroid excesses in tempo or so-called hot jazz be permitted well friends

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm not a big fan of rap music myself because I'm kind of old but I'm so glad that does very

169
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,980
same old bastards in Germany that used to agree with this kind of stuff have to listen to loud

170
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:12,000
negroid boombox music you know every time they go out on the street and a car goes by that's

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,700
what I take me me hit yeah you know Bob Dobbs himself I don't I can't speak for Bob but

172
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,420
Bob

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:30,580
Bob said a long time ago that the only people he hated were Nazis I think that he also he didn't

174
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:39,920
specifically say this but I've gotten the impression that he hates commies too but as as

175
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,900
Woody Allen said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve immortality

176
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,340
through not dying

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,460
and friends that is what happens when you become a subgenius you don't die you live forever or

178
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,080
triple your money back eternal salvation or triple your money back as the old saw goes and I want to

179
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,860
say one more little quote have I already done these quotes I can't even remember

180
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:20,100
Groucho Marx said marriage is a wonderful institution but who wants to live

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,440
in an institution friends let's go back to the tapes thank you

182
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,180
oh this this music in the background incidentally is of course Einstein's secret orchestra thank you

183
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,380
you're welcome

184
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,940
I was riding down main street in my car 41 under slung coupe I was all decked out in my blue suede

185
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,400
shoes and my hair was covered with goo I was listening to my radio and waving all the chicks

186
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,220
when the music stopped and the newsman said

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,200
we interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,280
they destroyed the world the entire Los Angeles area

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,380
already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain and civil defense authorities

190
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,120
state the situation is much the same across the entire country martial law is now nationwide

191
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,980
major cities in all parts of the country in New York Los Angeles report plague victims falling

192
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,520
dead in the streets in their home at their work the first symptom appears to be severe choking

193
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,900
followed by immediate unconsciousness death occurs within minutes whether a state of war between China

194
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,540
in Russia still exists is not important any longer. Our fellow countrymen are dying. The

195
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,580
very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that

196
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,740
horror, long feared germ warfare. Colorado Channel, this is a class one emergency. All

197
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,360
civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways. Stay in your homes. Stay in your

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,440
homes. Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution. Stay

199
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,780
in your homes. Repeat, Colorado Channel, this is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic

200
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,900
is barred from streets and highways. But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here

201
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,220
unsaved, you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record, who know not Jesus

202
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,740
Christ, once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment, and millions

203
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,940
will die in those next few years.

204
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,420
Watch World War III on pay TV. Television can be quite a thrill. Sitting home in your

205
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,680
chair, watch the boys over there, charging across your TV screen, being blown to smithereens.

206
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,280
Watch World War III on pay TV. If you want to keep the kids at home, they'll be glued

207
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,540
to their sets, watching rockets and jets, blowing up schools and factories, putting

208
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,640
an end to the birds and bees. It's worth every penny to tune in and see who wins the Emmy

209
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,420
at the ruin of the academy. Watch World War III on pay TV.

210
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,500
Before your television bounces away.

211
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,640
All revved up and ready to go.

212
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,400
Turn around, go back down, back the way you came.

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,860
Can't you see that flash of fire, ten times brighter than the day?

214
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,140
And behold, a mighty city, broken in the dust again.

215
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,960
Oh, God, proud man.

216
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,420
Broken in the dust.

217
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,720
Broken in the dust again.

218
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,620
It's gonna be me, and it's gonna be you.

219
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,700
We're gonna do everything we want to.

220
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,920
It's gotta be now, and I can't wait.

221
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,100
Sink about a beer in all that pain and hate.

222
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,340
Oh, like a flame in the time that's burning.

223
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,520
It's gonna be like George Bush on a plane.

224
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,940
Staring into the cold.

225
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,680
Gonna be a new world.

226
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,140
Gonna be a new one.

227
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,520
If you can say it to anyone's life, words.

228
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,940
If there's nothing left for you, they say, soon you'll be dead anyway.

229
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,300
Well, there isn't.

230
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,140
Well, there isn't.

231
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,420


232
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,420


233
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,420


234
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,420


235
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,600
It's getting out of hand

236
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
It's all I'm feeling

237
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,000
Lost my mind and I don't care

238
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,880
So close your eyes

239
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,300
And get your hands off your mind

240
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
And think about the times

241
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,880
You've been and what they've been

242
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,860
To me it's not a game

243
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,500
To me it's not a game

244
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,260
To me it's not a game

245
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,600
To me it's not a game

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,660
We're only gonna die

247
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
From our own arrogance

248
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,640
That's why we might as well

249
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,460
Take our time

250
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh, you're so slow

251
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Oh, you're so slow

252
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,980
You can't stop me

253
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,500
You can't stop me now

254
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,240
Bob, Bob, Bob

255
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,800
Bob, Bob, Bob

256
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Bob, Bob, Bob

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,420
You can't hide from J.R.R. Bob Jobs

258
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,900
And his face has been mimeographed

259
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,080
And put up in more places than yours has

260
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,340
You can't hide from God

261
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,900
You can't hide from J.R.R. Bob Jobs

262
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,540
Cause more people worship him than worship you

263
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
You can't hide from J.R.R. Bob Jobs

264
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,520
from jobs for these super you are

265
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:32,620
think of all the hate there is in red china then take a look around to selma alabama you may leave

266
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:41,040
here for four days in space but when you return it's the same old place the pounding of the drums

267
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,900
the pride and disgrace you can

268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,320
you can bury

269
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,400
you can bury

270
00:16:44,420 --> 00:17:03,680
you can bury your dead but don't leave a trace hate your next door neighbor but don't forget to say grace and tell me over and over and over and over again my friend you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

271
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,160
oh no no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

272
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:41,140
oh no no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

273
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,840
oh no no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

274
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,780
oh no no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

275
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,660
mankind is garbage and womankind too cause your bottom line's how many people you screw

276
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,920
walking your way to the head of the pack by cheating deceiving and licking the crack

277
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,320
of dishonest people who think like you who want a jacuzzi and a room with a view

278
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,580
a wife who acts stupid and makes you feel right if she has big tits and her teeth look right

279
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,140
of course you respect her and your marriage won't flung as long as she's a big kisser and her teeth look right

280
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,860
As long as she puts out when you come home drunk

281
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,020
She thinks you're garbage and you think she's scum

282
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,000
You'll both be content if you manage to come

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,220
Promotions received when you lick the brown star

284
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,340
Just help reinforce what you think you are

285
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,380
It's not worth as much as a turd to me

286
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,720
You're a smegma on toast and that's all I can see

287
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,380
So call me a cynic and call me a bore

288
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,560
And don't change the truth that you're still a whore

289
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
To the worthless existence you know that you need

290
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,820
Fueled by the lies that you eat, sleep and breathe

291
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,900
Fueled by churches and unions and such

292
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,020
And corporate sleazeballs can't get enough

293
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,080
Prankstein, football, pretzels and beer

294
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,580
The problems, the commies, the Jews and the queers

295
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,880
You walk out as hell subterclused in the hills

296
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,900
Jack off with weight machines smooth as in pills

297
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,040
The money you've wasted on your muscle tone

298
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,140
Would be better spent on a coffin and stone

299
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,240
To lay you to rest in a permanent grave

300
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,520
Keepin' what's left which I gladly would save

301
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,700
So call me a cynic and call me a bore

302
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,620
To pay for the funerals of assholes like you

303
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,660
And Christ, Bob

304
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,760
On your grave in the fog in the deep chow

305
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,480
On your grave in the fog in the deep chow

306
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,900
On your grave in the fog in the deep chow

307
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,320
What of the limitless sex and violence

308
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,700
In the wake of Ragnarok?

309
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,760
Welcome to the slaughter

310
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,100
What are you going to do?

311
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,660
What will be your epitaph

312
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,840
When we get done with you?

313
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,400
Are you gonna cry for your mama?

314
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,760
Are you gonna have a good time?

315
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,480
Are you gonna be a bohub?

316
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,700
Are you gonna be a bohub?

317
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,460
Are you gonna turn to die?

318
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,180
Without a good place to cage in?

319
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,260
Bedlam all around

320
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,000
Parakeet here

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
Rural street in the Ragnarok party town

322
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,160
Bob the Gabler, he was very fun

323
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,680
He was very fun

324
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,960
He was very cool

325
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
He had a third-world war

326
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,820
Bobby Komodo, who almost fell off the floor

327
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,040
He said, I never engaged in this type of thing before

328
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,800
But uh, yes I believe it can be very easily done

329
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,780
Just put some breeches out in the sun

330
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,820
and uh, have an hour on Highway Sixty-One

331
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,180

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:26,700


354
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:26,700


355
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:26,820
In my Jeep

356
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,100
Out here again

357
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,940
D Malaysian

358
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,080
Balfiction

359
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,660
Top Congratabt

360
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:51,540
I'm not a picture, I'm not a picture, I'm not a picture for you

361
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Not a picture, not a picture for you

362
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,760
Guess I think I'll go back to beyond the veil

363
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,700
Way, way over here

364
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,720
If my baby don't love me no more

365
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,980
Lord, I know good will, Lord, that I'll hold you

366
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,900
Oh, sister, wait

367
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,740
Oh, sister, wait

368
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,340
Oh, sister, wait

369
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,960
Please, Papa, come kill me, Papa

370
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,620
I wanna die for Papa

371
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,860
I wanna die in a holy, holy thrill

372
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,740
But that's not the best I can do

373
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,540
Boys in the normal state

374
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,000
We have to

375
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,620
If we have to

376
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,860
Follow me and I

377
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,940
And we'll all come back over

378
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,320
And we'll all come back over

379
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,780
And we'll all come back over

380
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,400
Men all over

381
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,520
We will fly

382
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Oh, yes, what a

383
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,080
Wonderful, wonderful tune

384
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,580
There from

385
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,840
From, uh, the good

386
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,480
The good, good

387
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,260
Reverend Doug No. 4

388
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,680
Who got scared by the Church of the Subgenius

389
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,180
Very shortly after doing

390
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,840
That very song

391
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,860
And, well, we never heard from him again

392
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,980
And for all I know, he might be listening to this show

393
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,540
Going, where's my royalties?

394
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,240
But, uh, well, he

395
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,960
He's not gonna lack for royalties

396
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,800
Dear friends, because he'll be on

397
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,580
Those saucers

398
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
And I hope

399
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
I hope that you will, too

400
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,620
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day

401
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,140
But it is crazy that we've predicted these things

402
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,900
We said we were gonna do these things

403
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,540
And here we are

404
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,980
One month away

405
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
Are we rushing? No

406
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh-uh

407
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,720
Have we done our test launchings? You bet

408
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,580
Are we happy with the results of the launches? Yep

409
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,140
You bet, most of the time

410
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,240
Uh, and, uh

411
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,660
Do we feel confident

412
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,560
Stepping into this, uh, pleasure?

413
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,580
You bet

414
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,540
You bet

415
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,120
We're there

416
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,940
We're there

417
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,380
So, the only question is

418
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,200
Are you gonna be there?

419
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,700
To witness it?

420
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,820
You mean you're just wanting to have yourself a

421
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,340
I've never fallen into the pits

422
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,840
Come on

423
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,900
You wanted to have yourself a trans-carnal, homosexual Chris with Bob Dobbs?

424
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,860
Well, it's not homosexual if it's with Bob

425
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,560
That's right

426
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Bob is all that's a fantasy

427
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,720
I never understood that part

428
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,200
Bob is a male gender, isn't he?

429
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,080
Well, Bob said so

430
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,960
I mean, that's what he

431
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
Like, if Bob kinda gets ya

432
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,160
That's not like something to feel

433
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,780
You should be proud of yourself

434
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


435
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


436
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


437
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


438
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


439
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,780


440
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:03,800


441
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,580
So, Bob bends you over that log and says you gotta write pretty mouth

442
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,580
You got a ticket on that old, uh, red, I mean, uh

443
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,260
Hey, man, what do you think the job application's like around here?

444
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,380
I don't know

445
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,240
I heard some of them were in languages that no one's yet been able to figure out

446
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,420
Height, weight, tightness, lubricity, tongue speed

447
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,700
Lubriciness, sac clearance is a very important statistic

448
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,080
Seed sac or egg sac? That's the only thing you gotta answer on my questionnaire

449
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,160
Is you a seed sac or is you an egg sac?

450
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,680
Well

451
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,680
That's all we are is a bunch of damn seed sacs and egg sacs

452
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,000
Ah

453
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,880
Hey, speak for yourself, bub

454
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,100
Well, you know, I'm

455
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,260
Bud

456
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,480
Some people bud

457
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm not both, I'm a seed sac

458
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,820
Some are neither seed sac nor egg sac but merely bud hosts

459
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,120
Oh, yeah, well

460
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,180
These seed sacs by the seashore

461
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm sure they could count

462
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,100
You could count many of them in your company, Sting

463
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,480
There's still time to turn your back on salvation

464
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,740
You can hit the off button on your CD player

465
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,180
And then you can play the song

466
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,480
You can change the radio station you're listening to

467
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,200
There's still time to turn your back on salvation

468
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,180
But not much time

469
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,940
And that's real

470
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,140
And it will become visible on X day

471
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,440
A glow that's visible even in daylight

472
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Any given page of the printed word Bob will be

473
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,840
Not only of practical use as lamps in the dark

474
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,300
But more importantly, they'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures, dear friends

475
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,160
The most valuable things on the whole planet

476
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,940
Because you're safer if you have that

477
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,780
If you've got a copy of the show with you

478
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,420
It tips your luck playing

479
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,500
It helps a whole lot against radiation and landslides and brain worms

480
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,440
And noise demons and nerve runners and all that

481
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,700
It isn't nearly like having a membership card

482
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,380
But it's a lot better than having nothing

483
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,700
Because, friends, your faith

484
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,960
Your faith in Bob will be all you have left on that day

485
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,000
And he'll know whether you believed in him

486
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,480
Wotan will know

487
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,460
And he will come

488
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,540
He will come to judge

489
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,320
And now, here are my predictions

490
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,560
Listen

491
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Listen carefully

492
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,080
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow today

493
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm not gonna judge you

494
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,700
But I'll see you do your thing

495
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,480
I'm judging you

496
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,020
I predict public executions will be shown on television

497
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,060
Sponsored by your local gas company

498
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Securing the faith

499
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,740
That the future is filled with good things for you and yours

500
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,480
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex

501
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,840
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period

502
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,900
School built on sweet potato pie

503
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,040
Gee, that's a headline

504
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,940
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into the air

505
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,280
People would soon quieten and not be hurt

506
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

507
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,520
She is a cutie, isn't she?

508
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,220
What a girl

509
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,520
Right on campus as part of getting high

510
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,740
I mean, uh, getting a higher education

511
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,520
Which is just wonderful in any language

512
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
Here's Bobby

513
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,040
LSD is running its mad course

514
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,420
With babies now being born hideously deformed

515
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,420
From women whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug

516
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,560
Which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch of the United States Army

517
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,060
As a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy

518
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,000
Here you see the heroic robots, the leadys

519
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,960
Who defended San Francisco against the dastardly attack

520
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,780
All right, I've seen enough

521
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,680
Well, you know, who knows what could happen here?

522
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,740
Bob got to Reagan in time and saved him

523
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,420
And President Bush is, uh, we think he's gonna be getting better soon

524
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,840
1983 will be seen in the first televised executions

525
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,160
Don't you mean the clone of President Bush?

526
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,380
Well, he...

527
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,520
That goes without saying

528
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,580
I don't expect him to believe that

529
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,520
We can't ask, we can't ask totally

530
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,820
They have entire clone farms there in Argentina

531
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:29,400
Basically all our world leaders and politicians are only clones of their original...

532
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,220
Cells, their original brains taken out

533
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,800
And, uh, replaced by robotic, exist green energy demon brains

534
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,320
Like the ones that work at convenience stores

535
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
It's right over my right

536
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,620
What is it?

537
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,620
I gotta get out of here

538
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,600
This won't trouble you, go on

539
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,400
You're remembering everything now

540
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,360
And I try to maintain control

541
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,540
So Betty cannot tell that I am scared

542
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,520
Oh, I am so scared

543
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,580
Then go on

544
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,600
This won't hurt you, experience it

545
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,740
It won't harm you now

546
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,000
I gotta get my gun!

547
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,460
I gotta get my gun!

548
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,040
I gotta get out of here!

549
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,880
I gotta get my gun!

550
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
I gotta get my gun!

551
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,900
I can't!

552
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,760
I can't!

553
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,420
I can't!

554
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,040
I can't!

555
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,820
I can't!

556
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,160
They're not emotional

557
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,800
Angels don't have any emotions

558
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,340
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious that it's the worst in human history

559
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,820
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands

560
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:47,500
Every hour we are getting news that our factories and our refineries and schools are being attacked with rays of an unknown origin

561
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,600
They haven't been analyzed so far

562
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,060
Thousands of people are dead

563
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,280
The attacks are not coming from outer space, our scientists say

564
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,340
And certain monsters have been seen that appear to come from before the Ice Age, long before the history of mankind

565
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,300
They have to be stopped!

566
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,940
Professor, I know you've been in this book line study for many years

567
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,160
You know more about them than we do

568
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,860
Tell us, what should we do?

569
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,200
Hmm...

570
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,740
Don't go up there at night

571
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,900
Stay in the sunlight

572
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,540
Keep yourself safe and secure

573
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,540
And in the daylight, we'll draw you out of there

574
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,120
You've got to use all your power to knock them out

575
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,380
All your power, believe me

576
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,760
Laser guns?

577
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
Laser guns

578
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,360
Not only laser guns, but your crew

579
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,280
Get them up there and knock them out

580
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,620
The mushrooms appear

581
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,460
You'll be sipping your beer

582
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,780
Zooming in will zoom our limbs

583
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,520
Watching while the whole world ends

584
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,800
It's worth every penny

585
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,220
To tune in and see

586
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,240
Who wins the Emmy

587
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
At the ruin of the academy

588
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,660
Watch World War III

589
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,520
On TV

590
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,940
Before your television melts away

591
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,920
La la la la

592
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,420
Before your television bounce away.

593
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,000
I like them in beans.

594
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I like them in beans, too.

595
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,680
I like anything in beans.

596
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,420
I like when Mr. Beans and some of the other Lagoon family comes over and bothers my children.

597
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,740
And eats them.

598
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,780
He eats my children.

599
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,220
He bites their heads off and then he shacks out the inside.

600
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,220
And then he sticks his tongue out.

601
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,940
Hey, you guys, I was thinking of rotating out myself.

602
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,660
Your what?

603
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,620
I was thinking of rotating out so Bleepo can call.

604
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,600
I want to get back to burning memories.

605
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,160
I got a memory burner.

606
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,620
A memory burner?

607
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,220
Somebody donated this memory burner to the church.

608
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,880
It's taken me two days to get it up and running, but I can burn memories now.

609
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,880
It's like if I experience something, I can flop it on this little disc

610
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,120
and burn the memory.

611
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,880
It's like if you give me your brain, I can burn that memory over to your brain.

612
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,560
Wow.

613
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,880
It's just like erasing the bad experience.

614
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,260
Well, I wanted to chat with you.

615
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,220
No, no, it doesn't erase anything.

616
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,880
It's more like sharing the bad experience.

617
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,280
Oh, man, I thought you had a sure way out where you'd burn that memory and everything

618
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
that went with it was gone like it never happened.

619
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,980
Well, once you've burned the backup copy, you can erase the master.

620
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,960
And then if you ever need something from that bad memory, you can just install the backup.

621
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,080
Yeah, you've still got the memory on a disc.

622
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,120
And you can...

623
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,420
You can, you know, if you have to have it.

624
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,160
Well, I...

625
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,760
Yeah, but it's a little complicated because we have to take the bulk eraser and run it

626
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,300
over the plate in your head a few times in order to erase the original memories.

627
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Then we have to load all the good memories back in just so that...

628
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,180
Oh, let me rub your head.

629
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,760
...you can save up all the room that was in other ways taken up by the bad memory.

630
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,460
Okay, well, I...

631
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,300
So it's not all bad.

632
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,220
Well, I needed to chat with you sometime about artwork-y kind of things, so I'll give you

633
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,880
a ringy dingy one of these here days.

634
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,120
Well, things have slowed down temporarily.

635
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,200
Uh, a lot.

636
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,960
Although, next we have Portland and then both, you know, X Day, hell, we'll have all

637
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,320
the time in the world after July 5th, 1999.

638
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,340
That's right.

639
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,960
There won't be any more days as we know them.

640
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,460
Yeah.

641
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,700
As men reckon time.

642
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,300
No.

643
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,940
As Dave reckons bacon.

644
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,960
In pain.

645
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,340
There'll be all that extra time for you to have those necrophilia experiments and to

646
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,120
just, I don't know, sit by the riverside smoke lemonade...

647
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,300
One month from today.

648
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,560
...longer than one.

649
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,620
One month.

650
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,320
Is there a phone number?

651
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:31,820
Is there a phone number, Reverend, that people can call to find out about that one month

652
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:31,820


653
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,840
Uh-oh, he picked up the telephone.

654
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,380
Yeah, there...

655
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,000
Damn it, where is...

656
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,220
I should have that number right in front of me.

657
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,620
There is...

658
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,640
It's the Devival Hotline number.

659
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
Oh, wait, I can tell you what it is.

660
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,320
It was misprinted in the last Dark Fist.

661
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,940
Oh, my.

662
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,480
And I know the correction.

663
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,360
It is...

664
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,460
Here is the number.

665
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,540
It's the Devival Hotline number.

666
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


667
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


668
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


669
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


670
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


671
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,540


672
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,400
I'll give you the number for the Devival Hotline.

673
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,480
Area code 216...

674
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
Oh, it's right there in Cleveland.

675
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,720
Uh-huh.

676
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,860
5560338.

677
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,740
That's the subgenius Devival Hotline.

678
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,180
Information on X day.

679
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
216-556-0338.

680
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,740
There you go.

681
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,560
Oh, no.

682
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,280
Yeah.

683
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,760
And now...

684
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,500
I'll send you a tape of that little spiel I did earlier, too.

685
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,240
I got some tapes for you, so I'll send those along.

686
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:22,640
Yeah.

687
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,740
In fact, if you can't...

688
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,280
If you don't know how the heck you're gonna get to Brushwood, hey, try the subgenius rides

689
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,860
board.

690
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,100
There you go.

691
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,520
Then you can...

692
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,360
At www.subgenius.com slash rides...

693
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,100
You might find somebody to hang out and sleep with the whole festival.

694
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, but don't hang out with the rides spore.

695
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,960
Remember that.

696
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,640
It's different than the rides board.

697
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,100
The rides spore...

698
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,340
If you can't bring them to sleep with that...

699
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,960
If they're quicker than any of us because they're airborne...

700
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,300
The rides...

701
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,640
You don't hang out with the rides spore.

702
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,240
And folks, if you're planning to camp out at Brushwood, remember to bring lots of penicillin,

703
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,260
rattlesnake...

704
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,780
And socks.

705
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,420
... antidote, face-riping bat sperm antidote pudding.

706
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,960
Needless to say, I don't know.

707
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,160
Yeah.

708
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,960
And extra socks.

709
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,980
Per carload.

710
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,600
Dental dams, bacon, bacon...

711
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,500
Full-body condoms.

712
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,040
Bacon stairs.

713
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,380
Yeah.

714
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,800
Double-headed dildos.

715
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,360
Really?

716
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,060
You think we're...

717
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,140
Double-headed dildos.

718
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,280
We don't need to encourage them to bring...

719
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,280


720
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,280


721
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,280


722
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,060
Bring more of those.

723
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,720
There's gonna be plenty of them as is.

724
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,340
I told you we'd make it.

725
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,600
My ship doesn't get radar challenged leaving Mars.

726
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,160
You know that my father's rocket attack is planned for 8 a.m. tomorrow, Earth time.

727
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,000
Yes, I know.

728
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:38,280
But what you probably don't know is that Moon is sending two waves of attacking rockets.

729
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,300
Two waves?

730
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,160
Why?

731
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,080
For 50...

732
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,680
There's something happening right before our eyes that's more clear than the face

733
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,140
of the sky.

734
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,160
And yet many are overlooking it.

735
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,960
What's happening?

736
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,260
The moon is sending two waves of attacking rockets.

737
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


738
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


739
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


740
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


741
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


742
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


743
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


744
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


745
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,260


746
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,700
Long ago, the prophets of Israel predicted a very precise pattern of events that would

747
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,000
all come together and so forth.

748
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,780
Now, there would be general signs in the weather and in physical phenomena.

749
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,240
Dorothy saw a cloud on the horizon even.

750
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,720
It was big and black.

751
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
And from the north she heard something.

752
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,080
Loud.

753
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,360
We all saw it.

754
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,580
Heaven's to the market side.

755
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,820
That sound could mean only one thing.

756
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,400
Bob.

757
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,240
Bob.

758
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,020
Bob.

759
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,780
Bob.

760
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,040
Bob.

761
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,740
Bob will protect you.

762
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,180
Who?

763
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,240
Who's Bob?

764
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,240


765
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,240


766
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,240


767
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,940
Uh, if you don't know that, I can't tell you.

768
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,220
We're gonna be just like him.

769
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,020
33 years old, I don't know.

770
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,520
Nobody else really knows.

771
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,260
All I know is our body will be just like his.

772
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,160
No death, no sickness, no sorrow, no need of rest.

773
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,420
You won't have to go to bed at night, lock your door.

774
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,660
An eternal, glorified body just like his.

775
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,120
Now, Bob, I think I got a little problem.

776
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,460
Is the UFO mystery truly a scientific water gate?

777
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,600
An incredible and dangerous cover-up?

778
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,240
Understanding of the UFO may be beyond our science and our knowledge.

779
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,240


780
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,240


781
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,140
The UFO is a human political system.

782
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,920
... twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology.

783
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,960
Thank you.

784
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,300
Um, and Bob, by the way, is running for Big Brother or, uh, Universal Overlord or County

785
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,440
Clerk in 1984.

786
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,280
Yeah, that's right.

787
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:02,720
We weren't here.

788
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,800
He knows he's not gonna win, uh, Big Brother.

789
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,760
It's just to plant the seeds in the minds of the people.

790
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:17,100
Bob either wants to be, uh, County Clerk or, uh, Over God of all reality, uh, in 1984.

791
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,220
Well, as Alex said, Bob's a big brother.

792
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


793
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


794
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


795
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


796
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


797
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


798
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


799
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


800
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,220


801
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,420
He's a big brother to the two Christians that are running for it.

802
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,740
As Alistair, as Alistair Crowley once said, if I, uh, if I can't be God, I'm not gonna

803
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,100
play.

804
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,940
This ain't no video game church.

805
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,300
It ain't no church of bingo.

806
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,600
It's a church of Bob.

807
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,380
It's a Bob righteous church.

808
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,460
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

809
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,280
What the hell?

810
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,600
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

811
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,820
Yes, the Christian heaven is hotter.

812
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,020
That's because there are seven suns out of seven.

813
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,420
But there's no genius hell in fun.

814
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,420
Oh, yeah, all your friends will be down there.

815
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,020
God's right.

816
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,200
God's right.

817
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200


818
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200


819
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200


820
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200


821
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,200


822
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,320
Spread the word.

823
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,160
Hey voila!

824
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,820
Yo, where'd you get to?

825
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:07,820


826
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:07,820


827
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:07,820


828
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,120
Oh, give me a game began to repaired!

829
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,120


830
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,120


831
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,720
We got that shit.

832
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:08,720


833
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:08,740
That's seconds.

834
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


835
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


836
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


837
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


838
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


839
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


840
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


841
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,060
I want toラndyt 사람�e electric smart.

842
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:12,760
Yeah.

843
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,300
But there wasn't никак nos or cash in there.

844
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,300


845
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,300


846
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,300


847
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,320
I don't think I kill somebody in the station.

848
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,400
Oh.

849
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:26,080
of truth manifested beyond transubstantial odd.

850
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:38,960
All being and non-being, neither mind nor Buddha, in all embracing imminence and itself,

851
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,000
paradoxes are unveiled.

852
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:54,480
Contradiction collapses where boundaries failed, plunging into the vortex of darkness divine,

853
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,200
entering the void where all things intertwine.

854
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,540
This is the existence of the non-existence.

855
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,800
A duality expressing the radiance of ultimate reality.

856
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:08,880
The non-existence of the non-existence.

857
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,700
The non-existence of the non-existence.

858
00:48:49,680 --> 00:49:07,560
The non-existence of the non-existence.

859
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,020
And turn the key.

860
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,460
Turn the key.

861
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,980
Throw me inside.

862
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,180
I'm not gonna wait for anyone anymore.

863
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:25,880
No.

864
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,500
I'm not gonna wait for anyone anymore.

865
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,380
No.

866
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,940
I wanna disappear.

867
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,560
I wanna disappear.

868
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:38,800


869
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,380
I wanna disappear.

870
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


871
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


872
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


873
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


874
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


875
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,380


876
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,440
Go to the proud, without the clown.

877
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,120
My grasp grows clenched against a cloud of clouds, I come down with the real and land

878
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,020
on you.

879
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,100
Once you're what we got going, you're merged to what we are doing, turn off the water

880
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,860
and start the calling.

881
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,960
broadcast on audiobook.com

882
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,900
I'll be really busy playing weird since they aren't here.

883
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,040
guitar solo

884
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,620
I'm not gonna love anyone anymore

885
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,840
I'm not gonna love anyone anymore

886
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,900
I'm gonna bury the tears so I can get out

887
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,580
And let it rot

888
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,440
Forever

889
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,800
I wonder what we got done

890
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,640
I wonder what we are doing

891
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,580
Turn off the water and stop the flow

892
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,280
Little white trees will they implode

893
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,100
And will they rise from you to go away

894
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:38,580
Ladies and gentlemen, St. Kenneth Huey.

895
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:38,880
St. Kenneth Huey.

896
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,000
All right, well, when the Popess Lilith and I

897
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,960
were first discussing what I might say to you here tonight,

898
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,380
she made one point very, very strongly to me.

899
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,680
She said, these things always go better

900
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,960
if you start out with a funny story.

901
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,060
So I went back to the old subgenius joke book,

902
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,300
and I found a little item that starts out like this.

903
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,740
Why did the chicken cross the road?

904
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,880
Why did the chicken cross the road?

905
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:08,880


906
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:08,880


907
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,340
Anybody here tonight know the answer to that?

908
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,880
That's nice.

909
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,160
That's pretty sweet, yeah.

910
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,180
But the thing of it is, to be quite frank with you,

911
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,920
I don't really give a good damn about no chickens,

912
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,360
because all I can think about is salvation.

913
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,920
That's why I've got Bob on the brain.

914
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,660
Bob on the brain.

915
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,640
Bob on the brain.

916
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,640
How many?

917
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,980
How many of you here tonight have got Bob on the brain?

918
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,720
Well, that's good.

919
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,100
Because, you know, there isn't anything more important

920
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,060
than J.R. Bob Doggs,

921
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,080
the living avatar of slack.

922
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,660
That's something they used to drill into our heads

923
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,440
every day at the subgenius school for slackers.

924
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,500
And I mean that literally.

925
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,600
Big.

926
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,520
Loud.

927
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,480
Heavy-duty industrial drills.

928
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,180
All caked up with dried blood and hair

929
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,460
and bits of bone and brain.

930
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,940
Man, I mean to tell you, I still get the worst headaches.

931
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,360
But it's worth it, because I've got Bob on the brain.

932
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,160
Bob on the brain.

933
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,480
Bob on the brain.

934
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,900
Of course, that was back in the old days.

935
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,940
For all these educational innovations you've got now,

936
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,680
like teaching and learning.

937
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,400
Yeah, you young folks today, you've got it awful sweet,

938
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,300
don't you?

939
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,760
What with your cable TV and your pornographic video games

940
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,920
and your hyper-violent internet.

941
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,020
Well, things may have been tough

942
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,120
when I was a boy.

943
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,160
But I mean to tell you, we'd sit in front of a teeny-weeny little television screen,

944
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,480
black and white TV screen, teeny-tiny little TV screen,

945
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,140
for hours.

946
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,420
And did we complain?

947
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,740
No, sirree, we liked it.

948
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Because we had Bob on the brain.

949
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,660
Bob on the brain.

950
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,360
Bob on the brain.

951
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,180
Boo!

952
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,400
Boo!

953
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,100
Boo!

954
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:38,800
Boo!

955
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:38,900
Boo!

956
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,340
Boo!

957
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:39,600
Boo!

958
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,060
Boo!

959
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:40,420
Boo!

960
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,140
Boo!

961
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:41,340
Boo!

962
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,440
Boo!

963
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:42,440


964
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,620
That was back in the 50s, you know.

965
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,520
Not long after J.R. Bob started his modern-day ministry,

966
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,000
my daddy used to like to tell a story

967
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,200
about how he came home one day,

968
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,840
after a long hard day working in the mines,

969
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,940
to find this strange smiling man sitting in the living room,

970
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,000
sitting in the living room,

971
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,260
talking to my mother,

972
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,700
who was pretty well along in the family way with me at the time.

973
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,600
And this Bob's fella, he had his sample case open,

974
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,900
brochures and vibrating G-gaws and who knows what all,

975
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,240
spread out all over the table.

976
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,260
And this Bob's fella, he was explaining to my mother

977
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:33,720
that he could guarantee her the brightest future any mother could ever dream of for her child,

978
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,200
and all it would take,

979
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:43,560
would be one extra little booster shot of his high-quality subgenius jism.

980
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,800
Now I know all you horny little subgenius monkey-spikers here tonight

981
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,880
are wondering if my parents were such a couple of knuckle-dragging morons

982
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,100
that they'd buy a load of crap like that.

983
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,680
But let me hasten to remind you that J.R. Bob Dobbs is,

984
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,120
the world's greatest salesman.

985
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,600
And if he wants to sell you a load of crap,

986
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,680
by the time he's through talking,

987
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,120
your mouth will be watering,

988
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,780
you'll be down on your knees begging for an extra heaping helping.

989
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,640
That's true.

990
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,580
So before he left the next morning,

991
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,660
Bob had signed up both of my parents for his brand new church of the subgenius,

992
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,080
and by the time I came along,

993
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,180


994
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,460
they were well established in the local clinch.

995
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,940
They'd be going from door to door,

996
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,680
witnessing,

997
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,040
visiting with the sick,

998
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,300
the lonely,

999
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,640
the elderly,

1000
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,400
the feeble-minded,

1001
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,740
peddling dope to school children.

1002
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:59,080
How I wish I could remember those fine, fine pills of Bob they used to dispense so freely.

1003
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,120
But I have,

1004
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,180
I do have many, many fond memories of growing up in the local clinch,

1005
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,680
and the church community in those days.

1006
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,400
For instance, going to subgenius summer camp every year.

1007
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:17,180
I don't suppose many of you here tonight have ever been to a real old-fashioned subgenius summer camp, have you?

1008
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,760
No, that's sad.

1009
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,680
You know, I've still got the cap I used to wear.

1010
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,500
Say, could you hand me my cap over here?

1011
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,860
Thank you kindly, sister.

1012
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,460
Bob's blessing be upon you tonight.

1013
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,720
See, it's got the picture of Bob real nice and big on the front there.

1014
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,680
You know, we used to call this the front of the cap,

1015
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,780
back before you young whippersnappers came along and realized we'd been wearing them the wrong way around all these years.

1016
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:01,620
So, all of us pink diaper babies used to love going to subgenius summer camp.

1017
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,400
I don't suppose many of you here tonight have ever heard that phrase, pink diaper babies, have you?

1018
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,420
Well, let me explain that to you.

1019
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,340
When you're a little baby, sucking on your mommy's kitty,

1020
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,000
you know you've got slack, but you don't really understand it.

1021
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,260
I mean, you're just a baby.

1022
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,080
So you might think that slack is your poopy.

1023
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,080
And the little subgenius babies, they have two different ways that they think about that.

1024
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:37,740
Some of the little subgenius babies like to spread their slack around, share it with everybody,

1025
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,700
smear it on the walls, dump it on the furniture, lob it at the cap.

1026
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:51,600
But sometimes, the little subgenius babies will feel like there's not enough slack to go around for everybody,

1027
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,580
like they've got to keep it all to themselves.

1028
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:00,200
And they'll just kind of clench up tight and grab on like it's for dear life,

1029
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,300
get all bound up.

1030
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,540
And you know that ain't healthy.

1031
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,360
So the subgenius parents, they learn this quick pretty quickly.

1032
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,660
Trick pretty quickly.

1033
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,400
You'll like this one a lot.

1034
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,880
It's very logical.

1035
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,040
I think Mr. Spock wrote it down in his Alien Baby book.

1036
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,160
What you do is when you're washing a load of the baby's diapers,

1037
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,900
you throw something red into the wash.

1038
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,260
That was pretty easy back in the 50s,

1039
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,180
because there was a red under the diaper.

1040
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:30,940
It was under every bed.

1041
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,740
And you know what happens when you pull the diapers out of the wash?

1042
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,920
They're all pink.

1043
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,840
And you put those pink diapers on the little subgenius babies,

1044
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,960
and, well, naturally, their little subgenius poop holes just turn right around

1045
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,440
and take aim just like they would at anything pink and let her rip.

1046
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,640
Steamin' hot and bloody of it.

1047
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,660
Whoa.

1048
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,380
Ken Huey, dear friends in Seattle.

1049
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,480
The pretty song you heard was Maggie, Pierce, and E.J.

1050
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:14,460
And that was Frederick Thordendal doing the Beefheartian weirdness.

1051
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,880
And, uh, thank you.

1052
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,040
Hey, hey, hey.

1053
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,660
Hey, hey.

1054
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:17,920
Uh.

1055
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,340
Hey.

1056
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:19,960
Oh.

1057
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,100
Uh.

1058
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,520
Uh.

1059
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:22,940
Uh.

1060
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:24,880
Uh.

1061
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,160
Uh.

1062
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,840
Bye now.
