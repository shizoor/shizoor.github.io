1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
What do we do? Come back like this?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey guys, wanna look for planes or something?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,900
I'm going home.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,960
Yeah, I'll come with you. Let's go listen to the radio.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,000
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,680
The Self Genius Hour of Slut.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,520
You are funny, Bob.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,380
Hey, wait a minute. There's something really ugly crawling up your shirt.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,140
That's my tie, Bob. Sorry.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,660
Oh, look out, folks. It's time for the morning traffic.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,320
Today's morning traffic report brought to you by Chateau Jason and the wine that used to play football.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,700
20 seconds.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,980
Nice meeting you.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,220
No time for jokes, okay?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
Look, the hold button says hold and the kill button is right next to it.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,200
Kill button? I just came in for a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,020
10 seconds. Better put your headphones on.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,520
Hey, wait a second. You want me to go on the radio?

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,940
That's very funny. Good luck.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,240
Oh, yes, dear friends. It's rerun time again, and this is a good one.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,000
Hour of Slut number 724 from early 2000.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,160
This was one of the very last shows that I mastered on cassette tape

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,460
because we went all digital after this one.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,140
It's also one of the first shows I did after moving from Dallas to Cleveland

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,980
and taking up residence on Chaz Smith's show,

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,840
ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB at Cleveland State.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,020
This intercuts some killer stuff from the 1999 X-Day revival

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,380
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra and me preaching,

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,860
and it features excellent UFO-oriented collages from our old album,

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,000
Media Barrage No. 11, which was remastered to CD about that time.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,280
And there's lots of music, including some period Todd Rundgren,

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,860
and things vastly less well-known like the church itself.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,860
As I record these sentences on June 1st, conspiracy year so-called 2020,

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,700
the last sentence of John Bruner's The Sheep Look Up has come true.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,180
That smell is America burning.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,840
But not us. Not yet, anyway.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,300
We're burning only with the desire.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,160
We're burning with the desire to share our slack with you.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,240
So let's use this fine rerun to go back in time

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,200
to the comparatively idyllic and utopian year of 2000.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,520
Oh, if only we'd known how good we already had it then.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,820
We invite you to participate in a program designed to help you find a richer, more productive life.

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,680
Talk Radio is about sharing your concerns and problems

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,100
and helping to find answers through creative solutions.

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,100
And now, you better wake up.

46
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,060
It's late.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,360
It's late.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
It's late.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,120
250,000 K, the impact.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,100
Another quarter million projected within the year.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Enter.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,900
Come on, just push enter and it's done.

53
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,560
Which is it gonna be?

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:32,980
Hmm?

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,100
And uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day!

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,120
We want you people to dance into the new century.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,640
Screw into the new century.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,140
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover is what you'll be doing forever.

60
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,360
So make sense.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
Make sure you're not asleep.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
Make sure you're not watching TV.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,300
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,600
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch you'll never be able to scratch.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,240
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

66
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,620
A sea of Bob's pills.

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,300
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to see them.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
I believe you 100%.

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,220
Look into my eyes.

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,940
I always tell the truth.

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,320
I believe you.

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,140
Now just calm down.

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,980
The stars are blue-shifting.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,460
They're heading back in at a phenomenal rate.

75
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,440
Yes, we know what's happening as far as the blue shift.

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,860
Everyone is warm.

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,160
The whole universe is gonna end in about 14 hours.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,420
No, no.

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,060
All contingencies have been planned for.

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,440
Calm down.

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,920
You're looking to be evident.

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,740
I got the data right here.

83
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,440
All contingencies have been taken care of.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,620
Everything has gelled.

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,160
The positive response has occurred.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Oh, good.

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
No, no, no, no, no.

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,100
Wait, wait.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,840
Don't, don't.

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,360
Shhh.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,720
Shhh.

92
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm gonna put it in.

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
What are we gonna do?

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,940
How are we gonna get it back in here?

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
It just disappeared.

96
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,500
What are we gonna do now?

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,880
He did a little blue sparkly flashy thing and he was gone.

98
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,980
I think he was...

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,320
Look at that.

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,140
I think he was doing Elvis and his blue spangly thing.

101
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,420
My God.

102
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:13,600
Period.

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,380
Those fools.

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,200
Look.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
I warned the fools.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,980
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,100
He was wearing snow shoes.

108
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,880
Look at the Earth.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,220
It's gonna be so hard to make it through that little thing.

110
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,940
My God.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,140
It's the blue flame.

112
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,760
No, he's wearing one of those little hairy hats.

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,120
It's that fire.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,040
Those fools.

120
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,160
No, no, no.

121
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,200
No, she shouldn't have his hat.

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,400
Those fools.

123
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,900
I warned those fools.

124
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,340
Oh, my God.

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,920
No.

126
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,660
They set fire to the atmosphere.

127
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,740
Blowing up plutonium and other things.

128
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,880
Well, that was different, but now they've set fire to hydrogen.

129
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,040
The whole atmosphere just peeled away.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,020
Those fools.

131
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,700
Those poor, poor fools.

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,020
And also it's Pirates Galore, an excellent view of the future in which every

133
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,100
person is a part of the future.

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


135
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


136
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


138
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


139
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


141
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


142
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


143
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,100


144
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,320
Everything and everyone you know is completely tied up backwards.

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,060
I can't see a damn thing anymore until all the lights are out.

146
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,520
And at 7 o'clock, it's Mom's Poultry Penance, where Mom gets down on hands and

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,820
knees and makes Dad satisfied like he used to be back when he had teeth.

148
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,620
It's Terrence McSquacken singing songs about cars and a man with an exploding foot.

149
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,800
So don't miss the adventure as tomorrow Tim carries on the Master Semi.

150
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,080
Here's to the best.

151
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm on the line.

152
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,320
You're on the line.

153
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm on the line.

154
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,620
We have about 38 hours of oxygen left in the ship.

155
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,080
Yes, but we still believe, Commandante.

156
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,140
Is it not most important that we believe?

157
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,380
If we believe perhaps the-

158
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,440
The only thing that I can tell you to team the ship out-

159
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,040
You're going to what?

160
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,420
You're going toward the sun.

161
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,020
You're going to point the ship at the sun?

162
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Yes.

163
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,900
A long-point ship at the sun.

164
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,840
You are going to point the ship at the sun?

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,460
I can't breathe. I'm having problems with this noxious...

166
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,520
What do we do?

167
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,860
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

168
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,060
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

169
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,960
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

170
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,900
Bounding fathers and mothers left us a mandate.

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
We've got to separate the church and the state.

172
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,620
So get your head straight before it's too late and you drop it in the plate.

173
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,540
You must appreciate Jesus and money.

174
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,400
Make a man speak in tongues, scream out his lungs.

175
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,600
Roll in the dung and when the song is sung, he moves up another rung.

176
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,360
And the deaf and the dumb are the ones who get stung.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Here come the sex police. They're at your bedroom door.

178
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
Moving in next door.

179
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
Searching from floor to floor.

180
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,860
You know what they're looking for.

181
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,240
Someone's always keeping score.

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
Every time you tick the oar.

183
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Love isn't fun no more.

184
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,780
Love isn't fun no more.

185
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Love isn't fun no more.

186
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,340
Love isn't fun no more.

187
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,260
Passion's Christ!

188
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,760
Come to the gospel.

189
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,080
Passion's Christ!

190
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,600
Come to the Easter.

191
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Passion's Christ!

192
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
Come to the holy house.

193
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,000
Come to the Easter.

194
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,020
Passion's Christ! Come to the Easter.

195
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,960
Passion's Christ! Come to the Easter.

196
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,900
Passion's Christ! Come to the Easter.

197
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,640
Passion's Christ! Come to the Easter.

198
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,480
Passion's Christ! Come to the Easter.

199
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,640
Come to the Easter.

200
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,900
Let's get fundamental about this strange philosophy

201
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,900
in which God and man are enemies, in which there is no serenity.

202
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,000
Unless you have a little bit of reason to believe.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Believe precisely what they want you to believe

204
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,740
And no diversity

205
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,560
Come join the army and learn the noises

206
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,280
That drown out the other's voices

207
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,160
And please the devil who rejoices

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
When mankind has no choices

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
And power exploits us

210
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,060
And peace avoids us

211
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,820
Guess who to the rescue

212
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,320
On our holy mission

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
To uphold the tradition

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,340
Of the Spanish Inquisition

215
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,460
And create your decision

216
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,880
By forcing your confession

217
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,340
Now let that be a lesson

218
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,680
Who do you think you're messing with?

219
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,860
Who do you think you're messing with?

220
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Flash is bright

221
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,760
Come to the rescue

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
Flash is bright

223
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,540
Come to the rescue

224
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,920
Flash is bright

225
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,080
Come to the rescue

226
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,460
You've been at all times

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
Here he comes

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,980
Flash is bright

229
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:56,980


230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,460
Flash is bright

231
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,900
Come to the rescue

232
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
Flash is bright

233
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,820
Come to the rescue

234
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,180
Flash is bright

235
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,620
Come to the rescue

236
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,040
Because I believe in you

237
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
Thank you.

238
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,320
Thank you.

239
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,880
Thank you.

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Thank you.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Thank you.

242
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,260
Thank you.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,640
Thank you.

244
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,800
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

245
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,280
as those which were first called flying saucers

246
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,540
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

247
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,900
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

248
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,980
By 1950,

249
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,980
some of these characters

250
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,820
were beginning to spin their stories of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

251
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,040
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

252
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,360
Suddenly everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room

253
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
where nobody was listening to me.

254
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,440
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone

255
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,180
and not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

256
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,880
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

257
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,140
and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

258
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,020
with lights flashing off rhythmically.

259
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,960
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes

260
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,440
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

261
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,820
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

262
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,100
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

263
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,540
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

264
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,920
And they didn't say anything.

265
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,900
They just kept flashing those lights at me

266
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,540
and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

267
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,440
And the man with the funny head,

268
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,920
the leader,

269
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,660
the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

270
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,760
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church?

271
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,980
And where's your wallet?

272
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,120
The DC-9 pushed the button.

273
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,360
Yeah.

274
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,520
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't really a dream

275
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,240
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

276
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,040
And suddenly it all came back to me.

277
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,700
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

278
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,380
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me

279
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,420
and made me do this.

280
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,720
And talk.

281
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,360
And talk.

282
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,400
It's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

283
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,760
And talk.

284
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,020
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

285
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,540
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

286
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

287
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,460
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

288
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,320
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

289
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,040
I hate them with all my heart.

290
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

291
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,880
What is your objective?

292
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,160
You're an opera.

293
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,960
But we will still save you.

294
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,940
In your quest for self-destruction, you will send up more satellites.

295
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,000
And we will be there waiting to come again.

296
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,140
In the cycle to the moon, we're right.

297
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,300
And they came, one by one.

298
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,820
I'll be right here.

299
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,080
I'll be right here.

300
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,420
I was first contacted by...

301
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,120
a being from the planet Mars.

302
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,820
Now, this man was invisible to me,

303
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,280
except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

304
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:14,320
By 1998, every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie

305
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,460
is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

306
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,800
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

307
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,300
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

308
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,660
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

309
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Perhaps...

310
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,360
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

311
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,020
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

312
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,240
But for the fact that many of Nostradamus' other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

313
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,420
But the only...

314
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,620
ones are coming back.

315
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm going to let them through.

316
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,860
We are here.

317
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,200
Where are you from?

318
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,100
I don't like his feet.

319
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
Let me feed you a little pork.

320
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,080
He's trying to tell us something.

321
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,900
And Banjo...

322
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,320
And Birdie...

323
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,440
And Bob...

324
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Good.

325
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,280
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with Bob.

326
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,920
What you steal will happen.

327
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:36,540
We banished the

328
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:36,680
and the

329
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,660
and the

330
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,420
and the

331
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,980
and the

332
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,120
and the

333
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,160
and the

334
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,160


335
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,000
and the

336
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,080
and the

337
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,400
and the

338
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
and the

339
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,020
and the

340
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,340
scientifically magic implements. There'd be stalls of technology that would be too much for us to handle.

341
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,400
In one instant all the hangovers would disappear, along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

342
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,460
But in return the human race will have to take on living machinery so complex that those it is peaceful.

343
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,700
The end result would be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

344
00:19:48,700 --> 00:20:06,940
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of world leadership to explain humanity's behavior to the Exus in ways they can understand so they don't put us out of our misery with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

345
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,740
The right people, us, must be the ones that the Exus make into superhuman overmen.

346
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,680
And even then things will be damn tough for the rest of the world.

347
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:18,680


348
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,900
And we'll have to wait and see what happens in this period, which is called the Time and Half Time.

349
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:41,480
The Exus have landed Earth's under their control

350
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,680
Dobbs' vision spans through the sky

351
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,680


352
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,700
The cities, radioactive holes

353
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,960
We don't know what their game is

354
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,800
But their name is unpronounceable

355
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,820
We don't know what they came for

356
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
But what they aim for

357
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,580
Is impossible

358
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,460
But is there not any peace

359
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,380
In the second year before the millennium of the day of God?

360
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:40,680
Come Wednesday, as in the twinkling of an eye, they will come among the Yakutism, which are like unto thy great white brothers.

361
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,480
They come as men, as grave and indigenous,

362
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,240
As a war and wind, and as a cloud, and they are now the heavens, working over thee.

363
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,420
The Exus have landed their machines

364
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,120
Following our tracks

365
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,680
Dobbs' vision stands proven

366
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,440
A world without slack.

367
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,600
A world without slack.

368
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,600


369
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,700
So, don't come up to me saying,

370
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:31,720
Oh Reverend Stang, I spent my thirty dollars, I went to the subgenius show, I saw all the preachings, heard all the bands, but I didn't get slack.

371
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,020
Where's my slack? Give me my slack.

372
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,540
My friend, if that's the way you're thinking, then you never heard anything Bob said.

373
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
You never understood a word he wrote in the book of the subgenius.

374
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,420
Because the day that we can sell you slack,

375
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,480
Is the day the conspiracy has won.

376
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,960
You make your own slack.

377
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,520
Bob is not the answer, but neither is anything else.

378
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,460
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

379
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,900
Question authority, or else, and

380
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,920
Mount them.

381
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,300
Can't take a joke.

382
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,020
Praise Bob.

383
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,440
Tell me somebody.

384
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,500
Good night.

385
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

386
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,020
Einstein, secret archer, grand.

387
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,220
Mildred, chef.

388
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Beyond the soft.

389
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,640
If I don't get you no more in this world, I'll see you in the next one.

390
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,340
And don't be late.

391
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,240
Praise Bob.

392
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,040
Hey, guess what?

393
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,680
That website, when we...

394
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,840
Here's the entire result of being in Time Magazine

395
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,020
for Churches of Genius, okay?

396
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Amazing thing.

397
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,820
We finally, we met in Time Magazine,

398
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,500
and our website's URL was...

399
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,720
Milk it, baby, milk it, milk it, baby.

400
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,320
The big result, the final end result was

401
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,600
our merchant credit card company

402
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,320
quit doing business with us.

403
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,760
Wow.

404
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,940
Having looked at the website and discovered

405
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,020
that there was, quote,

406
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,580
questionable material, unquote.

407
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,040
So, Jesus...

408
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,620
Fat naked people in a swimming pool at Brushwood?

409
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,300
Yeah, Jesus had to call up...

410
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,620
That is always questionable.

411
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,700
...a new bank.

412
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
We had to find a pornographer's bank

413
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,840
that would do anything for a buck.

414
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,480
Praise Bob and God bless.

415
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:42,900
Bless America,

416
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,420
where there's still people who do anything for a buck

417
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,380
and understand the values.

418
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,320
You're on the air with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

419
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,080
Oh, you were complaining about the One World Advertiser.

420
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,220
I think it's a fine little giveaway paper

421
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,800
I find on my doorstep.

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,540
Every day.

423
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,420
The One World Paperboy throws it in here.

424
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,280
Look, over here.

425
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,240
One Church of the Subgenius for sale.

426
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,540
What?

427
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah.

428
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,480
It's on page three of the One World Advertiser.

429
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,500
Underneath the garage sale listings and the lost kitties.

430
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,100
Well, the Church of the Subgenius has been willing to sell out for a long time.

431
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,880
It's in the shopper.

432
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,280
They haven't had any buyers yet.

433
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,260
Man, if you get it in the shopper, that means it's definitely going down.

434
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,260
Those guys, they're very anxious to jump the story,

435
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,700
as they say in those local news...

436
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,520
Market analysis summary.

437
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,840
The subgenius market is not restricted by age, gender, belief system,

438
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,060
or even international boundaries.

439
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,040
Anybody might be interested.

440
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,960
The majority of our members fall in males 18 to 25.

441
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,140
Above average intelligence.

442
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,080
Computer literate and somewhat rebellious.

443
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,420
That's not what this says.

444
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,700
It says almost free to good home.

445
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,540
And then tape jacks.

446
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:59,300
Sounds like a good profile of hackers who may have attacked the sites over the last few days.

447
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,260
I don't know if they got the profile.

448
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,180
They got, you know, John Douglas.

449
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,660
You mean they might all be in this together?

450
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,520
The same people that knocked down those sites?

451
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,120
Can you imagine the FBI profile?

452
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,940
I think no one called up Talk of the Nation today and claimed that they were in the same group.

453
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:10,940


454
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:10,940


455
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,200
The Church of the Subgenius had something to do with that.

456
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah.

457
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,980
Figures.

458
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,020
Wouldn't that be a funny joke?

459
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,380
As long as they spelled the name right in the newspaper.

460
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,740
Well, you know, it's funny, because back in 1982,

461
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,380
the world's first Macintosh virus was blamed on the Church of the Subgenius.

462
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,840
It was a lie.

463
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,800
A lie!

464
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,560
Because it was a peace message.

465
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Well, that is the reason why the genetic spawn that you have from fornicating apples have ruined mankind.

466
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,880
And have...

467
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,460
That's why we have to leave.

468
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,620
...ruined our business structure, have ruined the social infrastructure and our cultural beliefs.

469
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,640
Look at what it's become!

470
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,000
It's, you know, it destroyed everything with that...

471
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
It's like the story of Para-Ubu, like the absurdity of mankind.

472
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,240
Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,620
Yeah, yeah, it's like that!

474
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,660
Yeah, it's full of irony, like art and all that shit.

475
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,920
Yeah!

476
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,140
Yeah, art's got irony in it, and it's got, um, what's that other stuff?

477
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,560
Uh, luminin.

478
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,240
Torture.

479
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,980
Torture!

480
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,380
It's got luninum, torture, it's got irony, it's got, uh, what, it did a little, uh, vapor...

481
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,240
What are you talking, what are we talking about, the Earth or the society, or...

482
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,000
Greasy fried chicken.

483
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got it.

484
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,080
What we don't like about it, what we can't stand about it.

485
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,100
No, we're talking about, you know, this right here, under...

486
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,560
These tubes of fried chicken, though, just aren't the same.

487
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,740
These ones?

488
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Yeah.

489
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,920
Well, what do you have to compare them with, man?

490
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,880
You know, come on, come on, these are the only ones you're getting here.

491
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,240
I mean, to me, fried chicken wasn't something that you squeezed out of a tube.

492
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,200
Not in the old days.

493
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,160
To me, it was something that you, you know, you, you, that came in little nuggets, these

494
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
bite-sized nuggets.

495
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,560
Yeah.

496
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,200
You know, and you just, you had a handful of them, and you shoved them in, and they

497
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,580
had crispy stuff on them.

498
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:50,880
Yeah.

499
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,460
That's a chicken.

500
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,700
You could imagine them as, like, little deep fried products.

501
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,200
But, I mean, the stuff, they're coming out of tubes, that's just, that's not a real chicken.

502
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,820
Well, it does have a very, very chickeny rich smell, doesn't it?

503
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,340
Yeah, and, and, uh, tomatoes, these, this, this, this stuff in the tube, tomatoes didn't

504
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,020
come out of a tube.

505
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I remember tomatoes were these perfect, hard things.

506
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,220
Yeah.

507
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,000
That, that were always, that always were really shiny.

508
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,340
Right.

509
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,480
Well, they were really just round tubes.

510
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,220
They didn't have any taste.

511
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,540
They were round tubes with no taste.

512
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah.

513
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,380
But those were real, and chickens, remember chickens, they were these boneless creatures

514
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,880
that were, had their feet grown into the cage.

515
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,360
Boneless tubes.

516
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,360


517
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,540
Yeah, real chickens.

518
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,780
They had no heads, they were cloned, and that's the way chicken was meant to taste, rich and

519
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,040
greasy like mom used to make.

520
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,680
It's like, this modern, they have, this so-called progress has, I think, in some ways, yes,

521
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,300
I dare to say it, it is taking us, yes, backwards.

522
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Oh, we agree.

523
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,960
Backwards, not forwards.

524
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,520
Don't we, Chas?

525
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,580
Agree completely?

526
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,480
We're revolutionists.

527
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,140
It's almost like, it's almost as if.

528
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,240
21st century, daddy-o.

529
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,100
Come on.

530
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,520
This is just now occurring to me.

531
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,260
Well, look, here, put it together.

532
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,460
The evolution.

533
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:54,360
The internet, the internet has been attacked, so people are unhappy with the future world.

534
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,060
Soon the infrastructure will fall.

535
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,220
Oh, just, just a few, a few, and this is happening.

536
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,840
And the ratings have come in, and the oldies music station.

537
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,060
The radio station in town here that plays oldies music from the 50s and the 60s, a much

538
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,280
simpler time.

539
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,080
Yeah, you could, you could, it's like.

540
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,840
When we could kill students in the campuses.

541
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,120
Right.

542
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,380
And get away with it.

543
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah.

544
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
Um, but.

545
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,020
Yeah, they might be.

546
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,120
The oldies station is the number one station by far in the ratings.

547
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:29,060
So people are listening to oldies music, attacking websites, and, uh, you know, what else is happening?

548
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,620
You know.

549
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,120
Oh, dear friends, I'll tell you what's happening.

550
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,780
Credits.

551
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,060
Credits are happening.

552
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,260
Uh, what we heard from the very beginning.

553
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,260


554
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:45,920
Of show was show from KPFA in Berkeley, puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell, uh, bits and pieces

555
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,380
there.

556
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,140
Um, some, some Bob lines.

557
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,260
We've been listening to clips from the double X day, 1999 D Vival at Brushwood.

558
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,740
Uh, that's a new CD.

559
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,600
X day 99 D Vival is a new CD.

560
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,600
And I've been playing little bits and pieces that with Einstein secret orchestra in the

561
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:05,940
background.

562
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,820
And you're truly preaching.

563
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,580
And of course we've been hearing lots of the, uh, ESO radio show.

564
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,940
Einstein secret orchestra, swamp radio out of WCSB in Cleveland, which is, um, essentially

565
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,400
where I'm producing the show.

566
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,940
But although I'm not going into the studio yet and doing that, I go into the studio for

567
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:31,280
Chaz's show on Thursday nights and you can call in at WCSB, uh, in Cleveland, uh, at

568
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,180
lonesome cowboy day.

569
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,800
Five.

570
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes.

571
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
The mighty Dave.

572
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,220
Uh, keeping us all off track.

573
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,620
Uh, don't you see?

574
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:50,640
And, uh, fascist Christ was the name of that song by Todd Rundgren from his no world order

575
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,160
album.

576
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,080
Remember that?

577
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,540
Uh, Oh, the Danish or Norwegian song.

578
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,220
His talking prayer is by me.

579
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,980
Thought time.

580
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,160
And the music that you're hearing in the background is amorphous.

581
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,880
Amorphous.

582
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,740
Uh, friends.

583
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:21,520
And what we've heard quite a bit of is the old subgenius media barrage number 11, uh,

584
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,660
with the UFOs collage, where we heard a G Gordon Gordon in space, a lot of collage from

585
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,320
me and Doug Wellman of puzzling evidence and Byron Werner.

586
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,760
Who has a new show on internet radio.

587
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,920
Check out luxuriamusic.com.

588
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,140
One word luxuriamusic, luxuriamusic.com.

589
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Uh, and a buck naked, the former subgenius preacher.

590
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,980
He disavowed the church.

591
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,340
He found a new, another religion, some rival cult.

592
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,980
He won't tell us what it is.

593
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,000
Uh, doing the excess have landed.

594
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,820
Also off the old media barrage number 11 and friends.

595
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,480
Hey, yes.

596
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm going to be a little more serious.

597
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,020
I don't know what I want to say, but I'm going to be.

598
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,880
I'm going to be.

599
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:48,880


600
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,760
So I'm going to be.

601
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,700
Okay.

602
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,620
See you guys.

603
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,300
I'll see you guys.

604
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,880
Bye bye.

605
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,080


606
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,100
Bye.

607
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,980
Bye.

608
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


609
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


610
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


611
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


612
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


613
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


614
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


615
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


616
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


617
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


618
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


619
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


620
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


621
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:01,980


622
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,820
I'm not a human, son

623
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,460
It's a sound, not a voice

624
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,840
It's insensical

625
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,680
Turn yourself on

626
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,020
And build yourself up

627
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,080
Who'll be fresh?

628
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,200
Who'll be fresh?

629
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,120
I have been lost

630
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,840
This occasion

631
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,800
What a thing, what a thing

632
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,300
They turn into one in a minute

633
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,980
Oh, oh, oh

634
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,380
A.R.S.

635
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,220
To the word they pledge

636
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,380
It's insensical

637
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,960
To the word they pledge

638
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,780
To the word they pledge

639
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,500
I see you talking

640
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,200
But I still can't hear

641
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,440
Like a box of glass

642
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,740
Poking up my ears

643
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,980
Turn off the charm

644
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,500
And pray on your ears

645
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,160
Who'll be fresh?

646
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,120
Who'll be fresh?

647
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,760
Who'll be fresh?

648
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,060
The earth is always

649
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,320
fresh

650
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,060
But I just won't

651
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,220
stay

652
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,220


653
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,220


654
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,220


655
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,860
I'd always

656
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,500
foolish

657
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,420
But I just won't

658
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,340
stay

659
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,020
Queer

660
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,520
Deceived

661
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,660
Rejected

back the pokeballs the pokeballs yeah

681
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,880
they're very commercial they're on now

682
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,000
requesting that you return the Pokemon

683
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,940
ball oh yeah that's true pokeballs

visas are it's over that's the Pokemon

687
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,260
themselves are the mind control devices

688
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,920
we need a perfect marketing point that

689
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,300
the children by these they keep them

690
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,800
long enough and the the tones that

691
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,500
emanate from them help to take over

692
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,160
their minds and when they return the

693
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,540
ball they think that this music is the

694
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,700
antidote yes music this show is the

695
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,700
antidote a program always comedy I would

Right.

772
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,820
The fairies.

773
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,340
They're bad fairies.

774
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:28,800
Bad.

775
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,840
But what about the...

776
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,800
They're like from the dark side.

777
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,860
What about the fates?

778
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,080
They're little Darth Vaders.

779
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,120
What if the fates won't speak to us?

780
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,320
They're like those wings.

781
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,900
What if, like, the fates turn their back on us?

782
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,720
Like, we want to talk to one of the muses...

783
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,580
The fates are neutral.

784
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,380
They're like Switzerland.

785
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,400
Huh?

786
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,860
Well, the fates are neutral.

787
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,600
They're like Switzerland.

788
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,080
They're just the messengers.

789
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,580
Here, buddy.

790
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,180
Good at banking and stuff.

791
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,280
This is the way it's going to be.

792
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,340
Heroin addicts.

793
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,660
Yeah.

794
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,640
That's the fates.

795
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:51,880
Swiss.

796
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,720
The cheese...

797
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,820
And the fairies are cool.

798
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,600
You know, the fairies, you get good peanut butter.

799
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,500
You know?

800
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,060
They should.

801
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,680
I mean, if that was in the job description, at least, I'd want to go for it.

802
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,960
What do fairies have to do with peanut butter?

803
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,320
You're losing, man.

804
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,760
I was following it.

805
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,600
Or unionism.

806
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,400
Peanut butter.

807
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,640
Man, come on.

808
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,320
I thought we were talking about, you know, Tinkerbell.

809
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,320
I thought we were talking about, you know, workers' rights and stuff, man.

810
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,620
I thought we were talking about how good-looking Tinkerbell was in that little outfit.

811
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,580
That's where we started.

812
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,140
Covered in peanut butter, man.

813
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,280
Imagine licking that peanut butter off.

814
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,540
Oh, we better stop talking about...

815
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,760
Sex with Tinkerbell.

816
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,220
Oh, my God.

817
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,920
Look down in the basement.

818
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,400
Sex?

819
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,980
What do you mean?

820
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,280
I was talking about having dinner with Tinkerbell.

821
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,080
Oh, my God.

822
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,520
That's not...

823
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,140
She would probably taste like chicken.

824
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,300
I was...

825
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,120
You know, it's today.

826
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,000
It's modern morality.

827
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,620
I'm shrinking.

828
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,760
I was watching that South Park movie.

829
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,740
It was a big hit movie last year.

830
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
I finally had a chance to rent it.

831
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,740
I rented it.

832
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,700
And was watching that movie.

833
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
And in the first ten minutes, I thought...

834
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:52,980
Jesus.

835
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,480
Now, what if...

836
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,140
If an old man like me heard it while I hear this is a famous big movie.

837
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,200
Everybody's going to see it.

838
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,960
It's the biggest hit movie.

839
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,260
I'm going to go see it.

840
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,900
He goes and watches people standing in line.

841
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,500
He watches people standing in line.

842
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,500
Actually, I thought it was a hilarious movie.

843
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,220
I loved it.

844
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,800
I thought it was great.

845
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,160
Brilliant.

846
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,460
Wish I'd thought of it.

847
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,080
But...

848
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,260
To another old man like myself, he'd walk in there and he'd go,

849
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,040
They're lining up and paying $10 a ticket to watch stick figures say...

850
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,160
Stick.

851
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,380
Man.

852
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,500
Which is...

853
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,620
It's stick figures talking dirt.

854
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,760
Let's go back to Tinkerbell.

855
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,020
Saying four letter...

856
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,340
What a Sunday afternoon for the family.

857
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,280
...and Alice in Wonderland.

858
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,160
On the basis, on the face of it, it's stick figures cussing.

859
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,900
What has this world devolved down into?

860
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,260
That's just motion pictures.

861
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,540
I told you they wouldn't last.

862
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,980
That's why they last?

863
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,760
A hundred years ago, I told you...

864
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,140
Motion pictures are transitional.

865
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,300
Yeah, it's just a fad.

866
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,020
Movement is transitional, Daddy-o.

867
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,560
I mean, just think of it, man.

868
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,400
I don't know what it's coming to now.

869
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,660
So the fad is coming to an end.

870
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,520
Pretty soon, we'll all be still as doorknobs.

871
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:53,520


872
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,620
You know what I'm saying?

873
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,400
It's going...

874
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,260
Movies are going...

875
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,680
Movies...

876
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,340
Movement is transitional.

877
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,120
The fad of movement...

878
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,840
The fad of movement...

879
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,100
Movement is a fad, man.

880
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,020
Just think of it.

881
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,820
We're all going to be still as a...

882
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:09,080
You know, it is a transitional, ephemeral fad compared to the amount of time...

883
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,280
We spend still.

884
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,860
...during which there has been no movement.

885
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,520
Before we was born and after we was dead.

886
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,500
But when there is no movement, is there time?

887
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:21,740
If there's nothing, no duration across which an event occurs, can one say that time has passed?

888
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,500
Well, we would only say that time can only last.

889
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,500


890
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:23,960
It could be measured.

891
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,640
The fads of movement...

892
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,820
But I can always tell you when the gas has been passed around the studio.

893
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,960
Or at least change of some kind.

894
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:30,660
If there's no movement...

895
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:30,920
Or on the road.

896
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,780
The inert gas?

897
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,420
...no change, then...

898
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,100
Someone has been passing inert gases on the road again, and I don't think it's Fermi or

899
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,720
Albert Einstein.

900
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,440
I don't like...

901
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,180
If you fart in your car and no one else smells it, did you really fart?

902
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,060
I wonder if Einstein thought about that.

903
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,660
But if there's five bandmates in a van and somebody farts, then you say fart on the air.

904
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,140
Hey, everybody.

905
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,640
Guess what time it is.

906
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Time for fun.

907
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:53,500
Time for fun.

908
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,800
So, everybody...

909
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,020
Join in and have some fun.

910
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,340
My name is Hemaroy Rogers and these are my Roy toys.

911
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,700
We hope that you have had some fun.

912
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,260
We know that we sure did.

913
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,200
My name is Hemaroy Rogers and these are my Roy toys.

914
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,500
We hope that you have had some fun.

915
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,500


916
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,500


917
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,500


918
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,500


919
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,240
So we think that's not fun.

920
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,300
Hey everybody, come on, have some fun!

921
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:40,120
My name is Nimaroy Rogers, and these are my roys, boys.

922
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,820
I think that it would be fun to kill them all today.

923
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,340
I'm gonna kill them all with my bare hands.

924
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,180
People are impacted.

925
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,540
People have to get past it, you're right.

926
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,160
We have to grow up and move on and eat our Popeye's spinach.

927
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,560
Yes, a huge mass, looking almost like a detached beard, right?

928
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,800
A huge dripping handful of seaweed, always when Popeye pulled it down.

929
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,500
Uncooked, out of the can, and dropped it into his toothless mouth,

930
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,840
and his huge, bulgurous jaw would chew it.

931
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,980
And the Adam's apple prominently distend, as the work of alimentation was robustly caricatured.

932
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,820
Finally, the morphological muscular elongation with pictorial iconic accompaniment,

933
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:44,460
together with the mechanization or superhuman function of the body,

934
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,660
the fight,

935
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:46,980
the syndrome,

936
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,660
is begun, and of course the familiar musical accompaniment that we all know.

937
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,840
What is this?

938
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,640
It's the dissolution of the Mapes Hotel in Reno, Nevada.

939
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,760
It's the death of Bob Squire, the master of political imagery.

940
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,360
What was that again, Squire?

941
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,220
Bob Squire died this week.

942
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,740
The resurrection process has an unfortunate...

943
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:11,300
Oh, also, yeah, we did want to bring up, what we wanted to tell you was all the lines of all the movies,

944
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,660
so you don't have any bad surprises when you go see the movies.

945
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,360
Don't I told you not to tell me?

946
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,440
Things like the blonde did it.

947
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,560
Not to play that song.

948
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,780
All of the cells in your body will stop.

949
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,340
Or the person you think did it, did it.

950
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,780
A kind of organic stare.

951
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,080
Or all the passengers did it.

952
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,120
Or he puts her on the plane.

953
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,000
He dies on the bus.

954
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,060
He dies in the freezing water.

955
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,220
She falls from the bell tower.

956
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,300
She shoots him in the paper.

957
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,300
Oh my goodness.

958
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,620
This is confusing.

959
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,560
It's like Thorazin.

960
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,200
He cuts off his genitals.

961
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,520
The stab, this dwarf stabs him.

962
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:39,880
Ouch.

963
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,400
His mom has been hypnotized.

964
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,080
Hey, don't say nothing about my mama.

965
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,340
He turns to the doctor.

966
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


967
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


968
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


969
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


970
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


971
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,340


972
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
He turns back into a half-wit.

973
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,260
That's my favorite.

974
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,900
How about a three-quarters wit?

975
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,220
He blows up the bridge.

976
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,300
He drives off the bridge.

977
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,660
He pushes the man off the cliff.

978
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,020
They drive into the Grand Canyon.

979
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,100
She wasn't really dead.

980
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,100
He wasn't really dead.

981
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,420
Don't look under the bed.

982
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,560
Don't look under the bed.

983
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,960
That's on the Disney Channel.

984
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,540
Top of the world, Ma.

985
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,300
What's that from?

986
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:04,760
Top of the world.

987
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,460
That's to the end of White Heat with James Cagney.

988
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,840
He blows up the giant refinery tank that he's standing on top of.

989
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,440
Yep.

990
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,320
The jigger is on the top of the world.

991
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,320


992
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,320


993
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,320


994
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,380
The gigolo gets the motel.

995
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,780
The hooker gets the millionaire.

996
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,420
Kevin Spacey gets his.

997
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,420
Glenn Close gets hers.

998
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,520
Uh-oh, we're in space, you know.

999
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,580
Where no one can hear you squee-ee-e-e-e-eil.

1000
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,620
In the eternal silences of infinite space.

1001
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,840
.

1002
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,340
It's the gods and monsters show.

1003
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,640
It's all wet and damp and squelchy and swampy and sloppy.

1004
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,140
Like the bathroom at Cafe This.

1005
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,980
And the rain drips from the branches.

1006
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:04,760
Oh, thanks.

1007
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,500
Now the pralines are here and they just dump them off next to the bus in the back.

1008
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,460
The station's full of them.

1009
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,480
One ton o' pralines.

1010
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,660
And they're rather sugary.

1011
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,400
And up there goes a little Rice Krispies.

1012
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,700
Just put out a loot.

1013
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,300
Boys, aren't you being just a little bit silly?

1014
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,240
That's Dr. Howell and Buzzing Evidence on the KPFA show.

1015
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:33,280
A particular one from January 27th of the year 2000.

1016
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:40,180
Before that, Hemeroy Rogers, the tail end of his CD, which you can find on mp3.com.

1017
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,120
You can order that CD.

1018
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,460
That's mp3.com.

1019
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,000
You can buy it through mp3.com.

1020
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,520
And I think...

1021
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,380
He didn't put it on this letter.

1022
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,080
What does he think I am, a genius?

1023
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,700
This is the church of the subgenius.

1024
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,560
It's...

1025
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,640
But it's Hemer...

1026
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,780
I believe it's something like...

1027
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,120
You go to the mp3.com and just, you know, search for Hemeroy Rogers.

1028
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,040
And his roid boys.

1029
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,880
And, of course, Einstein.

1030
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,360
Einstein's secret orchestra.

1031
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,900
Where we never shut up.

1032
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,920
But, but, but, friends.

1033
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,240
Actually, we should have scary music.

1034
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,500
But, because they're scary...

1035
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,120
These are the predictions for the coming years.

1036
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,020
Monsters like unto men will be around thee all about.

1037
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,800
And shall wait thee to look past the door which should be locked.

1038
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,220
And thy sciences will terrify thee and bring thee naught but devils.

1039
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:52,280
For thine spirit is locked away inside the white stone.

1040
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,340
Which my angels saw grew from space.

1041
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Which is the vessel of all that is nerd.

1042
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,200
And even now I shall feed science in the heaven and science in the earth.

1043
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,920
Blood belches from the earth.

1044
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,780
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

1045
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:19,320
The children of heaven and the angels from hell are among thee spreading lies and deception.

1046
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,960
They turn not as they go.

1047
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:22,840
They...

1048
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,460
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

1049
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,800
Blasel, you have earned this!

1050
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,140
Yeah!

1051
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,200
They do it their way.

1052
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:50,100
As the mutants move, that leaps Tibetan Tiger Man.

1053
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,120
What about, uh, what about this, uh, reputed, uh, Jesus Starfleet that was, uh, supposed to, uh,

1054
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,640
have shown up?

1055
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:07,140
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

1056
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,300
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

1057
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,540
What a space ovation!

1058
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,160
Now let's feel an upper!

1059
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,720
And now in celebration of this great occasion we have planned a lunar party.

1060
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:27,460
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

1061
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:39,880
Bob?

1062
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:50,840
Late that Saturday night before retiring, I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor and studied it until I could close my eyes and see this man's face as though he was standing in front of me.

1063
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,720
It's Bob!

1064
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,440
I love you!

1065
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,820
Bob loves you!

1066
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,100
Bob loves you!

1067
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,100


1068
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,460
Bob loves you!

1069
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,700
And he's flying in success!

1070
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,540
And my friends, professional!

1071
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,780
And Nina loves you!

1072
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,800
I'm gonna see them again and again!

1073
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,620
Is that, is that before or after the Bob pills?

1074
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,480
The arrival of a space ship in Washington.

1075
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:24,220
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false.

1076
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,340
Enjoy!

1077
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,240
Enjoy!

1078
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,740
Enjoy!

1079
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,380
Enjoy!

1080
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,120
Enjoy both!

1081
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,400
Enjoy both!

1082
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,640
Enjoy both!

1083
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,920
Enjoy both!

1084
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,020
Enjoy both!

1085
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,560
Enjoy both!

1086
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,540
Enjoy both!

1087
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1088
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1089
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1090
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1091
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1092
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1093
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1094
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1095
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1096
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1097
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1098
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1099
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1100
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1101
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1102
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1103
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540


1104
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,180
Enjoy the two!

1105
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,320


1106
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:57,500


1107
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,480
I'm coming with advanced knowledge.

1108
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,500
To help human race.

1109
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,940
Do the walking and Bob do the talking.

1110
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,520
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1111
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,120
Where are you leading us, Bob?

1112
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:26,380
What is waiting there for me?

1113
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,040
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

1114
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:43,140
Bob can save me, but will he?

1115
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,520
Don't count on it, Buck.

1116
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,840
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

1117
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,260
Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbs.

1118
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,920
What is waiting there?

1119
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,060
What is waiting there for me?

1120
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,320
Bob.

1121
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,140
Don't count on it, Buck.

1122
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,920
Friend, the elder gods have been sleeping, but they're waking up.

1123
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,780
And you've got to find that word of Bob before...

1124
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,140
Friends, you've got to get on it.

1125
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,720
You've got to get on it.

1126
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,980
And it's on...

1127
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,200
I'm going to give you the address to get on to.

1128
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Friends, you can write to Bob and find out...

1129
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,620
To get free information about the Church of the Subgenius, go ahead.

1130
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,760
Send that self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1131
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,300
That post office box...

1132
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:40,300
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1133
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,720
You know, I've been saying that address for 15 years on the radio.

1134
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,980
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

1135
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,340
But friends, www.subgenius.com is always the thing to do.

1136
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,980
And this in the background is the Flying Ryan Brothers...

1137
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,720
With their...

1138
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,820
Lovely tune, Captain Nemo.

1139
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,380
From their album, Colorama.

1140
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,540
At Ryanetics.com.

1141
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,100
Dear friends, I...

1142
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,500
I'll see you next week.

1143
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,580
I'll see you next week.

1144
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,360
Bye.

1145
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:42,960
Bye.

1146
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:45,660
Bye.

1147
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:45,720
Bye.

1148
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,280
Bye.

1149
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,300
Bye.

1150
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:46,920
Bye.

1151
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,760
Bye.

1152
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,160
Thank you.

1153
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,160
We'll see you all next week.

1154
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,100
... after that game and poking each other's eyes out.

1155
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,180
March 3rd, Friday night, you put taverns.

1156
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,100
The large ones keep coming and keep coming.

1157
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,880
You'll make up your own mind.

1158
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,280
On the map, it says that they're coming down from Canada,

1159
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,600
and much in the same way they went back years and years before.

1160
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,660
The reflux is, as we see up here, quite an invertebrate matter,

1161
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,080
and as we're all shrinking back to the invertebrate form,

1162
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,920
we're going to enjoy these little dips into the cold and back into the warm again.

1163
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,620
Tanya, what's next as far as the evolution?

1164
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,220
... evolutionary parade.

1165
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Goodbye.

1166
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,440
Goodbye.

1167
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,040
...

1168
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:25,800
And friends, that's Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1169
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,100
