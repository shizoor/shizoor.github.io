1
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,000
And then there was the legend of the filthy, crusted underbrews

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,440
whose barren hits of men then used the awesome power to deflower

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,120
Whomsoever said Barrow of Underbrew should choose

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,640
A semi-sentient zebra whose fake old-planet deck was clearly stated that he was a zebra

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
is often found quite earnestly inquiring about it with a last shade from another planet

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
A billion light-years from thy very location in a place called Wondry Virtuous

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,400
the joint trench is hot for active meditation

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
Furious, full of life and stance, more gleeful and to disgust you

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,980
The finer merits of the barren land

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,460
are most recent batch of Saint Seiya episodes

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,640
As an escortian non-Freudians made their way out to the trench again

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
and mocked the French again

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,600
A retrograded, not-so-gumey jellyfish was four inches deep in a small dish

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,300
which just lumped in cafeteria bacteria and selected, collected, and piled high in a petri dish

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,740
Five minutes from now, nowhere near the trench

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,960
A captain creased in a French

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
Professional food with a doubt his mind and a whole lot of truth

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,680
Suddenly set his dog aloes in one third

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,780
and yelling through his teeth in pairs like a freak yelling Ernest

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,680
While the jellyfish man does not seem to get a clue off his pews

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,780
A cross-faced another and completely understated

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:24,980
he is a man

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,460
A savage is the willing able poor

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,840
of an octopod with a cucumber wrapped in duct tape

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,060
While on his oil frisco on sausage

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,360
Tears ruin the perfectly good mascara of a drag queen named Sonia

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,020
whose friends used to call him Fred back in ROTC

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
As a cylindrical midget made him class two

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
who was often seen to stand in sub-tribe steel

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,920
and scream at the top of his little midget lungs

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,840
as the wrong man had done and the disaster's yet to come

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Just that second watching defeated life-religious getting

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,980
Marley-boy speech to a group of teens

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
One of whom is well-to-do

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,420
a certain group of women on the online

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,280
by breaking bushmears

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,340
and a student from the state

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
arriving in the middle of the town on a Sunday

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,240
Around the corner on the dark side of the moon

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,060
in an oblong room

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,900
Jesus played the A-2-Z tune

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,560
and joyfully took a slice of pizza

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
with an amazingly well-to-do white guy named Godai

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,260
and a little girl named

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,960
The El Queso All-Stars

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,860
The El Queso All-Stars, dear friends

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,960
You can find more about the El Queso All-Stars

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,540

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,680
And friends, this is the show

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,400
of the day

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,780
of Drogs

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,860
That's spelled D-R-O-G-G-S

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Drogs

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,260
Because much of it is made from

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,020
Ogvorbis sound files

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,720
or ogs made by Reverend Dr. St. Fernand and Andy Leamer

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,420
the devil

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,440
And he is a doctor

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,200
a doctor of ogs

61
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,920
thus the heavy use of

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Drogs

63
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,180
and dok

64
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:54,400
A Serial Photo.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,400

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,400


67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,400


68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,640
Yes, friends, it's time to let your slack jaws down.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,540
Let the eyes glaze over and stare at your third nostril.

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,460
It's time to give up the goat.

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,120
Give up!

72
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,500
Give up the goat.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,900
And you're feeling soft and lonely and no one cares about you or with you.

74
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,480
Don't you think it's about time you give up the goat?

75
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,660
Come over to the gray side of the force.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,380
Give up.

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,340
Stop your foolish obsession with good and evil.

78
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,300
All are the same.

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,780
Come to the gray side of the force.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, sir.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,720
Well, I smoked a pipe.

82
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,300
We tried smoking coffee, but that was no good.

83
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,180
We tried sein.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:23,920
We tried, definitely, but we did have this.

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:23,940
Yeah.

86
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,400
Oh, so you've

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,960
Government pie.

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,180
Pie and eel and government pie.

89
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,160
Government pie and eel.

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,180
Government cheese.

91
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,620
I got a bunch of government smegma in a box the other day by UPS.

92
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,740
Well, you can't sell that stuff back if it ain't no good.

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,440
There's no guarantee.

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,220
I'm not going to sell it.

95
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm going to hoard it.

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,920
Well, I'm trying to get it back.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,380
It don't work.

98
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,200
For the end times.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
It's the end times.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,960
Have you heard the good news?

101
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,300
It's the end times.

102
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,860
Yeah, well, I ain't about to trust the government in the end times or the beginning times.

103
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,720
Judgment is coming.

104
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,140
You just wake up one morning every day.

105
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm in junior high and I saw some of my classmates all night on the football field.

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,240
That's how it goes.

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,400
So we decided that messing with drugs wasn't always easy.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,020
And yeah, our mom was there.

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,460
We didn't want to let her down.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,360
And our love for drugs that we carried with us off the field.

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,180
Ronnie and I gotten where we are by being involved with drugs.

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,740
There's no two ways about that.

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,280
Drugs.

114
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,120
That's my drug.

It's a robot.

It's heavy.

119
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,600
It can fight it too.

You're bad, trabajar hours are less with your academies.

Why don't you hadn't never tried liquor?

126

I'll obviously be able to help you read this.

Cool stuff.

132
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm odd.

133
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,620
That's what I am.

134
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm really odd.

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,380
Hi, embarrassing people stare at you without a face.

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,140
The face terrified me.

137
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,560
You just want to be normal.

138
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,000
Suck the blackhead.

Bud.

140
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,160
You know what the Lord spoke to me?

141
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,760
He said, son, you're going to see buds.

142
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,440
You're going to see harvest.

143
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,420
Buds.

144
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,140
Harvest.

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,780
Buds.

146
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,260
Harvest.

147
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,860
Buds.

148
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Harvest.

149
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,740
Glory to God.

150
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,420
You won't even know what.

151
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,420
Hit you before everything is over.

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,020
Yeah, the Britons will do something ridiculous.

153
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,120
The Britons broke something in a drunken stupor.

154
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,040
And Britons danced on a colleague's body parts.

155
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,680
And Britons broke their drunken body parts in a stupor.

156
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,740
And the Britons, in a drunken stupor.

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,780
Photocopying some of their drunken colleagues.

158
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,860

Well, Wally's out in the garage taking the nails out of an old fish.

172
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,820
What's he doing a nail for?

173
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,820
Hey Dad, look at these mean nails I pulled out of that old dog in the garage.

174
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,620
Another dog.

175
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,860
Well.

176
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,760
Hey Dad, how come I gotta sleep in the bedroom tonight?

177
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
You still gotta sleep in the bedroom tonight.

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,640
Okay.

179
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,340
But have you heard it was really, might be impossible to pass through the Van Allen Belt without getting really screwed up

180
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,740
and yet at the same time we did it once in 1969 and haven't done it since then?

181
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,060
Have you heard that?

182
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,240
It's one of the conspire theories, things about why.

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Because even though we did it once,

184
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,940
even recently, when we get like 650 miles from the Van Allen Belt,

185
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,140
people's retinas start getting weird and they see things in their heads

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,340
and the radiation is so strong that they turn off the lights on, everything, they can still see and not see.

187
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,780
It's weird.

188
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,960
And so yet...

189
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,900
Hey, there was a virtual particle.

190
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Did you see that?

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,460
It was right about here.

192
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,560
It's a wave particle.

193
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,340
A virtual particle came into existence and disappeared.

194
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,840
Was it a rod or a particle?

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
In an instant.

196
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,460
I saw it right here.

197
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,980
Right in the nanosecond.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
He thinks he's seeing a nanotime.

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,180
Maybe he saw a rod head on so it appeared to him as a particle but it was really a rod.

200
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,080
What if you saw like a nano-virus...

201
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,660
Straight on, yes.

202
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,860
...about to infect your whole entire...

203
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh, not Lionel, not your actual being.

204
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,980
I guess it's probably the dog house.

205
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,880
What would happen if all of a sudden...

206
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,380
Suddenly.

207
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,680
...all of the virtual particles that come into existence and disappear and whatever, you know...

208
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,220
What if they all stayed?

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,540
Just like hung out the whole time?

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Immediately.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,180
Immediately.

212
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,660
Our whole reality just sort of turned into a big goop of...

213
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,040
It would bend.

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
It would fill up real fast.

215
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,800
It would bend.

216
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,700
It would start bending.

217
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,580
We'd see things, you know...

218
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,960
It would lock up.

219
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,500
It would be like a typical part of your tranquility base.

220
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,060
The guests come, refuse to leave, drink all the liquor.

221
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,820
And then the molecules lock up and it...

222
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,220
And then they're ruined at the bartender.

223
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Got to get thrown out by a codeine.

224
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,460
Some of them do start elongating just like, you know, an actual molecular biotics.

225
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,880
They start getting fatter on the bottom, longer on top.

226
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
Some of them turn different colors, spectral...

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,840
I've been doing that, my stuff lately.

228
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:18,980
I've been doing that, my stuff lately.

229
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:18,980


230
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,200
I've been doing that, my stuff lately.

231
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm trying to sit around and stare at Chad while he's trying to make time with some hot

232
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:22,920
chick.

233
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,080
You know, usual stuff.

234
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,440
Well, sometimes they're quite hot in a solar sense and actually burn up the young

235
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,600
man's fingers in an umlaut.

236
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,920
He's dealt with some real...

237
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,020
Chasing strange out of my bed.

238
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,180
Pyro nymphets.

239
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
You invited me.

240
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,080
It's the cayenne lotion.

241
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,620
Yeah.

242
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,320
The cayenne lotion.

243
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,680
I thought they bled lighter fluid or something.

244
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,500
No, no, no.

245
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,080
No, no.

246
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
No, no, no.

247
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:48,960
No, no, no.

248
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,960


249
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,960


250
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,960


251
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,960


252
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,960


253
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,200
No, no, no.

254
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,200


255
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,560
No, I'll be all right.

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,440
Hello?

257
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,140
Bob?

258
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,900
No.

259
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes?

260
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,460
No!

261
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Hello?

262
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,140
Who is it?

263
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,620
Bob?

264
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,100
Yes.

265
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
No.

266
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,000
Ah!

267
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,960
No!

268
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,360
Bob?

269
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,340
No.

270
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,120
No!

271
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,480
Bob?

272
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,600
No!

273
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,620


274
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,620


275
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,620


276
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,960
Bob?

277
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


278
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


280
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


281
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


282
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,960


283
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,780
Bob?

284
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,720
No.

285
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,980
Hello? Hello? Hello?

286
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,000
Goodbye.

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
Alright, boys.

288
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,720
Belly up to the table. Get yourself some hair there.

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,420
And here, paint on some eyebrows.

290
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,280
You look like a bunch of freaks.

291
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,020
Hey, you promised me a mustache.

292
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,340
Hey, Toad promised me I could be a blonde.

293
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,980
I want to be a redhead.

294
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,980
I like red.

295
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,980
Come on, Bob.

296
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:30,660
I love it.

297
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
When you're feeling sad and tired of being blue,

298
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,220
get yourself a new broom.

299
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,600
And this is what you do.

300
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,520
Start a sweep in the clouds, causing all the gloom.

301
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,120
Sweep away your troubles with a new broom.

302
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
So sweep, sweep.

303
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,440
Keep a sweeping jack. There's a blue sky.

304
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
Leave the clouds of black.

305
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,660
So sweep.

306
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,540
Sweep, sweep.

307
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,420
Sweep away the gloom to the boogie rhythm of the new broom.

308
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,440
When the clouds hang high

309
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,220
and you're feeling old, make yourself a clean sweep.

310
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,140
Though they're going slow if you keep right on.

311
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Boy, you're gonna find pretty soon you're bound to hit the sunshine.

312
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580
So sweep, sweep.

313
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,120
Keep a sweeping jack.

314
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,420
There's a blue sky.

315
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,940
Leave the clouds of black.

316
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,220
So sweep, sweep.

317
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,360
Sweep away the gloom to the boogie rhythm of the new broom.

318
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
So sweep, sweep.

319
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,780
Keep a sweeping jack till the sun shines.

320
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,160
Comes a shining back.

321
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,400
So sweep, sweep.

322
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,260
Sweep away the gloom.

323
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,740
To the boogie rhythm of the new broom.

324
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:49,740


325
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:00,560
Sweep away the gloom to the boogie rhythm of the new broom.

326
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,160
Can you still hear me?

327
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,240
I don't know if you...

328
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,820
Are you calling me?

329
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,680
Who are you?

330
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,680
No, I can't.

331
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,220
No, okay.

332
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,380
Get off this line.

333
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,240
This is a very personally important place.

334
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,800
This is the Universal Church of the Subject King.

335
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,900
And, uh, this is, uh, Jenny's...

336
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,320
Jenny's...

337
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,660
Jenny's...

338
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, no, what?

339
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Oh, yeah, man, she was pretty all right,

340
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,840
but, you know, she said there was something wrong

341
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,020
with her pineal gland.

342
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
You know, she could make, like,

343
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,020
her flavors in the air and stuff.

344
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,340
You know, she would make weird smells like, um,

345
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,060
gossamer duck, the French fried potato syndrome.

346
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,560
She lived there, man.

347
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,560
She lived there five and a half weeks.

348
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,420
What the Multifarians preach and believe is based on the concept of strength through disfigurement.

349
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,980
Beer in itself is an integral yet not exclusive element in the Multifarian way of life.

350
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,020
Most American beer drinkers are fat, lazy snuttle-arbs who have little desire or knowledge

351
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,920
on the true powers of the brew in which they partake.

352
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,060
Most people drink to escape problems and reality.

353
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,920
Multifarians, conversely, drink to create problems for those normals around them

354
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,920
so they can indulge in the holy hour of party-hawty

355
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,360
and be the true social buffoons they were in fact born to be.

356
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,640
That is why the darkest day on the Multifarian calendar is the dreaded Amateur Night,

357
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,560
known to pink boys as New Year's Eve,

358
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,000
when every normal feels obliged to get pie-faced even though they don't understand the power

359
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
and therefore ruin the good times of we stooges who take the job every day.

360
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,620
Okay.

361
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,160
All these idiots do is crowd the bars, talk loud and stupid, smash up the road, smell awful,

362
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
and give alcohol a bad name.

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,520
Fortunately, these gnats will kill off themselves and each other due to the fact

364
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,360
that they do not understand the power.

365
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,280
The Multifarian not only understands the power but knows how to use it and abuse it to his or her advantage.

366
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,080
One power is the holy sanity flush.

367
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,200
A great power of the Malt is to make every member a space shot for NASA, a true astronaut.

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,600
Every morning, I have to go to the Maltese.

369
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:12,600


370
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,720
After a disfigurement bout, the Multifarian enters the Tabernacle of Extra-Meditation

371
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,920
prepared to blast off, to shoot the moon, so to speak.

372
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,500
This great cleansing process clears the head as well as the intestines.

373
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,460
Its effectiveness is doubled if it's performed after a wake-up call game of hide the salami.

374
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,120
The Multifarian will then have gotten rid of all the substances that reside in the Gouda Chakra region

375
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,980
and will head off to the bar feeling like a new stoge.

376
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,520
A new lightness and quickness of step will send the Multifarian on his way

377
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
to face another challenge.

378
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,440
another day. Another important element in the way is the act of getting reflected while

379
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,660
having a bout with the plague of pain, i.e. the mirror of disfigurement, by taking in

380
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,740
the sacrament of what it looked like. The brainoma, in which the contents of the brain

381
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,100
are hosed out at breakneck speed, thereby removing all unwanted particles and boosting

382
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,700
the buildup of the loose parts into a more cohesive force. If the beer takes care of

383
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,600
the lower torso, so the what it looked like takes care of the upper. The cleaner something

384
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,920
is, the better it works, but it cannot be so clean as to remain totally purified. This

385
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,960
brings us to the diet of the multifarion. Essentially, the worse something is supposed

386
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,860
to be for you, the better in fact it is. You are told by the medical and governmental lackeys

387
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,180
all about what you should do and what you shouldn't do to have a better life. It's all

388
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,100
bullshit. They tell you all that stuff to keep you weak. They know of the power, the

389
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,360
power of the malt, but they lie about it to you.

390
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,180
They tell you how to live right, and how to eat right, and how to exercise right, and

391
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,620
how to fuck right, and how to shit right, and how to fart right, and every fucking thing

392
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,580
else, but they're all wrong. They're just trying to keep you in your self-improved place,

393
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,320
so they can retain psychological powers over you. If they told you how radioactive you

394
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,580
really are, they wouldn't be able to scare you with horror stories of Russians, and bombs,

395
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,000
and all that other horseshit. If they told you that after the bomb falls you'll feel

396
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,180
the same way you do now, they'd just be a little less of you, then you wouldn't be so

397
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,340
concerned with trying to play with the world.

398
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,740
They're the idiotic gays with their enemies because no one would give a fuck. The only

399
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,880
reason we have politicians and militaristic and all the guys that can't fuck can have

400
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,960
a job so that they can get a hard-on in their heads because the only time they use their

401
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,900
worthless shriveled pegasus to take a leak and a toxic yellow one at that, not the true

402
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,380
holy silver spray of the Malta Farai. The only way to live, therefore, is to partake

403
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,340
in as many poisons available, thereby building up a superhuman immunity system.

404
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,780
Just because the rest of humanity has worked to stop evolution doesn't mean you have

405
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,260
to. Remember the insects in the DDT? Made them pretty fucking strong, didn't it? Ha ha

406
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,280
ha. How about them cockroaches? Who the fuck do you think is gonna take over the torch

407
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,100
from man after we've gone the way of the dinosaurs? Eat junk food. Eat and drink tons of chemical

408
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,180
preservatives. Put hot sauce on everything and anything. The hotter the better. Burn

409
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,400
a hole in your digestive tract. Listen to everything so loud it makes your ears ooze.

410
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,340
You'll never need a Q-tip again. You'll never need a Q-tip again. You'll never need a Q-tip

411
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,340


412
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,040
again. Your ears will be so clean you'll be able to hear somebody fart from across

413
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,020
the street. Eat raw meat. Don't forget sushi and hot sauce. Build the tolerance. You will

414
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,760
survive. By partaking in the yin-yang of poison, enter poison, exit, you will build a strength

415
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,620
unknown to others, keeping clean while remaining poisoned. And when it comes to exercising,

416
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,620
don't bother with jogging. Don't bother with nihilists. Don't bother with any of that other

417
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,720
corporate nonsense. Just fuck that it. Fuck. I want you to fuck. Fuck as if your life depended

418
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,340
on it because fuck.

419
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,580
God damn it. Fucking does. The way of the Maltefari shall not be forsaken.

420
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:54,480
Oh yes, yes, yes, friends. The great and legendary brother Cleve Duncan with the Maltefarian Manifesto

421
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:03,920
from the 1983 subgenius collection of subgeniuses called Bad Doctors made by physicians who took

422
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,360
it upon themselves to heal themselves.

423
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,340
Subgenius.

424
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,340


425
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,740
Loser.

426
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:18,860
Phew. I wanted to be an artist.

427
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,000
A thing like that can be dangerous.

428
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,360
Now I've got a lot of friends.

429
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,960
Oh. What'll I do?

430
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,500
Here we go again!

431
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,980
I wanted to be an artist.

432
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm not kidding!

433
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,640
Do you want to eat something?

434
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,480
Just one. I already ate.

435
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,460
Okay, then I'll have the schnitzel.

436
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,880
No, I already ate, but I will have... what was the first one?

437
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,460
The schnitzel?

438
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes.

439
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,360
Okay.

440
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,440
Do you have the raspberry?

441
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,780
Where is the strawberry?

442
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,500
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry...

443
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,340
Aaaaaah!

444
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,580
Stop smearing egg cells in your underwear.

445
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,680
We don't have to swear to you.

446
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,560
You said it like it's a bad thing.

447
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,860
You awoke from the tombs, didn't you?

448
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,980
We pulled you out.

449
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,120
You look like you aren't breathing.

450
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,880
For five minutes we smack you firmly with that dendrite about your face and heads.

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,960
Now look at you, all fully grown up.

452
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,340
Do you think it'd be safe if we just go in there?

453
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,300
I set up a little pup tent.

454
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,320
Oh, yes.

455
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,680
But you've got to find the little pup first.

456
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,580
If we went to Ayers Rock in Australia, would we be safe?

457
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
You know, just set up a little pup tent there with the aboriginals and the kangaroos.

458
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,360
Yes, if you rub your spine against the rock, it is a great geomantic pleasure to your lower extremities.

459
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,700
You get your little jibbery-doo there.

460
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,140
You're placing it back here.

461
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,740
Somebody say something about geometric pleasures.

462
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,680
Yes, geometric pleasures, what you can enjoy.

463
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,500
I thought you said geomentric pleasures.

464
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,860
Ah, geomonastic.

465
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,420
The pleasures of the mind-meld sex.

466
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Yes, you thought I meant geomonastic pleasures.

467
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,520
No, I do not know those monkeys.

468
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,600
I was thinking of sex with whales myself.

469
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Disconnected.

470
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,400
The whales will all be gone soon thanks to U.S. naval sonar devices.

471
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,860
No, that is not true.

472
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,700
That is not true.

473
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,140
Dog dogs will help repopulate the population of whales.

474
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,960
To the...

475
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:40,880
What?

476
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,960
Sanyo.

477
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,180
...shall grow like the old seaweed bags at the grog shop.

478
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,520
Can you still hear him?

479
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,680
...sunshine pinky wankies.

480
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,300
Can you still hear him?

481
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,860
He took some sort of pill.

482
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,860
No, not here.

483
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
The

484
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:18,240
When I was 14 I had two different thoughts but...

485
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,880
But what is it?

486
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,860
How about that?

487
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,280
Oh, my God.

488
00:24:53,860 --> 00:25:04,720
Oh, my God.

489
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:53,840
Oh, my God.

490
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:22,180
Oh, my God.

491
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:52,340
Oh, my God.

492
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:04,340
Oh, my God.

493
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:44,080
Oh, my God.

494
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,180
Oh, my God.

495
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,200
I'd like to kill my food.

496
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,580
I'm going to shoot a loaf of bread with it.

497
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,720
There's no food here, so please put it away,

498
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,720
and we'll discuss this rationally.

499
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,920
I'd like to make sure my bread's well dead when I shoot it.

500
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,600
You mean you even shoot harmless vegetables?

501
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,920
Ah, there's nothing harmless about a vegetable.

502
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,460
You ever had one of them attack you in the middle of the night

503
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,940
like an artichoke grabs you by the throat?

504
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,280
Them scratchy little devils.

505
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm Daddy Duke Weird,

506
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,760
and it's Blaney.

507
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,860
You see, no one in my profession does a job like me.

508
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,840
This is the work of Darth Vader.

509
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,400
I used to be a taxidermist.

510
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,080
I am still.

511
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,060
I would stuff all of the animals the hunters would kill.

512
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,300
But I couldn't keep looking at their big brown eyes,

513
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,460
and my life became a torture that I grew to despise

514
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,780
because I couldn't work on something that made animals dead,

515
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
so I got a great idea.

516
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
I'd stuff vegetables instead.

517
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Now, I don't stuff mooses,

518
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,900
wolverines, or mongooses,

519
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,420
or any of that stuff.

520
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,080
I'm a vegetable stuffer.

521
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,280
Let me tell you, nothing's tougher than that.

522
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,500
I stuff cabbage and potatoes.

523
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,060
Okay, punch the big cellar button.

524
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,720
Cabbage and potatoes.

525
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,400
You know what happened?

526
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,580
Asparagus and cabbage.

527
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,000
And some big calla flowers that can really be savage.

528
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,560
So then what happened?

529
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm a vegetable stuffer.

530
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Wham, wham.

531
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,520
Let me tell you nothing's tougher than that.

532
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:17,920
I am.

533
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,820
So then what happened?

534
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,040
Some KPFA.

535
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,400
Some KPFA.

536
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,140
A subgenius show with Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Howell

537
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,280
and in puzzling evidence,

538
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,600
amazing...

539
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:31,680
...

540
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:40,940
Hey, did you guys hear about some local news of vandalism of a church?

541
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,680
Of a subgenius?

542
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,120
Well, no, no.

543
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,240
There was like a Christmas display outside of a church

544
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,980
here in Northern Ohio

545
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,940
from which a little baby Jesus was stolen

546
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,820
from the display.

547
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,600
And where is he now?

548
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,060
Where is little baby Jesus now?

549
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,280
Not in your house, I hope.

550
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,860
Well, little baby Jesus showed up at another church on the front porch,

551
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,420
satanized by some youths who've been...

552
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,720
rather, one youth who's been arrested.

553
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,940
Are you sure they are youths?

554
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,200
Now, the newspaper report I read said that...

555
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,700
Mr. Sister pointed us to this.

556
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,920
There were satanic symbols of some kind etched on the doll's forehead.

557
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,580
The baby Jesus.

558
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,840
Did they attempt to decipher them?

559
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,820
And it said there was a pipe in its chest.

560
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,020
Uh-oh.

561
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,460
And it didn't say if it was a plumber's pipe or, you know, a Dr. Grabow's...

562
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,060
Well, you just said right there, Dr. Grabow's, you know,

563
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,660
could it have been, you know, an act of lunacy?

564
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,680
Or could it have been an act of alleged piracy by those saying...

565
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,200
Some things you don't have to spell out.

566
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,640
Yeah.

567
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,320
A pipe in its chest.

568
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,900
And it's supposed to be in its mouth or in its mouth?

569
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,440
Or it's derriere.

570
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,580
We are investigating these.

571
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,860
I'm surprised you didn't say there was an arrow stuck through his forehead, too.

572
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,660
Well, what you gotta do is get a good public relations firm.

573
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:09,120
Hey, I know how those people feel having religious icons and expensive props stolen and defaced.

574
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,580
Imagine the things that they've done to that Bob dummy.

575
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,340
Hell, yeah.

576
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,720
The sodomization.

577
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,560
Sodomization.

578
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,980
That's the least of it.

579
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,560
It's full of sawdust.

580
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:22,620
The thing is, it's semen-stained and yellowed, and yet it continues to...

581
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,120
And the worst thing is they keep bringing it back.

582
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,920
It continues to excite.

583
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,360
Sooner or later, it always comes back.

584
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,860
A little bit smellier, a little bit more stained.

585
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,680
Pop that.

586
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,100
Bob, get that Bob out of here.

587
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
Get that horrible smelly...

588
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,500
Look at that Bob.

589
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,500
He's just smoking.

590
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
Oh, he's gross.

591
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,820
Oh, oh.

592
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,560
And look, there's some sort of vomitus.

593
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,980
Oh, wait.

594
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,560
And the trail.

595
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,360
Yeah, we could probably sell that stuff.

596
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,100
That trail looks like the kind of stuff a slug leaves behind when it walks around, you know, crawls around.

597
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,920
Well, but what if we scrape that up?

598
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,820
Do you think you could, like, smoke that trail he...

599
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
What was that episode?

600
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,660
I ain't smoking it.

601
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,360
That's a good smoke.

602
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,160
By the way, you can call in about the girl, girl, girl, PN510 area code.

603
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,200
And you can talk...

604
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,980
And speak with good coffee.

605
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,820
You can talk to the doctors, the doctors and the merchants of...

606
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,980
And that is international, folks.

607
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,400
You can call from France or Israel or Finland or Guam.

608
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,960
And you can say exactly that.

609
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,080
Can you say what the open...

610
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,480
What the open man said?

611
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,280
Can you say...

612
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,240
I can't say it.

613
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,520
Once upon a time...

614
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,840
Spawns.

615
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,600
The boy sincerely described about the night in the hut with white woman.

616
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,300
He also praised about the beauty of that wonderful woman.

617
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,420
She was like you, an angle.

618
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,720
She was not a human being.

619
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,300
Where are you?

620
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,180
It was very afraid of her.

621
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,540
I cannot say whether it was dreams or real scene.

622
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,700
She was white woman.

623
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,680
She was a woman of the snow.

624
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:01,540
Hearing this, all of a sudden, Oyuki got up and came to stand before his face crying.

625
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,540
It was I, Yuki.

626
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,560
But I told you that I do not repeat this story.

627
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,840
You must have remembered that whenever you tell about this to anyone, I will kill you.

628
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,740
But for the sake of the children, I will not kill you now.

629
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,300
Take care of our children.

630
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,680
Of all our children.

631
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,760
If someone will complain about your bad treatment, I will not leave you.

632
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,920
And I cannot do whatever I like.

633
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,940
Some people get a kick out of being poked and prodded at the hospital.

634
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,580
It's an expensive habit.

635
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,820
It makes them feel important when people are touching them and poking them and sticking instruments in them.

636
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,960
Expensive instruments.

637
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,480
The more expensive, the more important.

638
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,400
Some people don't even get sick when they go to the hospital.

639
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,480
They just want to go there to experience psychedelic drugs.

640
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,740
But that's their sickness, you see, Dr. Drummond.

641
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,860
The hypochondriac is sick.

642
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,940
Even though his specific illnesses are made up.

643
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,920
How do you cure that sickness except with more and more drugs?

644
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,800
Well, that's what I do.

645
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,520
Now, when I go to the hospital, I like to think about the meals they have there.

646
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,120
Because they're so great.

647
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,060
Sometimes I just fake a sickness just so I can go in there and have those great things.

648
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,580
Have you ever been to a French hospital?

649
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,200
They have really good hospital food.

650
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,440
Oh, man. In a French hospital, that's where you get that French hospital food.

651
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,100
Or a French airliner. Have you ever been on a French airliner?

652
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,500
Oh, man. Now you're talking.

653
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,560
Oh, and all the other countries' airliners you can drink for free and smoke cigarettes.

654
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,560
And free blowjobs on other countries' airlines.

655
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,040
Like Canadian Airlines, you get free oral sex from a flight attendant.

656
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,940
As well as the co-pilot.

657
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,120
A sponge bath.

658
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,180
A sponge bath on Japan Air.

659
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,420
On Lufthansa, you get massages and free cocaine.

660
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,400
But in America...

661
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,340
American Airlines, you get a full-body cavity search.

662
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,780
And a rice bowl.

663
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,520
I've thought about nurses ever since I was a young man.

664
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,000
I've never stopped thinking about nurses.

665
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Have you hurt as a child? Did you go be in the hospital for a while?

666
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,860
I've always been hurt. I've always been hurt as a child, as a young man, as an adult.

667
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,060
I've never stopped hurting.

668
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,340
Philo is a victim.

669
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,880
He's a victim of this victim society.

670
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,720
I'm a victim of the society of the victims are walking through.

671
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,940
The tendency to victimize everyone.

672
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,740
He has good health care.

673
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,020
But, you know, it's your own fault.

674
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,540
It's true, you are a victim.

675
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,900
He was spoiled by that good health care.

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
And in that respect, he's a victim.

677
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,060
I know.

678
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,360
I'm a victim of the society that made me a taking human being.

679
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,300
A beast of burden to the man himself.

680
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,380
Wasn't he in that DHA project?

681
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,280
We're not what you'd call human.

682
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,920
Over the past 200 years, the kinds of conscience that's walked layer by layer in the crucible...

683
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:19,920


684
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,460
You can find out the secrets of that.

685
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,300
Michael's got these T-shirts on.

686
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,040
He made it himself.

687
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,280
We are the only ones.

688
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,740
Did they not say the White House was our primordial suit?

689
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,940
A base for evolution?

690
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,000
Sure.

691
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,420
We put not the evil in the evolution, friend.

692
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,660
You know, I went to the open office.

693
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:49,900
And I was like, what the hell is this?

694
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,780
And they were out of pancreas.

695
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,600
And they were out of sweetbread.

696
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,580
Don't you know that our plans never work?

697
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,820
Don't worry.

698
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,580
In one head and out the other.

699
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,680
Sound, sound, sensation, flavor, odor, our words sound.

700
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,400
In consequence of this, at a very early age, Clayton began to reject his environment.

701
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,180
And vice versa.

702
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,660
He began to formulate unconsciously the principles of avoidism.

703
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,080
You will hear overwhelming masses of sound.

704
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,900
Yeah, and what's avoidism?

705
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,940
It's a form of self-discipline.

706
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,660
Clayton began to avoid making good grades in school.

707
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,480
That was easy.

708
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,540
He simply avoided going to school at all.

709
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,840
His family tried to interest him in studies.

710
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,840
And at one time, they hired a tutor.

711
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,380
And Clayton started to learn how to write.

712
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,280
However, it took the tutor eight months to teach him how to make a period.

713
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,820
And he finally gave up and discussed it.

714
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,920
It extends not only from wall to wall, but from ceiling to floor.

715
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,880
After this one non-avoidism, he decided to go to college.

716
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,100
He began to avoid the so-called avoidistic retrogression.

717
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,220
Clayton never again looked forward.

718
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:59,780
He began to avoid people with mustaches, people without mustaches, spinach, Hoot Gibson movies, and so he.

719
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,760
He began to sleep on the ugly rest mattress.

720
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,740
A mattress he designed himself for people who don't care how they look.

721
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
They just want a place to lie down.

722
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,260
By the time he was 18 years old, Clayton had developed a primitive avoidist position.

723
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,680
Still used by some of the older generation.

724
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:35,240
But if he didn't leave college, he was pretty famous.

725
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,880
He made a million たhal for the most ottill the one who wanted it.

726
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:37,880


727
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,080
The very early Cambrian

728
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,300
The amount of snowfilters?

729
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,840
He helped ky Nä idea.

730
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,180
He cров obviously.

731
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,440
It makes me whole.

732
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,080
Did you do a lot of acid in the 60s?

733
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,860
Yeah, did you do a lot?

734
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
Man, like tonight.

735
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,040
What's the 60s?

736
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,100
David, did you drop acid before you came up here?

737
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,700
No, man, I dropped acid in the 523s.

738
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,140
Man.

739
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,220
That's a double six.

740
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,540
I mean, that's a double five.

741
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,020
I dropped acid in the 523s, man.

742
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,340
And it's still wearing off to this day.

743
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,760
Did the Egyptians have acid?

744
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,020
Of course they did.

745
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,960
Lotus seed.

746
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,800
That's not acid.

747
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,420
Well, it's kind of acid.

748
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
No, I'm talking blotter, man.

749
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,940
Oh, well, geez.

750
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,020
You have to go back beyond the pyramid days to get real blotter.

751
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,460
You know, like Mr. Natural or Sunshine or something.

752
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,580
Well, actually, the rotted rye bread will produce that.

753
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,560
The same ergot.

754
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,140
Yes, a molecule that will make you sick as a dog.

755
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,580
But you'll see the devil and God while you're puking.

756
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,800
And you'll have a sandwich with both of them.

757
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,860
Some rotten pumpernickel.

758
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,000
It's like bad acid.

759
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,520
There were whole villages in the Middle Ages that would suffer from ergot poisoning.

760
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,320
Oh, so another thing in the news today.

761
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,560
That's where the Church of the Subgenius first came from.

762
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,060
Science in the news.

763
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,920
Teotihuacan.

764
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,880
Now there's new evidence.

765
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,620
They're unearthing right now.

766
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,620
They're finding all kinds of sacrificial skulls.

767
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:30,200
And everybody thought the Teotihuacans were that peaceful, stargazing bunch of folks down there.

768
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
Well, they were skull lovers, though.

769
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,440
Skull farmers!

770
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,860
They didn't kill those people.

771
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,500
Those were people who had died before.

772
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,000
And whose skulls were gently and literally in their remains.

773
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,300
No, because then it lines up with a new...

774
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,140
And some building down in the...

775
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,240
The...

776
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,360
Peninsula.

777
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,320
The Yucatan Peninsula.

778
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,300
There's something...

779
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,580
They...

780
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:50,880
They...

781
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,680
What do you call it when you figure it out?

782
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,700
You deciphered...

783
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,320
Deciphered.

784
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,500
Some of the glyphs.

785
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,540
And it read something about...

786
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,160
Get the fuck away from me.

787
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,220
Some sort of, like, astronomers from the north.

788
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,560
You know, and...

789
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,220
Astronomers from the north?

790
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,140
In a conquest.

791
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,960
Well, that sounds like the people of the Red Dog.

792
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,700
Why did the Teotihuacans...

793
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,180
They fell to the people of the Red Dog.

794
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,600
An obvious reference to UFOs.

795
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,920
What else could it possibly be?

796
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,640
I mean, because they are the ones that have the whole city lined up with the stars and everything.

797
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,800
These people's legs are shaped like shrimp.

798
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,660
And these people's legs are shaped like big potatoes.

799
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,420
You know?

800
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,360
You see the genetic differences here?

801
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,500
They must have been stirred by the spoon of an hour.

802
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,780
How come they never talk about that?

803
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,160
There's pyramids here.

804
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,140
All the mysticism all surrounds Egyptian pyramids.

805
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Well, because we...

806
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Hey, there's a pyramid in Kent.

807
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,320
There's a pyramid in Kent.

808
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,340
There is.

809
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:43,900
There's a mound.

810
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,300
There's a pyramid-shaped mound in Kent.

811
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,380
Oh, there's a pyramid right...

812
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,100
Right in front of the music building over here.

813
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,280
Well, if you ever see them when they're real big, you'd say they're pyramids.

814
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,840
They're not like teats.

815
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,560
But the ones in Mexico are as big as the ones in Egypt.

816
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,000
And you never hear about it.

817
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,440
Oh, you'll hear more about them because...

818
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,540
The mystics don't talk about it.

819
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,920
It's all Egyptology.

820
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,580
Egyptology.

821
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,320
Egyptology.

822
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,680
You were just talking about it.

823
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,900
The skull farmers there.

824
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,820
Yeah, but it's not popular.

825
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,220
The Newagers.

826
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,060
Oh, you can get in trouble for saying stuff like that.

827
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,700
How come the Newagers haven't picked up on it?

828
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,800
Well, they'll pick your shoes.

829
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,200
Why hasn't it become the Mecca?

830
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,180
Of the New World.

831
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,820
Well, they don't like the skulls.

832
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,460
Well, we need a big stone to walk around.

833
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,580
Decapitations in the heart.

834
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,140
You know, the live beating hearts.

835
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,180
It should be the Mecca of the New World.

836
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,560
Try decapitating a live beating heart.

837
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:36,040
Millions of frat boys and midriff girls should be driving down to Teotihuacan and having a big hootenanny.

838
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,100
Right there in the street of the dead.

839
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,560
Have you heard of the Kirsch?

840
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,040
I think that those boys and girls should be sacrificed on the altar of the sun.

841
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,600
Because of the cocaine.

842
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah.

843
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,520
Yeah, there you go.

844
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,280
I will help.

845
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,620
And have their hearts decapitated.

846
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,100
Yes.

847
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,940
Decapitate their hearts.

848
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,680
Decapitate their hearts.

849
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,680


850
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,180
Those, yes, those vapid, watery-eyed youths of America.

851
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,060
Spoiled.

852
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,320
Those glamorous, suffering, poopoo, panting, old suburban yaks.

853
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,280
Because wealthy, healthy, sane people.

854
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,260
I hate them.

855
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,600
Have you guys heard of the Kirsch of the cocaine mummies?

856
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,340
Now, this is true.

857
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,640
They did a drug test on mummies in Egypt and guess what they found in them?

858
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,980
Not only did they find them.

859
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,800
They found wine, hempish, which of course they smoked in Egypt quite a lot.

860
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,500
And lotus seed mixed with wine, which they like to take a lot and make them feel goofy and stuff.

861
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,080
They found cocaine and tobacco.

862
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,760
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

863
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,520
Wait, tobacco?

864
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,840
Cocaine and tobacco.

865
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,840
Wait a minute.

866
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

867
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,400
That's the idea.

868
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,180
The wait, wait, wait.

869
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,020
In Egypt.

870
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,480
I was with you all the way until you said tobacco.

871
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,740
That is the weird part of it.

872
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,140
Oh, it was something else.

873
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,740
I'm sure it wasn't American tobacco.

874
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Well, they think.

875
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,900
They keep on twisting it.

876
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:45,960
They keep on twisting it.

877
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:52,260
They keep on twisting the titty further and further and tweaking it further and it's coming up more and more American tobacco and good old Peruvian cocaine.

878
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:00,200
And so what they assumed was, you know, they just across China there was a trade route because, you know, China goes back 5,000 and so does Egypt.

879
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,940
So they were hanging around back in the day.

880
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,500
And we weren't.

881
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,500
Because we were just picking our noses in caves in Europe.

882
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,280
5,000 years ago?

883
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,740
No, man.

884
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,420
It was like Conan.

885
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,160
You know, there was giant snakes and castles and cyclopses and stuff.

886
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,300
Yeah, Conan.

887
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:15,980
Yeah.

888
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,300
Heavy broadswords.

889
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,980
There were still saber tooth tigers.

890
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,040
Hairy kilts and broadswords.

891
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,400
Saber tooth tigers.

892
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,280
Oh, yeah, man.

893
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:23,880
Yeah.

894
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:23,960
Yeah.

895
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:23,960


896
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:23,960


897
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,940
The woolly mammoth was still walking around.

898
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,160
Dragons, you know.

899
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,900
And knights.

900
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,820
I don't know about.

901
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,940
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,300
You're right.

903
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:30,600
You're right.

904
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,780
Come on.

905
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,860
Don't you know history, man?

906
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,720
What kind of an ignoramus are you?

907
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,600
Didn't you go to American high school?

908
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:35,600


909
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,760
I studied the Knights of the Round Table.

910
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,520
That's true.

911
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,520
I am a Hippocratic Oath and I'm also a bad steed tiger.

912
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,360
I know someone who knew King Arthur.

913
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,280
And your horse.

914
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,380
I know a horse.

915
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,840
And your hippocampus is all messed up too.

916
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,200
It was before witches were extinct.

917
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,100
Yes, it seems it's in record.

918
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,100


919
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,100


920
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,100


921
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,140
Bigger

922
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,460
Bigger

923
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,540
Bigger

924
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,800
Thank you.

925
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,660
Thank you.

926
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Thank you.

927
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,620
Who are you?

928
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,540
Wow, what kind of job do you have?

929
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,560
Where?

930
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:56,940
When?

931
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,520
ABC.

932
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,140
Thank you.

933
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,600
And on ABC tonight,

934
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,640
we're off to see the wizard,

935
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,740
the wonderful wizard, because

936
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,340
we hear he is a whiz of a whiz.

937
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,880
If ever a whiz there was,

938
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,280
every week he comes down the yellow brick road

939
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,720
with a special kind of show.

940
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,340
And when he says,

941
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,260
a wonderful world, we're open for you.

942
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,460
We're dolphins and clippers and dainty glass clippers

943
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,960
and witches that fly over rainbows

944
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,980
and mermaids and gentlemen.

945
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,180
A mermaid, a tin man, and maybe a

946
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,300
thin man, and one of the

947
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,060
villains, a villain, a pony, a gypsy

948
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,580
pony, zebras and clover, we're cowboys,

949
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,400
scarecrows are crying, one car side

950
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,240
lion, a rascal, a vagabond, boys,

951
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,360
boats are floating, and workers are

952
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,200
toting balloons, and airplanes fly,

953
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
and drummers, boys, beatmen, elephants,

954
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,480
they run little fat tugboats to keep on

955
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,580
flying, and where are you?

956
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,500
We're off to see the wizard,

957
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,940
yeah, where?

958
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,020
A wonderful man,

959
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,080
what the hell is this?

960
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,480
It's weird.

961
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,760
And they didn't have their tie on.

962
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,560
Logic is a little tweeting bird

963
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,840
chirping in a meadow.

964
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,900
Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers

965
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,640
that smell bad.

966
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,660
There are no spores on the planet

967
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,720
Klypton, but there are plenty of seeking,

968
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,420
searching eyes looking directly into your

969
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,040
There's no life nowhere!

970
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,780
There's no surf in Cleveland.

971
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,620
I'm falling like a dead man!

972
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,460
Poor little droogie.

973
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,000
Through the canyons of my mind!

974
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,540
There's no more fricapasta, you'll

975
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,400
ruin everything!

976
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,960
And that was it for a little party,

977
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:38,700
and it's freaking now.

978
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,540
The fly's all green and buzzing in this

979
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,920
dungeon of despair.

980
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,920
Well that about says it right there,

981
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,520
a dungeon of despair, I mean we're all

982
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,380
trying to believe it.

983
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,040
I threw up.

984
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,620
Right.

985
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,560
Yeah, well it's obvious, but I can smell

986
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,740
it and see it from here.

987
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,300
Fly's all green and buzzing.

988
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,020
I went ahead and just hobbled myself.

989
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,380
I hamstrung myself so I couldn't run.

990
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,000
You cobbled yourself is what you mean,

991
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,980
you put a new shoe on your old one.

992
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,640
No, no, I hobbled myself, I cut my ankle bone,

993
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,140
my knee.

994
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,000
Your Achilles tendon is weird.

995
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,260
Yeah.

996
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,400
Sometimes you can just bite it out.

997
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,860
The torture never stops.

998
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,940
The torture never stops.

999
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,120
The torture never stops.

1000
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,080
The torture never stops.

1001
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,160
The torture never stops.

1002
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,040
The torture never stops.

1003
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,880
That's right.

1004
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,180
That's right kids.

1005
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,240
Right on through time, down through time

1006
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,740
from the Feudian lords, people who pronounce

1007
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,040
themselves kings simply because they own land,

1008
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,680
amassing small armies that amassed into larger armies,

1009
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,540
and got everybody through the dark ages

1010
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,740
in a whole big party of fun.

1011
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,440
Death blood.

1012
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,720
Hail the Feudian lord.

1013
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,960
Hail the feudal fiefdom.

1014
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,460
Hail the entire process of this-

1015
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,480
And then that just turned into the whole

1016
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,860
kingship and imperialistic sort of thing.

1017
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,860
And then they just turned that into democracy or whatever they call it today or whatever.

1018
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,440
I don't know what it is.

1019
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,800
It's called a bourgeois democracy.

1020
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,700
Come on, everyone knows what it is.

1021
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:23,920
It's still imperialism.

1022
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,960
We can see through it.

1023
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,340
And it just, it never stops.

1024
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:34,220
Whether it's horses and armor and swords or cannonballs or ICBMs.

1025
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,360
It's colonialism, man.

1026
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:36,900
It just keeps going and going.

1027
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,800
It's colonialism, man.

1028
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,100
The torture never stops.

1029
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,880
The torture never stops.

1030
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,940
Yeah, that's right.

1031
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,600
Love.

1032
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,840
The torture never stops.

1033
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:44,840


1034
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:44,840


1035
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,220
The torture just keeps getting harder and harder and harder.

1036
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,220


1037
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,220


1038
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,700
Maybe.

1039
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,200
It's just a kiss away.

1040
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,500
It's just a kiss away.

1041
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,520
The torture never stops.

1042
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,340
Right.

1043
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,840
Murder is a shot away.

1044
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,980
But love is just a kiss away.

1045
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,160
Kiss away, man!

1046
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,380
The torture never stops.

1047
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,960
The torture never stops.

1048
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:57,960


1049
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,280
The torture never stops.

1050
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,100
The torture never stops.

1051
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,940
The torture...

1052
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,620
The torture.

1053
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,800
The torture.

1054
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,920
The torture never stops.

1055

here

1116
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,300
this is George

1117
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,040
Figueroa

1118
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,620
this is George

1119
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,160
Figueroa

1120
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,720
I'm stuck in

1121
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,060
Mexico

1122
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,740
I've been out

1123
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,320
here for about

1124
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:42,860
10 years

1125
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,120
Oh, my God.

1126
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,800
I need to borrow that money real quick, Dave.

1127
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, my God.

1128
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,760
And Johnny Carson called last week.

1129
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,360
George, for God's sake.

1130
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,620
Is this some kind of time warp opened up or something?

1131
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,660
Yeah, actually, it's really weird, man.

1132
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,620
We were all coming out of this fountain here.

1133
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,200
I got Johnny Carson standing right here with me, as a matter of fact.

1134
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,660
You guys, these guys couldn't get back from Mexico.

1135
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,240
They're chewing on the big chunk of hashish.

1136
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,560
They put the Mariposa in the galangal.

1137
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,800
Man, we've been smoking for hours, man.

1138
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,800
Well, you're going to have to wet yourself down pretty soon.

1139
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,960
Now, it sounds like you guys, your voice has cracked since we used to talk all the time.

1140
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,100
Man, I can't even feel my feet much less hear my own voice.

1141
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,700
Well, let me get down here.

1142
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,900
Can you smell your feet?

1143
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,520
I can't explain that.

1144
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,580
These are kids that were listening to us when they were 14, and now they're 30 and living in California.

1145
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,140
And they're stranded in Sinaloa.

1146
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,140
And that's in Sedona.

1147
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,920
I was listening to us when I was like three.

1148
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,560
Is Dave there?

1149
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,520
Yep.

1150
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,860
Dave, this is Johnny Codbuster.

1151
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,700
Hi, John.

1152
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,560
How's your codpiece?

1153
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:37,880
I am.

1154
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,780
My fingers are all over the place.

1155
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,260
They're pruning again, and I'm very worried.

1156
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,640
Well, you know, you're going to have to just remove the whole limb.

1157
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,520
There's something back there.

1158
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,000
It's pretty strange.

1159
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,460
My feet and my toes are hurting very badly.

1160
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,500
Little gerbils and gremlins creeping about the stage tonight.

1161
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,040
You've both had problems with your feet?

1162
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,520
Could you prescribe maybe an ointment or something?

1163
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,320
Oh, sure.

1164
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,680
I would prescribe one, but I wouldn't get too close to it.

1165
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,620
So, Johnny, man, what year did you start calling this here radio show?

1166
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,480
Well, I'll tell you what.

1167
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,620
I remember it was back in 1990.

1168
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,240
Ninety.

1169
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,300
Way back when.

1170
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,700
So, 13 years.

1171
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,000
13 years ago.

1172
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,780
And then we all went and got girlfriends, I think is what happened.

1173
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,200
Yeah.

1174
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,340
Yeah, we got a little something, something on the side.

1175
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,180
But I'm wondering, we're all...

1176
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,420
I remember the syphilitic duck.

1177
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,240
You met them all down at the dumpster, huh?

1178
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,580
Yes.

1179
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:20,860
Thank you, Sam.

1180
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,220
The psycho-syphilitic duck is actually...

1181
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,100
They're all here with me.

1182
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,640
Paperboy is not here, unfortunately.

1183
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,440
Oh, man.

1184
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:25,800
That's all bad.

1185
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,140
But all those kids have gone, and they've gone somewhere special, I think.

1186
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,420
Yeah, very special.

1187
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,180
Dobstown.

1188
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,740
Into the vortex, I think.

1189
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,600
But the three of us ended up over here.

1190
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,800
We're in Mexico somehow.

1191
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,780
Me and...

1192
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,360
Just took them away.

1193
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,640
The psycho-syphilitic duck were just standing here.

1194
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,660
They're looking for a ride.

1195
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,640
Well, they used to call you the blow-up from Sinaloa.

1196
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,800
So how come you're so ill at ease right now?

1197
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,340
Now, did you see the picture of me working with the little children in Dobstown out in

1198
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,000
Malaysia there?

1199
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,500
I don't know if you call it working.

1200
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,060
Did you see that picture?

1201
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:53,980
Working in hours.

1202
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:54,920
Touch your heart.

1203
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,620
Just dang old touch your heart.

1204
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,060
Yeah, you're touching more than their hearts.

1205
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,800
I was working with those kids five minutes long enough to get the picture taken, and

1206
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:00,800


1207
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,720
It was just a photo op.

1208
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,700
Yeah, that's all it was.

1209
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,020
Photo op.

1210
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,420
Yeah, you could...

1211
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,160
I saw a different picture of Dave with some children, but I am not at liberty to discuss

1212
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,960
that at the moment.

1213
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,620
Well, I was just...

1214
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,420
He was teaching them the arts of massage and synchro therapy.

1215
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,340
He was a great diaper man, too.

1216
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:14,740
Yeah.

1217
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,100
Uh-oh.

1218
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,660
That's not what George says over here.

1219
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,340
He says different.

1220
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,840
Well, I just...

1221
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,340
Okay.

1222
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,540
I'm not going to get mad.

1223
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,600
I was going to...

1224
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,080
Dave, Dave.

1225
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,480
These guys are all hot shots.

1226
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,260
I'm going to bless your tuber.

1227
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,680
Local cable access guys in California now.

1228
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,320
Yeah, all three of us are actually the same person.

1229
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,320
We're all in one entity.

1230
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,380
We join forces to become one man.

1231
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,480
Paulo!

1232
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,200
Joe!

1233
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,920
Get the phone!

1234
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,760
Hey.

1235
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,100
Hey.

1236
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,040
Yeah.

1237
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,700
Feeling great.

1238
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,080
My drug.

1239
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,600
A message from the Office for a Free America.

1240
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,300
Render 1 basis of the game today.

1241
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,080
I know about this club and get caughtpaid so that you will watch them.

1242
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,080


1243
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,080


1244
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,080


1245
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,080


1246
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,080


1247
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,160
I love it.

1248
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,460
Thank you.

1249
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,940
Thank you.

1250
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,920
Rockin' Instrumental by Sky Harbor.

1251
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,600
Have you ever wanted to develop your artistic abilities?

1252
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,380
To find out, simply call a better artist.

1253
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,680
My favorite thing is so quick and so convenient, I came home in shock.

1254
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,260
I love the electricity.

1255
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,780
And it was the best ever, ever, just great.

1256
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,720
Fabulous.

1257
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,060
And the cleanup was great.

1258
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,260
I have to buy myself just to give out as gifts.

1259
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,000
I love fatigue and I love my butt.

1260
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,940
I really appreciate the fat dripping.

1261
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,380
Very particular.

1262
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,060
Magnifico.

1263
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,720
Another thing that's really nice, you can have a cocktail all day.

1264
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,860
So dry.

1265
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,980
I like tender.

1266
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,880
It's crisp and tender and cooler.

1267
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,740
Fantástico.

1268
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,440
Call now and order the all-purpose nonstick chicken.

1269
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,340
My husband hates chicken.

1270
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:57,780
Chicken.

1271
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,180
Chicken.

1272
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,480
Chicken.

1273
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:58,800


1274
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,900
Plus, you'll also receive 250 coupons absolutely free.

1275
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,020
And 400 instructional payments of only $19.99.

1276
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,060
Plus, as an agent.

1277
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,560
The proceeding was a program.

1278
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,720
And then there's nothing.

1279
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,040
Thank you.
