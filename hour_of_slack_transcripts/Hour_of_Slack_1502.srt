1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm committed to laying down PR News.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,880
President Bush is wrong.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,760
I disagree.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,400
The president said he's cracked down on dissidents.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,680
The president also said he's violent if they contact PR News.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,200
The U.N. Refugee Agency warns of PR outbreaks in Pennsylvania.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,720
The U.N. says former unsanitary president Bill Clinton is reading PR News in Washington.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Oh, please stop.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,180
This is genius.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,680
Oh, sick.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,560
Mom.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,820
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,660
Ladies and gentlemen, we take pride in presenting a thoughtful address by...

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,160
Adequated.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,840
Badass.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,540
Giant.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,800
Wizards.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,660
And dwarves.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,520
And we're all on a diet.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,540
And we're all on a diet.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,100
They're ignorant.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,880
Fanatics.

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,180
Fools.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,280
A giant, a wizard, or a dwarf.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,280
Hello, boys and girls.

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,380
Overthrow the government and seize all private property.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,680
Now.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,380
Birth of a nation treacherous and filled with obstacles.

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,460
Rebell now.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,820
Now.

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,540
Now is the time.

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,460
The new world begins.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,380
Hello, boys and girls.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
Overthrow the government.

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
Alien force invade.

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
Infest in government.

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,980
Call on the gym.

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,140
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob!

39
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,140
Bob.com.

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,200
B-O-B.com.

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,940
He has now been f-indicted.

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,440
Indicted.

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,940
Indicted.

44
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,440
Indicted.

45
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,460
Bidding bidding bidding bidding.

46
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,880
Indicted.

47
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,400
Blondering.

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,760
Bob.

49
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,620
He faces...

50
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:38,900
Bob.

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,460
Tom delayed.

52
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,000
Hurk.

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,220
Hurt.

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,440
Hurt.

55
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,660
Hurt.

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:40,920
Himself.

57
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,560
Finger.

58
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,960
Pains.

59
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,080
Release irregularity.

60
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,400
Blondering.

61
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:43,740
Bob.

62
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,380
Blondering.

63
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,020
Move on.

64
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,420
Blondering.

65
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,740
Crazy.

66
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,600
Pass pass pass pass.

67
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,400
Move on.

68
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:47,980
Violate.

69
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,480
That's insane.

70
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,020
Time.

71
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,100
Why not let Fidel Castro dream.

72
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
Gone in less than 30 minutes.

73
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,700


74
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,140
That's nutty.

75
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,620
Funneling $10,000.

76
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,900
Why don't you give it to the Nazi corporate donations?

77
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,180
It's ridiculous, Bob.

78
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,040
Mom.

79
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,760
Yep.

80
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Yep.

81
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,400
To help support a child's healthy breast milk.

82
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,000
Mom.

83
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yep.

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,360
Or we end up incorporating this program anomaly, the one you are about to hear if you don't turn away, to make this How Radio Isn't Done Part 10.

85
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,900
That's up to you.

86
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:59,860
Here at UMN's KPFA outlet, UMN's only outlet, you, the listener, will decide, according to your own personal community standards, whether this concept makes any sense.

87
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,980
On the other hand, it has already made a great...

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,100
deal of sense.

89
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,620
C-E-N-T-S.

90
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,420
No show in the history of radio has ever been detected attracting a longer listener attention span than last year's...

91
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,840
Or was it O2?

92
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:31,880
Anyway, the past mergings of Over the Edge and the subgenius Puzzling Evidence Show into five-hour spectacular radio fillers have proven to be, with specific reservations,

93
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,820
among the highest...

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,880
audience ratings traps since Gunsmoke in all of radio history.

95
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:54,420
Therefore, and with special reservations, Over the Edge once again merges with Puzzling Evidence and the whole subgenius directors of the board for this five-hour holiday earthcast of the subgenius Thanksgiving executive banquet.

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,640
Live from the palm palms in the middle regions of the New World Sector Center downtown Berkeley, California.

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,540
With special reservations.

98
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:16,100
We are broadcasting the subgenius executive board's Thanksgiving banquet as a public service designed to enhance your perception of their reality.

99
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,740
Just a moment while I put the CD player on continuous.

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,120
That's better.

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,700
That's better.

102
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,600
That's better.

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,440
That's better.

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,540
That's better.

105
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,620


106
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,160
Speaking of...

107
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,600
We are broadcasting the subgenius executive board's Thanksgiving banquet as a public service designed to enhance your perception of their reality.

108
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,940
And speaking of reality, my role?

109
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,220
That's easy.

110
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,560
That of yours truly, Izzy Isn't, the banquet facilitator.

111
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,760
A psychological deflective diversion which I spent six years training for.

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,620
So that now, as a professional banquet...

113
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:20,840
I am able to ease the way across any direction the twisted tables of such a confoundingly contentious sit-down organization such as the Subgenius Church Foundation of America may take, whenever they gather for this annual Thanksgiving business-like banquet.

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:35,160
And right off the bat, like a left-field vampire, let's go down now to the main banquet pit from my broadcast booth high above them, down to what this five-hour show is really all about.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:45,140
I see Dr. Howe over by the asparagus cooler, professor of esoteria at Estonian U, eating up a storm.

116
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,360
Now Reverend Ivan Stang has risen to his feet from the head table of potheads.

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,540
About to attempt a banquet opening remark.

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:04,020
Let's listen in as one of the disputed founders of the Church of the Subgenius addresses his near-equal fellow executives in the worldwide subgenius semi-organized cult.

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,180
Let's talk a little bit about Ivan.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,340
Again, right smack dab in the center and very, very healthy looking.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,540
Again, you can see very symmetric, good outflow here.

122
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,480
The center of circulation very evident.

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Ivan pummeled Grenada, flattening homes and cutting power.

124
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,920
At least 15 deaths are being blamed on Ivan.

125
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,780
We need you to watch it along with us.

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,940
Right now, Ivan is headed for Jamaica and then Cuba with the latest details.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,920
Hi, Dr. Joe.

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,480
Hi, Abel.

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,700
So Ivan is indeed a monster.

130
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,620
Suddenly, oh well, there's not enough bandwidth.

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
We have a new concern.

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,300
It is a wet mess in Cleveland, Ohio, thanks to Ivan.

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,560
There's the area of uncertainty right there.

134
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Vivian?

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,360
And of course, by then, Carl will be watching Ivan.

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,620
But here's a closer view of Ivan.

137
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
And you can see the red line.

138
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:49,960
Right here.

139
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,280
And you notice it is in the middle of the central dense.

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,200
That's an indication that this is a very, very organized Ivan.

141
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:05,520
And they know that our one world religion is the only antidote for the one world advertiser.

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,920
Ivan, here is Ivan right now.

143
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,180
Down with the quote-less Bob and up with Bob and up with Bob.

144
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,460
We'll be watching Ivan.

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,480
Nowhere here.

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,860
And we'll keep you posted every day on the progress of Ivan.

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,080
Ivan struck the Windward Islands with deadly force yesterday.

148
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,720
Ivan tore off roofs, knocked trees into power lines, and blew down street lights.

149
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,540
At this point in time, is it more likely than not that Ivan will affect the U.S.?

150
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Actually, what time is it?

151
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
Oh, that time.

152
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
It's pledge time.

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,060
Oh, that's Doug Wellman.

154
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,440
It's a tape.

155
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,160
It is a tape.

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,760
But now, consider another fact.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,800
I mean, the mob worked as assassin mechanics.

158
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,640
That's what they're called for the CIA.

159
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,880
Under the CIA's William Harvey, who hated Kennedy.

160
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,380
And while they had a motive, they had, of course, no means to cover up the crime, unlike

161
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,840
Allen Dulles and the CIA and of course, Hoover and his FBI.

162
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,140
And, you know, by the way, George DeMoren Shield once dated Jackie's mother.

163
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,140
He could have been.

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,300
He could have been her stepfather.

165
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,840
And Ruth Payne were both handlers of Oswald with their obvious right.

166
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,740
Well, not so obvious, perhaps, but with right wing intelligence connections.

167
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:37,220
Oswald himself, of course, was an intelligence informant who we had sent to Russia as a double agent.

168
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,460
You know, after we trained him in the Russian language, which came out in the Warren Commission hearings.

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,300
Yes, let me tell you something, man.

170
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,840
The CIA tried to kill me like must have been 11 minutes ago.

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,400
You know what I'm saying?

172
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,600
But I'll tell you what the CIA is nothing.

173
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm coming for the CIA and I'm coming for Bob Dobbs.

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,140
You heard it first.

175
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
News at 11.

176
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,880
And I think the best assessment of the JFK hit was probably that presented by Oliver Stone in this movie.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,160
JFK was the former chief of staff for Special Operations.

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,240
Colonel Fletcher Prouty's input.

179
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,640
He was, of course, Mr. X in that movie.

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,360
That was his view.

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,100
And Ruth Patterson's North Carolina macaroni and cheese.

182
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,780
I got to tell you, man, I love church.

183
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,880
I just love church.

184
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,640
Bob.

185
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,060
Bob.

186
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,480
Love church.

187
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,760
Totally.

188
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,460
Yes, giving.

189
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
Yes, giving.

190
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,980
Bob.

191
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,560
I love this guy.

192
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
Come join the fun.

193
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,020
All of you have heard of Bob.

194
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,420
Love church.

195
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,840
I got to tell you, it makes you feel real big.

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,700
Go, go, go.

197
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,060
Love church.

198
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,780
Bob.

199
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,500
Yes, giving.

200
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,980
Yes, giving.

201
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,500
Bob.

202
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,420
Come join the fun.

203
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,520
All of you have heard of Bob.

204
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
Love church.

205
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,000
It makes you feel real big.

206
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,080
Yes, .

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,980
Yes, .

208
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Bob.

209
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,040
Go, go, go.

210
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,780
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

211
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,680
We all thought you were dead.

212
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,160
No, no.

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Still here.

214
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
Well, I'll get you to work.

215
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,900
How are you, Bob?

216
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,300
Now, you might ask yourself, why this sudden concern?

217
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,940
Pornography and sex deviation have always been with mankind.

218
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,060
This is true.

219
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,080
In the past few years, this obscenity traffic and salacious newsstand literature

220
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,120
has become increasingly worse, not only in content, but in...

221
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,860
Do they understand what's happening?

222
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,540
Does anybody know what's happening?

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, I know, I know what's happening.

225
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,460
We'll be celebrating the death of, yeah, the guy that's on one coin.

226
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,640
And the guy who'll never make it to a coin, Bob.

227
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
Ivan Stang here tonight, the overman Philo Drummond,

228
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,520
members of Negative Land, members of his church and subgenius,

229
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
all once again gathered inside the secret hideout.

230
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,960
And we'll be discussing certain church secrets here,

231
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,920
as we always do before the end of the year.

232
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,600
As you know, every two years we gather.

233
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,040
It used to be in Arkansas.

234
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,340
Now it's here in space.

235
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,320
Our scene shifts now to Onionopolis.

236
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
Very easy.

237
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,800
Capital of the United Socialist Republic of Leeks and Onions.

238
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,640
Roy.

239
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,960
It's a storm of lies.

240
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,080
A hurricane of lies you're living in every day.

241
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,820
Personally, I don't think so.

242
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,580
I think the critical documentation is probably gone,

243
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,820
if there ever was any documentation.

244
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,860
The people who really...

245
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,820
I think the people who really do, I believe, are all dead.

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,540
All we can do at this point is piece together this puzzle

247
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,720
and kind of see a picture, if we step back from it a little bit,

248
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,020
we can kind of see the picture from a distance

249
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,540
and be able to put it together.

250
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,140
I think that whether or not you believe in a conspiracy,

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,040
and some people still don't, as you know,

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,580
there are a lot of people who believe the Warren Commission.

253
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,740
Yeah, I got something to say.

254
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,040
Here it is right now.

255
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,640
Check this out, Bob Dobbs.

256
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,900
Hello, Bob.

257
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,280
This is baby Rick.

258
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm going to kill you.

259
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,820
Yeah, that's right, Dobbs.

260
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,220
You hear that?

261
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,740
That's just one of two.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,980
Here's the next voice.

263
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,420
Hello, I'm Bob Dobbs.

264
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,060
Look at me.

265
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,840
Look at me.

266
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,340
I'm cool.

267
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,420
All right, here's another voice.

268
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,840
Hey, look at me.

269
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm Bob Dobbs.

270
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,780
Take that.

271
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,440
was a little Bobby.

272
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,180
Oh, Bob.

273
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,580
Oh, Bob.

274
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh, Bob.

275
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,120
Oh, Bob.

276
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,280
Oh, Bob.

277
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,360
Oh, Bob.

278
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


279
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


280
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,720
The corporations themselves receive corporate welfare,

281
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,380
corporate television, corporate money.

282
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,620
They're corporate fascists.

283
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,220
It's all true.

284
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,620
George, feel good.

285
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
It's flying out.

286
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let it lie around.

287
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,420
George, will you tell me what to do?

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
It comes naturally.

289
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,980
Ron, PR News in Washington, unfiring tear gas and pushing back the crowd.

290
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,240
But Pennsylvania Governor Ed Wendell announced that the 34-nation summit of the Americas

291
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,660
and Argentina failed to revive PR News in Washington.

292
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,180
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

293
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,360
You serve them chilled on food picks.

294
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,700
Canned mushroom caps can be marinated in a saucepan.

295
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,480
And so can tiny canned shrimp in the same oil and lemon juice dressing.

296
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,240
Which controls half of the planet Venus.

297
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,560
We are in the office of the Secretary General of the Party, a large fat white onion named Odor.

298
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,840
This traffic continues to increase and flourish for one reason.

299
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,700
It is big business.

300
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,700
It is big business.

301
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:06,700


302
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,500
And that bit about the Secret Service driver, who was a protestant from Ireland, by the way.

303
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,280
He lived on Henry Cabot Lodge's estate, who Kennedy defeated twice.

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,980
He turned around to watch Kennedy get hit.

305
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,620
But the frames of that are missing.

306
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
We know they should be there.

307
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,760
There's too many of them.

308
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,180
Too many.

309
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,580
many and you're forced to look for alternate explanations. I mean we don't

310
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,040
have this many coincidences in normal life under normal circumstances.

311
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,140
A

312
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,520
lie is a hurricane of lies you're living in every day.

313
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,680
For some reason, for the assassination

314
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,780
they multiply like crazy.

315
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,500
I think you still have to look at it that there might be something deeper

316
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,480
underlying the assassination. A deeper kind of force that was

317
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,200
at work that brought all of these coincidences together, all of these people together

318
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,760
to create this condition.

319
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,260
My only pleasure is tormenting those people

320
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,220
who work for me. All your memories about your wife and your daughter are false

321
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,020
and are more like a dream. And God bless us all.

322
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,240
Donads are useful for their purpose.

323
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,260
You're gonna die, sir. Good luck with your layoffs, alright? I hope your firing's

324
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,820
going really well. Bye, friend. Can your heart stand

325
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,020
the shocking facts about grave robbers

326
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,380
from outer space? I like the tingling. Juice me, I'm a

327
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,540
shiver boy. I got secret needles in my

328
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,340
pokey glove. Hurry! Hello, Americans, this is Paul Harvey.

329
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,700
Stand by for news. Hi, man.

330
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,280
Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie. And hippies suck.

331
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,020
Fuck.

332
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,320
We take you back now just for a moment to look at these pictures that we're seeing

333
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,120
and a huge, uh, hip, hip, hip, hip. We have to finish the security

334
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,460
of the United States of America. John Kerry defended a fellow terrorist.

335
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,460
Jack Murther was a coward in Vietnam, and he

336
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,600
deserves to be vilified, not respected.

337
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,480
And the saying just said,

338
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,160
do you think? Uh, no, I'm not thinking.

339
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,640
The fuck? Uh, back there in California.

340
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,740
Now, man, all we need to talk about detergent, deodorant, and how to clean up the society.

341
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Well, this show is the enema for a society that's...

342
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
And unlike, uh, the...

343
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,940
Unlike that fall he had to take for a whole coach,

344
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,340
Andre the Giant really did get his ass kicked by Bob Josh.

345
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,580
Oh, look at that.

346
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,300
He got his ass kicked when Bob ran behind him and kicked it real hard and then ran off real quick, but...

347
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,480
Andre the Giant, uh, eventually caught up with him and...

348
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,360
Yeah, he...

349
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,420
He made some sounds. Made a bunch of painful sounds.

350
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Made a bunch of sounds.

351
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,740
Well, you know, I was... I wanted to talk about that bunch of pills.

352
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah, the bucket of pills.

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,060
And I wanted to talk about Naughty Dallas.

354
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,800
That night where he drank the bucket of pills...

355
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
That was so amazing.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
The pill sauce... The pill chainsaw sauce pudding.

357
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,220
Topping.

358
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,960
Condiment juice.

359
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,720
It's a floor wax.

360
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,460
Yeah, we've got... Got a pill here.

361
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,140
And there's a bucket of pills over there.

362
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,960
And there's a big four-foot pill over there.

363
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,560
It's a giant pill. It's a pill too big to swallow.

364
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Now, in keeping with the, uh, questions that the caller has asked, um...

365
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,460
Can the drug company make a pill that's too big for a human to swallow?

366
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,440
Or God to swallow? One of the two.

367
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,140
And here on the show, we can answer those questions.

368
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,860
We can tell you what the pool of blood was.

369
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,180
We can tell you why it's called Six Floors Over Dallas now.

370
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,640
Yeah, can you tell us about the shaded relief behind the grassy knoll?

371
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
We can tell you why K-Rob is here but quiet.

372
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
Which led to the assassination.

373
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,980
Now, do you know the degree of slope facing the grassy knoll?

374
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,840
There you go. Or say you're in the Daltex building on the second floor.

375
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,640
What's the degree of declination as the car moves away from you?

376
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,760
Well, I think you have to...

377
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,360
Take a four... I think it's 22.9 times 20,000 divided by 1 to the 50th.

378
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,920
There we go. And we'll work that out.

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,800
And in one hour and a half, we'll have our answer.

380
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,860
Because we're only allowed to use computers that were available in 1963 on this portion of the show.

381
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,260
Yeah, and you can see on this topographic map of, uh...

382
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,100
By the way, I meant to ask you, Mr. Overman.

383
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Yes, sir?

384
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,020
Where were you on that morning?

385
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,740
It would have been morning then.

386
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,860
Where was I?

387
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,660
Yeah. Half an hour into the afternoon there.

388
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Well, I was having breakfast on that morning, that fateful morning.

389
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,760
Oh, where was... Oh, in reality.

390
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,040
In reality. Oh, yeah, just... This is for the audience, not the reality.

391
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,000
I was in my little schoolyard suit, dusting off my little culture browns.

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,380
Right. Your little serge wool shorts and CPO jacket and camel hair hat.

393
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,080
Right. That's right. That's exactly right.

394
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,000
Meanwhile, up north, Ramsey Clark, the Attorney General, is walking into his office.

395
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,740
Major General Clinton.

396
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,140
All I knew was that...

397
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,220
Chester v. Ted...

398
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,940
Our president...

399
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,340
Clinton...

400
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,300
Had been shot.

401
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,740
Yep. Everybody in those days had a three-name nickname with quotes around it.

402
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,480
In Clinton's case, it was Ted. In Dobbs' case, it was Bob.

403
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,660
And that's one thing we've never, ever talked about, and maybe the public is ready to know what happened.

404
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,260
Where was Bob when Kennedy was shot?

405
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,840
He benefited from it till today.

406
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,800
Thanks.

407
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,160
He did?

408
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,220
Yeah. Bob has benefited from just about everything till today.

409
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,180
But on tonight's show, we'll reveal...

410
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,720
Secrets that have never been revealed before.

411
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,780
No, we won't.

412
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,440
I knew Tim Garrison. I met him in 1969.

413
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,800
He's a madman.

414
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
We won't?

415
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,440
My Xerox, my smudgy 13-page Xerox here says...

416
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,540
I can see...

417
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,440
My Xerox is only 12 pages. Now, what's the missing page that I have?

418
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,320
I don't know. I think that's the one about the pool of blood.

419
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,240
Let's go.

420
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,640
And wait a minute. I'm confused.

421
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
There was a pool of blood and a bucket of blood.

422
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,140
Pills.

423
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,980
Now, which one of those is...

424
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,240
I thought this was...

425
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,060
The...

426
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,800
Where's the bucket?

427
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,520
The pool of blood may be connected to the headless golf player.

428
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,380
All right.

429
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,540
Dumb ass.

430
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,940
Doing dumb stuff.

431
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,640
Dumb mom.

432
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,520
Dumb to dumb.

433
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,400
Kind of dumb.

434
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,040
Dumb shit.

435
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,140
We don't like to talk about it, but we do it.

436
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,820
Dumb ass.

437
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,900
Dumb things I do.

438
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,720
Dumb to dumb.

439
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,560
Dumb to dumb.

440
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,140
Dumb stuff.

441
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,940
But we do dumb stuff, don't we?

442
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,440
And we don't like to admit it.

443
00:21:59,720 --> 00:21:59,920
Dumb shit.

444
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,960
Really dumb stuff.

445
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,840
Dumb ass.

446
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,940
Hold out his gun.

447
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Dumb, dumb, da-da-dumb, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum.

448
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Crush me.

449
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,000
This is a wannabe criminals.

450
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
KKK dumb things we do.

451
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,540
Dumb.

452
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,000
Do it.

453
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,660
Um, for some immediate gratification, do it.

454
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,000
Go ahead.

455
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,600
Do it.

456
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,460
Evil desires.

457
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,420
Do it.

458
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,880
Did you hear that?

459
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,640
Flirt with a great disaster.

460
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,740
Meetings alone with the opposite sex.

461
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,580
I can handle it.

462
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,480
I wanna sleep with you.

463
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,880
But.

464
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,780
Did you hear that?

465
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,780
It was art.

466
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,060
It was modern art.

467
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,980
The minute I thank beautiful woman in a bikini.

468
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,400
Grow.

469
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,220
Go off.

470
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,680
I like watching pornography on the internet.

471
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,340
I like it.

472
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,080
How close can I come?

473
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,340
Flirting with you.

474
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,720
Whatever.

475
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,640
Come on.

476
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,720
Don't worry.

477
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
I wanna sleep with you.

478
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
And you have to do it.

479
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,140
Hey listen.

480
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,240
Sud in the hole.

481
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,860
So let us come get pooped.

482
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,380
Flintstones.

483
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,480
Get pooped out.

484
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,920
Dumb songs or commercials that we'd like to forget.

485
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,500
Thought.

486
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,420
I mean, you know, you gotta take a break here.

487
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,980
Pooped out.

488
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,100
Drastic measure.

489
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,100
Flirt a little bit with.

490
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,200
Why would he do that?

491
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,880
So let us come.

492
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,380
He came and he did it.

493
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,360
Do the dumb stuff.

494
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,060
Did you hear that?

495
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,540
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

496
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,440
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

497
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,100
We've flown it.

498
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,760
We've flown it.

499
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,100
There.

500
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,660
Let me tell you some dumb stuff.

501
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
I've done a lot of dumb things.

502
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,340
Thank you for dying.

503
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,420
What happened to the executive retreat we were supposed to.

504
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,300
I thought we were supposed to get a meal tonight here.

505
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,920
Well, we're playing.

506
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
Yeah, well, all that's down the drain.

507
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,940
Really?

508
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,440
What happened with the meal issue?

509
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,140
I mean, I thought.

510
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,820
I don't know.

511
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,380
The turkey.

512
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,300
The dressing.

513
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,680
I was up in the booth and I introduced Stang and lo and behold, he wasn't here.

514
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,720
And so we had to play a tape of him and now he's here and he sounds.

515
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,440
Well, are we still gonna have to go over the budget?

516
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,940
He is here.

517
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,960
Just like a tape.

518
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,020
White five.

519
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,380
White five.

520
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,640
Look, that's a joke.

521
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,120
White five?

522
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,460
White five?

523
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:33,780
I'm not even bothered.

524
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,680
Stang, would you like to make some opening remarks to this banquet celebration?

525
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
I guess so.

526
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,440
I mean, how would you introduce the subgenius to, say, the complete neophyte?

527
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:57,100
Your doom has finally come and in the long run, it'll do you a lot of good if your existence

528
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,340
ends now.

529
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,760
But is there any money in it?

530
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,900
That's actually our message to the...

531
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,520
Well, the second portal of entry...

532
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,780
...those who refuse to believe in the word of Bob as represented by the Church of the

533
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:16,480
Subgenius, which is the world's first industrial religion founded in the 1950s by the mystic

534
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,000
super salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs.

535
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,200
But is there any money in it?

536
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,000
But there's tons of...

537
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,760
What do you mean, is there money in it?

538
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,340
It is of money.

539
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,420
It is composed entirely.

540
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,320
It is an integral part of the world.

541
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,320


542
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,600
It is an edifice made of coins and dollar bills, you might say.

543
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,720
Then why am I paying for everything?

544
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,540
Well, metaphorically, why is he...

545
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,660
Pardon me?

546
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,800
Why am I paying for all this food?

547
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,580
Where is the food?

548
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,680
I mean, if you're paying for it, why aren't we eating it?

549
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,100
It's upstairs, man.

550
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,540
It's upstairs.

551
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,900
It's cool.

552
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,600
It's being prepared.

553
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,380
Okay, so we are going to eat before we leave, right?

554
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,560
Oh, yeah.

555
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,860
Now, will that be after or before the budget seminar?

556
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,700
After, after.

557
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,060
And what happens is the Bobbies are watching the entire time.

558
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,780
They're sitting right over there at that big table.

559
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,280
Now, they can't hear me, but the deal is they have to figure out that they too can come

560
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,600
over and share the meal with the lower arpy.

561
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,120
If they don't figure it out, they get a...

562
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,500
Especially the she-Bobbies.

563
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,320
The she-Bobbies.

564
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,020
As far as I'm concerned.

565
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,820
Now, will that include the second portal of entry that can be utilized for biological

566
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,780
agent employment in the skin?

567
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,220
You see, the Bobbies don't figure it out.

568
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,420
Get the 10-gallon lunch.

569
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,340
Excuse me.

570
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,260
Excuse me.

571
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,840
What?

572
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,860
Oh, no.

573
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,500
Bob's here.

574
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,100
Run!

575
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,180
Let's have those spaceman generals.

576
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,640
Run.

577
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,300
I was thinking of Bob, but that's not him.

578
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,300


579
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,740
Oh, that's not him.

580
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,200
Oh, God.

581
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,180
It sounded just like him for a second, then.

582
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:44,080
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

583
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

584
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:56,620


585
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm extremely dangerous.

586
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,740
The U.S. military says about 3,500 troops are meeting to discuss economic issues.

587
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,960
Their objective is to set fire to a street in advance of the December 15th explosion.

588
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,520
You're listening to PR News.

589
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,640
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

590
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,480
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

591
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:50,500
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

592
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:20,500
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

593
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:50,500
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

594
00:28:51,580 --> 00:29:20,480
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

595
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:50,500
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

596
00:29:50,520 --> 00:30:20,500
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

597
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:49,920
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

598
00:30:51,560 --> 00:31:20,480
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

599
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,460
The Claude

600
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,120
the length of a crack.

601
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:37,320
the length of a crack.

602
00:31:50,520 --> 00:32:01,500
For the purposes of this seminar, this definition of vector is limited to subgeni.

603
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,500
What the hell are you talking about?

604
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm talking about drafting principles for overlay preparation.

605
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,560
What do you think I'm talking about?

606
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,720
I thought we were going to talk about the budget for this godforsaken church.

607
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,740
And I do mean literally godforsaken.

608
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,700
Well, I hope you're ready to go through line item after line item.

609
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,180
He seems to have ignored us completely.

610
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,600
I hate that.

611
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,380
Okay, now.

612
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,740
I mean, it was bad enough when he ignored our prayers.

613
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,060
Yep.

614
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:35,160
But to ignore our declaration of outright war.

615
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,000
It's an insult.

616
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,120
It is an insult.

617
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,540
It really is.

618
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,860
And let me tell you something, Bob, real quick.

619
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,460
Let me tell you something.

620
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,180
Bob.

621
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:41,960
Yes.

622
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,700
Okay, let me break that down.

623
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,140
Philo.

624
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,000
Bob.

625
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,140
Okay, Don.

626
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,220
Bob.

627
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,100
All right, here we go.

628
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,600
Here's the point.

629
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,380
Bob.

630
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:49,780
Bob.

631
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm going to come down there.

632
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,000
Bob.

633
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,820
Anyway.

634
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,400
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

635
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm going to take two flapjacks.

636
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm going to take a piece of sausage and a bacon.

637
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,980
You're right.

638
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,660
I'm going to breakfast you.

639
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,640
Okay, is this some kind of party?

640
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,020
What's Reverend Stans?

641
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,180
Reverend Stans, what does this mean?

642
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,960
What kind of church is this?

643
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,180
Where's the old preaching?

644
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:25,400
If you want to find out what kind of church this is, meet us behind the Linwood Library at 730.

645
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,020
You'll find out.

646
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Bring all your boys.

647
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,460
Bring the Johnson boys and family.

648
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,940
Any pro you want to take.

649
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
We're ready.

650
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,080
Bring Jerry Falwell.

651
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,800
Yeah.

652
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,580
Bring Pat Robertson.

653
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,060
Bring on Jimmy Swagger.

654
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,260
Actually, it's been a long time since I've partied with Jimmy Swagger.

655
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,800
You know, he's from back...

656
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,740
He is back on television, too.

657
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
He's back in the news.

658
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,440
Jimmy Swagger's back in the news?

659
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,120
Yeah.

660
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,040
Yeah, join in on the...

661
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,980
Actually, I'm so far behind.

662
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,760
I haven't been keeping up with my rival cult news.

663
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,540
Yeah.

664
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,880
You don't need to anymore.

665
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,440
Now that you're an ascended master of your own church, you don't need to worry about that.

666
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,980
No, I'm the top clerk of Bob Dobbs' cult.

667
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,480
Oh, okay.

668
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,780
I see.

669
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:18,780


670
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,000
Sorry.

671
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:27,020
So I haven't had time to enjoy any of the juicy gossip, or goosey jossip, we call it.

672
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,920
I didn't call it jargon.

673
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,120
Yeah, goosey jossip.

674
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,400
About our rival religious nuts.

675
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,020
Yeah, and the jossip part is really the best part.

676
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,740
The Church of the Subgenius is not really in competition with any of the other major world religions or fringe cults.

677
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,760
You can...

678
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,400
We have a lot of overlap with almost...

679
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
We have a lot of overlap with almost all of them as it is.

680
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,640
You're hearing it real time.

681
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,500
We scratch your hindbrain and you scratch ours, or however that works.

682
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,240
As long as we're the picture.

683
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,080
What about this one?

684
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,040
No, it's the same thing.

685
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
It is the same thing.

686
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:01,520
Yes, comrade.

687
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,520
We are a number of churches and a number of influences right here, right now, because

688
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,900
I actually went out to Dallas the first time to go see the Dealey Plaza, to breathe in

689
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,580
the air of the scene back when nobody cared about it.

690
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,780
Back before yogurt was an American thing.

691
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:18,780


692
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:18,780


693
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,500
Before yogurt?

694
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,420
Well, in the sense that Danone had started shipping about two years before and it was

695
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,960
slowly coming across the U.S. and I'm thinking, I've eaten yogurt.

696
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,720
No American's going to eat yogurt.

697
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,140
Though I didn't realize they dumped so much sugar in our version that everybody was going

698
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,160
to eat it.

699
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,400
Yes, Bob Dog's invented yogurt and the Church of the Subgenius.

700
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,200
And how to evaluate it.

701
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,640
One day I will kill you.

702
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
I will kill you.

703
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I will do that one of these days.

704
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Talk is deep.

705
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,680
If you don't shut up, I'll, I'll, I'll kill you, little evil one.

706
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,980
Trying to drive me out of my mind.

707
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,840
I will kill you.

708
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,860
Now get out of here.

709
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,120
Get out or I'll kill you.

710
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,780
I did kill again.

711
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,780
I'll kill you.

712
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,560
I'll kill you.

713
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,620
I'll kill you.

714
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,340
I killed him.

715
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,720
I killed him.

716
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:17,720


717
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:17,820
I killed him.

718
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


719
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


720
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,820


721
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,120
No, I'm happy.

722
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,800
Well, that's something I hope we can cover tonight.

723
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
You just got to think about that methodology, you know.

724
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,580
You got to get back in there.

725
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,340
You got to think about which process you're going to use.

726
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,220
There's a certain amount of business we should be covering this evening.

727
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,700
Boring, I know, but it's important to cover.

728
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,840
Yeah, or how you going to interpret the written information.

729
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,320
As opposed to the data.

730
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,820
We're trying to replace the written information.

731
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,720
We're trying to replace the written information with pictos.

732
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,460
Instead of using English, we're trying to switch over to the subgenius hieroglyphs,

733
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:02,540
which take up a lot less space and have so many...

734
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,760
You mean those little icons in the Bobco font?

735
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
It has almost no nuances.

736
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,040
It's the opposite of the English language.

737
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,960
It puts things bluntly.

738
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,880
Is it like the Hagen-Dazs?

739
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,280
Perhaps a little too bluntly for the polished ears of the modernist.

740
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah.

741
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,240
The liberal, the conservative, the human.

742
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,880
Why don't you answer the phone, you moron?

743
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,020
Phone!

744
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
You no longer need to answer the phone.

745
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,740
This is a religion, not a hair shop.

746
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Why don't you answer your phone, Mr. Collar?

747
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,820
And just who did kill Kennedy, Collar?

748
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,740
I killed Kennedy.

749
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,840
Well, can you confess now on the air and tell us why?

750
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,660
No, I didn't actually kill Kennedy.

751
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,500
Put us all out of our misery.

752
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,540
Okay, why don't you guys...

753
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,820
Why don't they call him Robert Kennedy?

754
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,420
No, we're just going to cover the one.

755
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,020
After all, it was you and me.

756
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,720
Why are we talking about the death of Robert Kennedy?

757
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,260
Well, that one, we can't talk about that until April, obviously.

758
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,900
Quick question real quick.

759
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,300
All right, we got two Bobcats.

760
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,040
This one has to be talked about on its anniversary.

761
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:11,260
And today is not only Thanksgiving, but it's the reason I met these guys when I went to Dallas.

762
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
Okay, I agree, but let me tell you something.

763
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,220
Well, okay.

764
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,060
Bobcats.

765
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,400
This is a lot of fun.

766
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,340
And I'm not saying it's not the same Collar.

767
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,500
If I was any younger, I'd come down there and I would pick a flapjack with a blind cap.

768
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,000
And I would take some maple syrup.

769
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,340
It would be pretty good.

770
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,060
And these pancakes I sell are about $3.50, $4.00.

771
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,860
I'm having a gas attack.

772
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm having an ass attack.

773
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,900
I mean, a donkey is attacking me.

774
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,580
Sex on the streets in every major city from coast to coast.

775
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,820
That's in fact...

776
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,220
What a dumb thing to do.

777
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,580
I bet you wouldn't have done anything like this if Mom and Dad were here.

778
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,500
Hi, Mom.

779
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm pregnant.

780
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,220
Do what you want to the girl, but leave me alone.

781
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,300
Emotions are for ethnic people.

782
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,860
From PR news in Washington, I'm Dresta Today on human rights and corruption charges, including alleged support of a paramilitary death squad.

783
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,420
On Wall Street 5-6, the U.S. military says it's abusing PRs in Iraq.

784
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,040
The photos show U.S. soldiers humiliating and otherwise mistreating PR news.

785
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,800
Former Peruvian President Jair Bolsonaro said,

786
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,220
Alberto Fujimori set fire to a bus and held up police with PR News, Washington.

787
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:27,280
Speaking of the Kennedy assassination, friends, the ultimate sacrifice can now be yours.

788
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,960
Actually, the book, Ultimate Sacrifice, by Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman, is out now.

789
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,820
And I have been waiting for this book for...

790
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,780
Well, I've known Lamar Waldron for a long time.

791
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:43,780


792
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,040
I've known Lamar Waldron for about 17 years, and that's how long he's been working on Ultimate Sacrifice.

793
00:39:49,920 --> 00:40:05,880
It was finally published in hardback by Carroll and Graff Publishers, and you can find out all you need to know at a website called ultimatesacrificethebook.com.

794
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,480
One word, ultimate sacrifice the book.

795
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,640
Ultimate Sacrifice.

796
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,880
John and Robert Kennedy, the plan for a coup in Cuba and the murder of JFK.

797
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,220
Friends, it's a whole different look at the Kennedy assassination than what you may be used to.

798
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:37,700
I can't even begin to go into the depths of the research and all of that, because this is the hour of slack, and the Kennedy assassination isn't slackful for everybody.

799
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,740
But I've been...

800
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,800
I've been around it for a long time.

801
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,920
And this is...

802
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,800
You know, if you're really seriously looking for answers, I...

803
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,220
You could...

804
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,240
You should definitely check out Ultimate Sacrifice.

805
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,300
The case is not closed, but this one comes close.

806
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,000
ultimatesacrificethebook.com.

807
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,400
Have I...

808
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,620
Have I...

809
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:32,140
Leave my thoughts, didn't I tell you this would be the

810
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,620
official last minute movie?

811
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,860
My beautiful family.

Thank you.

813
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,720

drinks go dancing with him i don't get it restaurant we're in the baby boomer generation

817
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:17,980
i think this would require infiltration i think we should like join pat robertson's cult

818
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:24,260
work our way up from the inside until we infiltrate the properties of our organization

819
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,260
that way that's the only way we're going to meet these budget commitments we have here today

833
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,380

23rd, I think.

866
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,500
The first show, 1982.

867
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,040
More and more daylight.

868
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,960
We had copper tops.

869
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,900
And yet we must save slack in the great slack batteries.

870
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,620
The great dynamos in Dobstown must be charged with your slack.

871
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,220
You must give it up to Bob that we may store it.

872
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,080
For later.

873
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,180
We'll give it back to you.

874
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,180
Amplified.

875
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,420
Oh, this is how we do it.

876
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,520
Only bad radio will suck the evil poison of good culture.

877
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,900
I would be wrong, would he?

878
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,720
How much does it cost?

879
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,920
I want one.

880
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,260
$20 a month.

881
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,000
Cool.

882
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,920
$400 a month.

883
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,380
Is there a mortgage payment on it?

884
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,240
There's a mortuary what?

885
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,500
A mortuary payment.

886
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,700
Oh, yeah.

887
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,880
If you send us $600 now, we will keep you.

888
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,140
We will keep you in urns for 2,000 years.

889
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,360
Not stored in any soul.

890
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,700
Don't you have to be burned to be put in an urn?

891
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,440
That's right.

892
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,120
This is an outrage, a national insult.

893
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:15,860
No.

894
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,460
Yes.

895
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:16,980
No.

896
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,480
Yes.

897
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,860
We're going to burn you down into ash, put you in the urn, and keep you for 2,000.

898
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,360
Our descendants have pre-signed.

899
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,200
But I want speakers inside, you know, and a radio.

900
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,840
You got it.

901
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:28,980
You got it.

902
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,660
I'll get the show broadcast inside my urn.

903
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,840
Yeah, that's right.

904
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,760
Really?

905
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,620
You've got it.

906
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,780
We can arrange this.

907
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,080
We can do anything.

908
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,420
Or your ancestors or your descendants.

909
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,840
That's right.

910
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,000
But I want to be put in orbit.

911
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,760
Your ancestors can be saved.

912
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,140
Okay.

913
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,380
Orbit?

914
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,720
You want, but that's going to be a different.

915
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,420
I want the moon wrecker plan.

916
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:46,680
Posthumously.

917
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,340
Okay.

918
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,960
All right.

919
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,380
But, you know, now you're changing plans.

920
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,700
We're going to have to switch you off to someone, another person in charge of plans.

921
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,040
No.

922
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,320
I like talking to you because I figure I can maybe, like, you know, work you out of it.

923
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah.

924
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,920
Yeah.

925
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,020
Salesman Pepe has a very trustworthy sounding voice.

926
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,680
Yeah.

927
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:04,680


928
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,820
I just sound like one of these.

929
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,140
Do we?

930
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,500
Do we be dumb guys that is really.

931
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,740
Well, not be here tonight.

932
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,200
I'm trying to take advantage of your naive.

933
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:12,900
Yeah.

934
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,140
Exactly.

935
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,140
We will promise to do this.

936
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,020
And I'll tell you, if I have to get fired by my boss, I will give you this deal, man.

937
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,480
Oh, what about your car, too?

938
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,860
All right.

939
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,220
Okay.

940
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,540
But after you're dead, yeah.

941
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,060
Okay.

942
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,120
But you've got to carry me around in your trunk, though.

943
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,040
Yeah.

944
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,760
But, I mean, you have to die before I do.

945
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,820
That's the thing.

946
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,040
And so, no, this probably won't happen.

947
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,140
I'll probably die first.

948
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,600
I like the way it sounds.

949
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,560
You have to die before I do.

950
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:41,840
Yeah.

951
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,280
That has a nice meaning to it.

952
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,220
I think it'll work.

953
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,040
Just generally as a statement.

954
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,560
You know, it worked on a couple of the leads that Philo gave me.

955
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,380
And, yeah, it's just kind of like taking you into my confidence and saying, well, you know,

956
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,900
you know, I killed my mother and father, too.

957
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,280
And I know where you're coming from.

958
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,380
And I can feel your pain.

959
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,080
What is the talk of death and dying and gaining sight?

960
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,940
It all leads to heaven sooner or later.

961
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,560
We're all going to meet in heaven.

962
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,520
But at the same time, we need insurance.

963
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,700
I just want to let people know that we're there as a church to help.

964
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,540
That's right.

965
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,760
It's a form of insurance.

966
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:20,880
Yeah.

967
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,540
Don't you worry about what's going to happen.

968
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,360
I just worry.

969
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,800
I just stay up all night worrying about what's going to happen to my body after I die.

970
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,360
We only worry about how much money you've sent in.

971
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,620
Really?

972
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:33,720
Yeah.

973
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,700
So we can keep track of how many lifetimes.

974
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,020
Yeah.

975
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,800
It's going to be allowed after this one.

976
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,020
Yeah.

977
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,440
Right.

978
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:38,840
Exactly.

979
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,220
That's right.

980
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,560
Bean counters, really.

981
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,340
The more you pay, the more lifetimes you are given.

982
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,280
Bean counters.

983
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,540
Soul lifetimes.

984
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,480
Soul counters.

985
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,760
How the name of Jesus was born.

986
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,780
We can make your soul bigger, too.

987
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,600
That's the whole idea.

988
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,740
That is exactly what it's all about.

989
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,720
It's about making that soul bigger.

990
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,340
We can pump it up.

991
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,620
How?

992
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,700
March your soul.

993
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,460
You know, it's working on you at the moment.

994
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,620
How the name of Jesus.

995
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,880
It's already working.

996
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,120
We're already working in your mind.

997
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,220
It's near the prostate.

998
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,640
In your body.

999
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,140
Work it out.

1000
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,440
This music is already playing.

1001
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,920
It's already been pre-played.

1002
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,160
It's been all pre-played.

1003
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,920
Everything has been predetermined beforehand by the church.

1004
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,660
The forehead expands first.

1005
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,220
Yeah.

1006
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:23,900
The body problems.

1007
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,360
That's right.

1008
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,100
That's right.

1009
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,380
You can feel the hairs.

1010
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,540
You can feel the...

1011
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:27,660
Wow.

1012
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,060
You know, you float off away a little.

1013
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,280
They get bigger and bigger.

1014
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:33,820
Yeah.

1015
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,060
It's...

1016
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,040
Nothing.

1017
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,700
It's a couple of holistic shrines.

1018
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,280
Come with me.

1019
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,260
And you've got to try to hold down.

1020
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,520
Don't allow the air in your brain to lift you off the...

1021
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,380
Another bowl of fine chopped green onions.

1022
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,500
And...

1023
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,140
Another of commercial sour cream.

1024
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,520
And for all time, we will play...

1025
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,640
The soul is expanding and Bob knows how many times it's going to come and go.

1026
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,540
Reporting to you.

1027
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,540
He keeps talking about food.

1028
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Salty rye bread.

1029
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,940
And go.

1030
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,200
To your urn.

1031
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Give the know-how.

1032
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,100
Come on.

1033
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:05,600
Keep on.

1034
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,240
All the ashes in the right urns.

1035
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,820
We don't want to mix any of the souls.

1036
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,300
Bob may become confused.

1037
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,460
We do not mix your urn.

1038
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,220
You've earned an urn.

1039
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,100
You?

1040
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,920
About an urn?

1041
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,080
No, you're yearning to earn something.

1042
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,260
Determine the size of your soul as it marches.

1043
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,540
Urns, right.

1044
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,900
Well, the amount of your urns that you send to the church.

1045
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,100
If you have a big soul, you're going to need a big urn.

1046
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,480
That's right.

1047
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,380
Appropriately.

1048
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,140
It's going to be here.

1049
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,100
It's going to be huge by the time we get through.

1050
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,520
If you want a bigger soul, you're going to have to earn more.

1051
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,940
What's the matter?

1052
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,480
What's the matter?

1053
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,140
I mean, this could cost millions.

1054
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,460
Everything's been a disaster.

1055
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,260
Stay away.

1056
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,720
You're sending the money.

1057
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:46,960
Why?

1058
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,940
It's passed out.

1059
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,140
Me.

1060
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,440
Stay away.

1061
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,800
You're sending the money.

1062
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,720
It's passed out.

1063
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:51,960
Me.

1064
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,580
It's this.

1065
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,220
It's us.

1066
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,840
Fight the conspiracy by doing those things.

1067
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,400
Stay away.

1068
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,000
Number one.

1069
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,700
You have to do that.

1070
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,000
Stay away.

1071
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,820
Don't say no.

1072
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,500
No.

1073
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,620
My eye is in the closet.

1074
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:04,860
I'm all deceased.

1075
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,000
The great Comartes said.

1076
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,020
I'm not sleeping.

1077
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,320
Number two.

1078
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,800
Send in the money.

1079
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,760
Number three.

1080
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,320
What was it?

1081
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh, yeah.

1082
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,340
Cast out the evil one.

1083
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,220
From your own gut.

1084
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,540
Get it out of your liver.

1085
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,180
There is an evil demon of the conspiracy living in your liver.

1086
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,860
And you have got to vomit that thing out.

1087
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,440
The only way to do that is to study Bob's word.

1088
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,760
The only way to do that is to keep earning.

1089
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:33,860
Am I?

1090
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,340
By the way.

1091
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,200
If it's in your liver, then we just kill it with alcohol.

1092
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,640
Cast out the evil one.

1093
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,100
That's right.

1094
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,400
Drive it out using whatever poison you can.

1095
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,620
I understand some types of mushrooms will drive a demon in your liver.

1096
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,960
The so-called liver.

1097
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,040
Electronics.

1098
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,900
Certain bad health plans will do the same thing.

1099
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,720
And alcohol.

1100
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,680
Drive it out.

1101
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,340
Karma.

1102
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,540
Perfect.

1103
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,180
Karma.

1104
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,740
Perfect.

1105
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,640
Now it's like turkey.

1106
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,340
Yes.

1107
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,400
Yes.

1108
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,780
And tank.

1109
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,520
You want to get rid of that soul.

1110
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,100
You want to cleanse it.

1111
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,500
It's like a river.

1112
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,540
Slack is like a river coursing through your body.

1113
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,780
Like a Kundalini snake dragon.

1114
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,800
That bottle.

1115
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,600
That bottle.

1116
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,260
That's Slack.

1117
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,880
So remove the karmic energy of death of you and your local.

1118
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,340
What do you call that, Reverend Stang?

1119
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,920
That river of Slack.

1120
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,660
I call that Slack.

1121
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,940
What do you call that, Stang?

1122
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,520
What's it?

1123
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,560
The orniferous?

1124
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,120
The orniferous.

1125
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1126
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1127
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1128
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1129
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1130
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1131
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1132
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1133
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1134
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1135
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1136
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,120


1137
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,880
The world river.

1138
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,820
Sprinkle some of the green onions.

1139
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,780
The Ouroboros.

1140
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Ouroboros, thank you.

1141
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,460
This whole refrigirant.

1142
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,400
That's right.

1143
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,300
The Ouroboros.

1144
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,700
It's the world river of slack, which you can join and dive into.

1145
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,640
It's the endlessly slow jacking.

1146
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,280
Not just everyone.

1147
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,640
You're always climaxing constantly.

1148
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,400
True slack is like that.

1149
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,780
It's like in that movie Brainstorm when that man made a loop of the orgasm.

1150
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,780
That is slack.

1151
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,840
That's continuous orgasm.

1152
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:18,920
That's like one million times better than that endless orgasm loop.

1153
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,300
Don't you want a little bit of that, friend?

1154
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,980
Don't you want to just get a cut of that?

1155
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,200
A little tiny cut?

1156
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,280
Possibly.

1157
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,360
Undoubtedly, but we will change that point of view.

1158
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,040
Subgenius.com.

1159
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,620
There's no O in subgenius, but there is in com.

1160
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,140
It is a C.

1161
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,380
Is there an O in com?

1162
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,320
Is there an I in denial?

1163
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,260
What was it?

1164
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,140
It is a time and place of com.

1165
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
In the same place there's one in bob.

1166
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,700
Right in the middle.

1167
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,640
Dot piece and dot com.

1168
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,580
Yeah.

1169
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,220
Synthetic piece.

1170
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,960
Church is actually the only church that is a dot com, isn't it?

1171
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,900
Isn't that what the special number came from?

1172
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,620
It's a fraction of a con.

1173
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,300
It's a fraction.

1174
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,380
A fraction.

1175
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,020
It's a fraction of the conspiracy itself.

1176
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,520
But, you know, that's what we're saying.

1177
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,100
You're tainted with the conspiracy.

1178
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,940
The church is tainted with it.

1179
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,820
Everything is tainted except for Bob's pipe.

1180
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,460
That's the one clean place.

1181
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,140
And if you can throw yourself into that pipe and let Bob smoke you.

1182
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,960
That's right.

1183
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,460
You're not smoking Bob.

1184
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,540
You're not going, oh, man, let's get into Bob.

1185
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,180
Get high.

1186
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,800
Yeah.

1187
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,140
No.

1188
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,620
It's the other way around.

1189
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,240
And, you know, the thing is, the pipe is actually,

1190
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,500
the thing doing the smoking.

1191
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:40,060
It's sucking Bob's brain and inhaling it in a smoke-like form into the universe.

1192
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:40,640
Yeah.

1193
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,760
It's a reversed pipe.

1194
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,760
It's a reversed time pipe as well.

1195
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,720
That's proof there, Reverend Simon.

1196
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,020
It's both a slack river and a time river.

1197
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,600
And it goes backwards through Bob's head.

1198
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:00,040
Upwards and through his lungs like an ever-vomiting, perfect, pure,

1199
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,900
pureness of love.

1200
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,460
Perpetual motion.

1201
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,920
It's a perpetual motion of vomited love.

1202
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,920
Yes, a fountain.

1203
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,080
Coming forth from Bob's pipe.

1204
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,740
And it's made of pure brain.

1205
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,100
Being smoked in that thing.

1206
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,520
Made of pure brain.

1207
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,220
You have got to get real.

1208
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,320
This is not some game.

1209
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,940
This isn't some metaphor, some performance art.

1210
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,940
This is real.

1211
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,040
This is your soul we're talking about.

1212
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,600
This is happening.

1213
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,200
It's your income we're talking about.

1214
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,960
And it's the same in general.

1215
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,020
No.

1216
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,020


1217
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,020


1218
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,300
We're talking about you.

1219
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,240
You will.

1220
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,600
Have you willed these notifications from your church?

1221
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,880
Have you thought about it?

1222
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,240
Have you thought about it?

1223
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,460
Have you thought about?

1224
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,280
I have a question for you.

1225
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,500
Look at that breathing down your neck right now.

1226
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,220
He's there.

1227
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,080
He's behind you.

1228
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
The stuckness in your movement is hovering.

1229
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,020
It's about ready to grab you up by the scruff of the neck.

1230
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,220
No!

1231
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,920
I have a statement.

1232
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,240
And that is you have Bob, you're lost.

1233
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,520
You are lost, San Francisco.

1234
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,000
You saw what happened to San Francisco.

1235
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,160
some of the other great cities in this country.

1236
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,200
San Francisco, you better pay attention.

1237
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,400
Berkeley, you hear me? You hear me now?

1238
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,940
San Francisco on line one wants to know

1239
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,160
what can they do to save their sorry, sorry asses now.

1240
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,340
Thank you.

1241
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,080
A tribute to this marvelous radio station carries the word of Bob.

1242
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,760
Paint the golden bridge golden.

1243
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,960
The next thing they can do is tuck their head between their knees

1244
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,020
and kiss their fanny goodbye.

1245
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,700
And they join the church of the subgenius for real

1246
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,680
and show Bob they really believe.

1247
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,240
Signing their name on that dotted line on that check.

1248
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:46,040
And would that entitle them to all of the privileges

1249
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,020
that other subgeniuses would derive,

1250
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,140
as well as the microorganisms?

1251
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,320
No, because each subgenius has its own type of privileges and slap.

1252
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,520
It's different.

1253
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,160
It's different for each one.

1254
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,760
For some, it's a terrible rip-off.

1255
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,500
For some, it's an endless pit of bad feelings.

1256
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,320
But by the way,

1257
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,380
but by the way, we missed the ID again.

1258
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,940
No, the ID! We missed the ID!

1259
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm started by a discarded cigarette.

1260
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,920
Catholic Archbishop Sean O'Malley is calling for an end to homosexuals.

1261
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,500
He said,

1262
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
O'Malley says he doesn't want homosexuals personally.

1263
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,840
O'Malley is hostile to homosexuals,

1264
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,140
but views banning gay men as important for children from Madrid.

1265
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,060
The Dow Jones 666.

1266
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,240
The Spanish government says it is ignoring PR News in Washington.

1267
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,500
So help me, Bob.

1268
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,380
Come over, Bob.

1269
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,780
This Bob, this Bob, this Bob is the president of the, uh,

1270
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:49,880
uh,

1271
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,680
later on Bob.

1272
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,600
No doubt we should have a interesting era there.

1273
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,320
That's Bob.

1274
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,640
But now I've got a,

1275
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,260
a little joke for you, Bob.

1276
00:58:59,380 --> 00:58:59,980
Get you, Bob.

1277
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,480
I've got another joke here for you, Bob.

1278
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,380
Active Bob.

1279
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,180
You're free to go.

1280
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,860
So help me, Bob.

1281
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm both at the same time.

1282
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,820
The huge storm system that produced the past few days,

1283
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,540
National Weather Service forecaster Peter says,

1284
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,860
You've got a cold front moving eastward and northward and

1285
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,400
snowplows try to restore electricity to hundreds of thousands of miles of interstate highways.

1286
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,620
Vice President,

1287
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,680
President Dickey advocates the use of PR News in Washington.
