1
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,240
But now at the beginning of the 1980s, I want to make another personal prediction.

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,880
The 1980s will be the most catastrophic decade in the history of man.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,420
And yet no one who will accept what God has to say has to be afraid.

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:47,060
As a matter of fact, you can be so excited that every day can be a day where you are not only optimistic,

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,320
but saying, this might be the day. This may be it.

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,660
And in the meanwhile, God has promised that as we claim his promises,

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,980
he will sustain us even in the day.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,220
This is one of the darkest hours of history.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,700
And give us a way out.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,100
Time for show. Live show for you now.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,520
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,740
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,300
Hour of Slap.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,820
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,280
The past year resembles nothing so much as the bad alternate timeline

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,020
that the hero of a cheap science fiction book has to go back and fix.

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,620
And you, the listener, are that time traveler.

19
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,420
If only your memory could be restored to you.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,980
You are the listener.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,500
You are the humble time traveler.

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,200
I know what you mean, though.

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,880
It does...

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Yeah, that would explain a lot.

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,340
It would explain the wooden-headed people coming up to us

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,360
while we're taking our sulfur baths.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,160
It would certainly explain all the money that's now going to be flowing into arms.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,500
And legs.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,240
And think of how fully well laundered that money is.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,180
It must be very squeaky clean by now.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,740
Just think about George, the bushy-haired one himself,

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
and counting that money back in some room.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,200
He's got to replace those behind the oval orifice.

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,240
That's not what this is all about.

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,500
No.

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,620
It's all about revenge.

37
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,380
That's it.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Taking over Mars.

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,200
Yes.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,800
Eventually, to take over...

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
To take back Mars.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,820
Take over Mars.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,760
To take Mars back.

45
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,100
Our rightful home.

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,060
That we, the true Martians, were expelled from.

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,960
So that they, the oil sheiks, and the oil billionaires,

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,880
and all the oily characters,

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,860
would have some...

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,620
They did...

51
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,120
So we're living in the Martian time slip?

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,420
Oh, I can grok to that.

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,540
In this time continuum.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,720
I can grok to that, my water brother,

55
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,040
but by the same token, when do we...

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,740
We were enslaved.

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,000
We've got to go back in time and kill Bob's mom.

58
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,060
The psychic shackles...

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
They came and took us off our home.

60
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,260
After Bob was born.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,940
Exslaid thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago.

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,580
Does this mean that there's a big deal with all the money we want

63
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,780
here at the front of our house,

64
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,780
and we can pick it up and just...

65
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,220
It doesn't mean anything like that.

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,440
No, man.

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,620
It just means that we were kidnapped,

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:29,960
and we're going to be kidnapped.

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:29,960


70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
We're going to be kidnapped from our home world,

71
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,860
and we're stuck here with you twerps.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,220
Yeah, you guys.

73
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,640
You just...

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
You guys.

75
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,840
Go ahead.

76
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Make my...

77
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,460
Bob?

78
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,740
Right.

79
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,260
Now.

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,020
Ha ha.

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,800
I am an antichrist.

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,340
I am an anarchist.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,820
Don't know what I want,

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,180
but I know how to get it.

85
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,000
I want to destroy the passerby.

86
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:24,560
Cause I want to be anarchy.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,060
I want to be an anarchist.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,280
No.

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,520
No.

90
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,260
Dog's body.

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
Anarchy.

92
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,040
For the UK.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,660
It's coming sometime.

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,760
Maybe.

95
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,520
I give a wrong time.

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
Stop a traffic line.

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
Your future dream is a shopping scheme.

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,260
Cause I want to be anarchy.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,800
In.

100
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,440
The.

101
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,820
City.

102
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,760
How many ways to get what you want.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,260
I use a ashtray.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:47,160
The best I use the rest I use the enemy I use anarchy cause I wanna be anarchy

105
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,640
The only way to be

106
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,460
Is this the MPLA?

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,080
Or is this the UD?

108
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,140
UD?

109
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,140


110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,140


111
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,140


112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,460
A

113
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,880
Or is this the IRA?

114
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,800
I thought it was the UK

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,260
Or just

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,060
Another

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,540
Country

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,160
Another

119
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,840
Council

120
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,500
Tenancy

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,520
I

122
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,700
Wanna be

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,680
Anarchy

124
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,040
It's time to rule!

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,560
Mistdrop

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,560


127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,560


128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,260
التعامل

129
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,300
Anarchy

130
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,340
Anarchy

131
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,380
Anarchy

132
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,420
Anarchy

133
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,460
Anarchy

134
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,500
Anarchy

135
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,040
Anarchy

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,140
Anarchy

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:25,440
which is where we subgeniuses sometimes throw all of our weird new audio discoveries or creations into the mix

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,620
and then suck them right off for each other's and for use here on the Hour of Slack.

139
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:43,280
Now, that song Anarchy in the UK, that computerized cover version was by someone named Jima or J-I-M-A.

140
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,140
But what's interesting is where it came from.

141
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,980
It's a website called dictionaryoke.org.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Online dictionaries that sing the hits of yesterday.

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:04,540
You can basically program in songs, pick songs, and if it can find the tune, I guess you feed it the lyrics or something.

144
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,160
Yes, that's www.dictionaryoke.org.

145
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,000
Some of the other weird little sounds and burblings that pop up here and there on the show.

146
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:28,040
It came from Johnny Wishbone and I am BJR and Fernando Nende Lemore and from Artemia Salina, all the regulars,

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,600
and Dr. Noumonet, the regulars, so to speak, on all.binary slack.

148
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,420
And now I guess Hour of Slack.

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,660
And of course, friends, we always hear lots of ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland,

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,900
which is on every Thursday night.

151
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,080
And anybody can call.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,440
Call in.

153
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:56,060
It's like about midnight Eastern time at WCSB Cleveland, wcsb.org.

154
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,020
Friends, that's Professor Chaz Smith as the host.

155
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,460
And our caller there that time was Reverend Turin.

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,120
And, of course, Lone Cow Dave.

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,740
Lone Cow Dave is always there, even at Christmas.

158
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,920
And see where I am right now, friends.

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,580
It is still Xmas, or about to be, something like that.

160
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,060
See, I never know exactly when each station is going to play any given particular Hour of Slack show.

161
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,600
I mail them out and I generally assume that they play roughly two weeks after I do them.

162
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,600
And so this show may be playing after Christmas or Christmas Day or sometime around these holidays and so forth.

163
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,600
And that's why it's not all Christmas stuff.

164
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,740
But we have yet nonetheless more to come.

165
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,380
From the great obtuse, from the gabofam,

166
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,440
even weasel teats, and Brother Clay, friends.

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,920
A lot of old and new Xmas Hour of Slack.

168
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,780
Old Hours of Slack and old me young.

169
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,600
So separate, so separate, so separate.

170
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,260
You from Telco.

171
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

173
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,640
Shut up, pink boy.

174
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,100
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

175
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,200
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

176
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, all you got to do is fight Jesus and other action figures sold separately.

177
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,220
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

178
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,400
This toy falls apart in three days.

179
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,240
He-Bob.

180
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,440
As the bastards of the universe, too much is always better than not enough.

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,500
From Bob Dobbs.

182
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I came down so separately.

183
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,660
Gorgeous.

184
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,680
We can blow from head to toe.

185
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,220
Joy.

186
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,520
My God.

187
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Everything you see here, can't also separate me.

188
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,280
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,040
Santa Claus.

190
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah!

191
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,140
Yeah!

192
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,380


193
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:55,740
Yeah!

194
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,060


195
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,180


196
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,180


197
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,240


198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,240


199
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:00,920
Yeah!

200
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,100
Yeah!

201
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:01,940


202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000


203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:02,960
Yeah!

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000


205
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,980
Yeah!

206
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:04,980


207
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,480
Yeah!

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Yeah!

209
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:07,560


210
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,280
Yeah!

211
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,280


212
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,280


213
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah!

214
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,340
Yeah!

215
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah!

216
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:20,980
Ah!

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,380
Yeah!

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,760
insecurity

219
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,160
bakın

220
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,160


221
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,940
conseguir

222
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,700
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted.

223
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
for Christmas.

224
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,100
He wanted an electric train.

225
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,280
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table Jay did prepare.

226
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,820
for it was going to set it up.

227
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,660
So, I paid him a commercial for an electric train.

228
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,160
So, I need a car a regular ride.

229
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,340
So, I need a car a regular ride.

230
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,200
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

231
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,200
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

232
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,000
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

233
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,100
The station and the gateman.

234
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,960
The water tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

235
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,980
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

236
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,060
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

237
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,680
I didn't do it. Can I still have my dog?

238
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:08,960
No!

239
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,340
Boys and girls, everyone wants a Slinky.

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
You ought to get one.

241
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Get a Slinky. Get your Slinky now.

242
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,760
You know what else let me down?

243
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,380
You're sloppy.

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,240
They had those big magnet things.

245
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,000
You're stinky.

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,280
And then they showed on TV somebody pulling a Volkswagen with the magnet that looked red.

247
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,640
It was red and it looked like a Mighty Man thing.

248
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,920
Oh, wow.

249
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,920
And it was a big magnet.

250
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
There was another good one, too.

251
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,040
You had a big red magnetic thing?

252
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,420
It was a finger that would shoot.

253
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,780
There was a lot of spy toys.

254
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,620
There was a lot of spy toys around.

255
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes, exactly.

256
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,020
And there was a finger.

257
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,920
I can almost remember the song.

258
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,280
Double Agent Man.

259
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,800
How did I ever get along with five?

260
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,260
Secret Agency Woman.

261
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,920
Yeah, the fingers you could get.

262
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,780
All different kinds of fingers.

263
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,520
Some of them would shoot little darts, poison darts.

264
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,120
Some of them would...

265
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,900
So there were the mind control, remember the little mind control devices?

266
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,460
Some of them would launch little tiny nuclear headed...

267
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,420
Nuclear headed boys and girls.

268
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,920
See, that was the main problem.

269
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,200
The secret Sam brainwashing kit.

270
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
Sexual devices or something like that.

271
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,320
Those were the best.

272
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,180
Those were the best for me and my mom and at least dad.

273
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,820
I sometimes, when I come home, I was sober enough to walk.

274
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,800
Or is that called marital aids?

275
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,340
Well, that wasn't too obvious.

276
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,560
What, marital aids?

277
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,240
I had a...

278
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,300
No, you don't want to talk about that.

279
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,320
A secret Sam brainwasher kit where one kid would play the red Chinese interrogator.

280
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,900
Yeah, those were great.

281
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,960
And the other guy would play the American prisoner in the Korean War.

282
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,160
Did you ever play double Manchurian on that?

283
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,660
I'm glad to see battleship is still out there.

284
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,720
Actually, I ended up attacking a school teacher.

285
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,420
You did?

286
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,600
Say what?

287
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,340
Like three weeks after playing that because...

288
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,040
The light went off.

289
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,640
...a kid deprogrammed me to.

290
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,120
It was called Six Finger.

291
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,160
That is a beautiful story for Thanksgiving.

292
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,780
Don't!

293
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,380
You're wasting my time!

294
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,840
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

295
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,220
Santa Claus.

296
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Santa Claus.

297
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,700
Santa Claus is real.

298
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,960
Santa Claus is real.

299
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,680
Santa Claus is real.

300
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,000
Santa Claus is real.

301
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,700
Santa Claus is real.

302
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,080
Santa Claus is real.

303
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,080


304
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,820
Santa Claw is a fool child.

305
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,900
Santa Claus.

306
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,120
Santa Claw is a fool child.

307
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,120


308
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,320
Santa Claus is real.

309
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,320


310
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,320


311
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,320


312
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,780
Santa Claus.

313
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,320
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

314
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,320
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

315
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,600
But if you'll notice from time to time, especially on this most joyous birth of our baby dog,

316
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,260
that the things that you're wearing, never mind what I'm wearing, come on, get out of here.

317
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,220
Hey, stop.

318
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,440
Get your hand.

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,620
Hey.

320
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,940
Come on, put your hand.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,260
Well, I had no idea.

322
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
It's no big deal.

323
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,500
I don't, you know.

324
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,120
Joel, right, man.

325
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,720
I understand Ed Wood was into that.

326
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,200
Ed Wood took the beach at Normandy in his frilly pink panties.

327
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,300
And his, you know, and his entrenching tool.

328
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,260
And that's the important part.

329
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,120
I want everybody from Sea Company over here.

330
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,560
The baby Jesus, the Mother Mary, and Bob.

331
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,100
Let's take them.

332
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,140
Christmas Day, June 1944.

333
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,520
We kick some Nazi butt.

334
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,580
The Babylonian hussars entrenched deeply on the beach,

335
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,340
dressed in their crab suits and their funny long underwear.

336
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,460
The cause of consternation isn't having anything to do with their cyclical cults.

337
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,200
It has more particularly to do with their religious doctrine.

338
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,440
And the Christmas Nazi devils fought the Christmas army men.

339
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,760
They stood together.

340
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,540
And God won.

341
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Hand in hand until God won.

342
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,600
And the devil cried his devilish tears.

343
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,220
They were salty.

344
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,420
They were vinegary.

345
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,020
They were very bitter tears.

346
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,120
And as we collected them like tiny raindrops in a toxic pool,

347
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,580
we sat together and shaved.

348
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,980
And thanked our monkey we were born again in the incandescent light.

349
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,480
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan.

350
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,400
On July 4th.

351
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
And now you can have it all.

352
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,300
All pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

353
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,660
The birth of our baby.

354
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,340
The baby Satan as told by various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

355
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Including that announcer.

356
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,580
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

357
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,820
An announcement of the blessed anointment and birthday of our Lord.

358
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,060
See you.

359
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
See you.

360
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:14,900
Pray.

361
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
See you.

362
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:23,540
For one bright Christmas morning.

363
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,420
See you.

364
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:25,780
See you.

365
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:25,900


366
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,060
was born.

367
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,040
a cradle…

368
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,380
the rave Jesus at sorts.

369
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,180
To a rich man's family.

370
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,940
Batons

371
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,080
the river.

372
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,500
yss

373
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,340
Oh, I did that, my friends.

374
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
Well, rather, I pushed that button, I guess you could say.

375
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:32,920
And this music in the background is actually the Bishop from New York.

376
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,700
We've heard other burblings and sounds from Johnny Wishbone and, of course, ESO Swamp Radio.

377
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:52,500
And before that, Obtuse did all that Santa crap and Slinky crap and the beautifully mixed holiday buying crap.

378
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,800
And you can get it.

379
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,460
You can get it.

380
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:54,460


381
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,200
You can get his free album on buying.

382
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,920
But it's free.

383
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,640
Check their website, obtuse.iuma.com.

384
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,280
Yeah, and email them from there or something.

385
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,520
It's obtuse.iuma.com.

386
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,360
Great stuff.

387
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:24,100
But now, friends, now a premiere, a world premiere, truly, of the latest, greatest new hit from...

388
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,300
Gary Gaprogfran of the band that dare not speak its name, and he still dare not...

389
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,900
Putty Butt.

390
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,580
Putty Butt.

391
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,760
Putty Butt.

392
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,320
Putty Butt.

393
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


394
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,720
Putty Butt.

396
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,360
Putty Butt.

397
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,580
Putty Butt.

398
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,740
Putty Butt.

399
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,800
My baby just sits right there

400
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,260
Dressed up in her underwear

401
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Jerry Springer is on the air

402
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,720
She's a putty bug

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,640
My baby ain't got much fat

404
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,400
Overeating's not where she's at

405
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,080
Not moving from where she's sat

406
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,640
She's a putty bug

407
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm sitting like Barry White

408
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,920
Trying to get her to move at night

409
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,940
Guess I'm right

410
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,740
She's a putty bug

411
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,900
My baby ain't going nowhere

412
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,720
Once a week she moves from there

413
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,560
So I can pat you under her chair

414
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,960
She's a putty bug

415
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,600
She's a putty bug

416
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,460
Putty bug

417
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,120
Putty bug

418
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,480
By Gary

419
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,860
Gabofam

420
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,360
Wow, Stimpy.

421
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,160
We sure walked a long way.

422
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm pumped.

423
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,240
Look, Ren.

424
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,160
It's St. Wizzleteat's house.

425
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,020
This must be the West Pole.

426
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,180
Hey, why don't we sing for him?

427
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Yeah.

428
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,740
Then we can get our socks filled with sausages.

429
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,460
Well, hello, Mrs. Wizzleteat's.

430
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,460
Is Stinky home?

431
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,520
Stinky?

432
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,200
There's some filthy little street urchins to see you.

433
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,200
Huh?

434
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,100
Urchins?

435
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
What are urchins?

436
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,500
Some kind of newfangled dog?

437
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,040
Is that what you are?

438
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Some kind of dog?

439
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,380
Well, then, you better bark like a dog.

440
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,500
If you're gonna act like a dog, then you better cry like a dog.

441
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,480
Honey, go get me my dog walloping two by four from the shed.

442
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,420
No, no, no.

443
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,040
We're here to sing you a yaksmas carol, Mr. Deet, sir.

444
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,000
Singing?

445
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,660
Well, that's different.

446
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,880
Honey, go get me my dog walloping guitar.

447
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,200
But let me sing you a song.

448
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,380
A little song I wrote to go somewhere.

449
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,100
Something like this.

450
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh, the big wooden chicken lived in the bush.

451
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,520
A big fat bush full of worms.

452
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,100
Hey, man.

453
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,140
I think it's time to get out of here.

454
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,540
They ate the chicken and they all died the next day.

455
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,080
It is turnover.

456
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,600
The time of the year when all things sell.

457
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,160
The end of the year sale.

458
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,960
Oh, yeah.

459
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,720
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

460
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,100
I know.

461
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,540
Yeah.

462
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,480
Are we?

463
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,060
Is Chris?

464
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,380
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

465
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,380


466
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,940
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

467
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,260
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

468
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:07,900
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

469
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
Oh, yes.

470
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,920
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,200
And it was something else in between there.

472
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:21,560
But before it was after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.

473
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,000
It was something else.

474
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,780
But I think they started the war over it.

475
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah.

476
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,380
Yeah.

477
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,300
If you haven't heard of me, I wouldn't be surprised.

478
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,080
I bet you know my relatives.

479
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,100
Their names will never die.

480
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,640
My mother is a saint and my brother is a God.

481
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,760
But all I am is Jesus Brother Bob.

482
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,280
Jesus Brother Bob.

483
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,620
Jesus Brother Bob.

484
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,800
Nobody relative of the Son of God.

485
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,820
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

486
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
I'd be born in the brother of God, Junior.

487
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,300
Ah!

488
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,280
I have to pay the ferry to cross the Galilee.

489
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,140
But not my brother.

490
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,380
No, not him.

491
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,740
He walks across for free.

492
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,600
I finally get to work about a quarter after nine.

493
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Already he's turning water into wine.

494
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,300
Jesus Brother Bob.

495
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,740
Jesus Brother Bob.

496
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,820
Nobody relative of the Son of God.

497
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,220
If only I'd been born.

498
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,760
Just a little sooner.

499
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,060
I'd be born in the brother of God, Junior.

500
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,640
One day when I was home, I heard a mighty roar.

501
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,700
There were a thousand people right outside the door.

502
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,140
Help us Jesus, help us.

503
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
Came the cheering from the mountains.

504
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,200


505
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,200


506
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,480
There were a thousand people riding a ride.

507
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,480


508
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,480


509
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,480


510
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,420
But-

511
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,760
Then they got a look at me,

512
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,100
I'm not its only Bob.

513
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,440
Jesus Brother Bob.

514
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,000
Jesus Brother Bob.

515
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,180
Nobody relative of the Son of God.

516
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,580
If only I'd been born.

517
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,200
Just a little sooner.

518
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,500
I'd be more than the brother of God, Junior

519
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,920
He, he died up on the cross

520
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,080
I thought that I was free

521
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,120
Finally, people would get to know me

522
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,560
For me

523
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,400
Hi, Bob

524
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,140
Hey, Judas

525
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,480
Hey

526
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,740
This was my big chance

527
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,160
To finally get ahead

528
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,300
The next thing you know, he's rising from the dead

529
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,680
Jesus, Brother Bob

530
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,240
Jesus, Brother Bob

531
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,200
I know, buddy, Brother Jim

532
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm the son of God

533
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,320
If only I'd been born just a little sooner

534
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,460
I'd be more than the brother of God, Junior

535
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,860
Jesus, Brother Bob

536
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,720
Jesus, Brother Bob

537
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,500
Jesus, Brother Bob

538
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I know, buddy, Brother Jim

539
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,620
I'm the son of God

540
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,740
If only I'd been born just a little sooner

541
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,120
I'd be more than the brother of God, Junior

542
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,880
Bob

543
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,440
Bob

544
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,680
Bob

545
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,000
Bob

546
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,580
Bob

547
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,420
Bob

548
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,740
Bob

549
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,340
Bob

550
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,800
Bob

551
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


552
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


553
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


554
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


555
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


556
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


557
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


558
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,700
Now you're back.

559
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,180
You're blaming Jesus.

560
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,360
You're blaming our Lord.

561
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,720
Except I sort of understand, because...

562
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,000
I've understood the way any old fool would understand.

563
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,180
There was no Jesus,

564
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,380
no flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

565
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,560
It's not that you don't want to,

566
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,960
it's that they won't let you.

567
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,860
No, there's just a crime in wilderness.

568
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,620
They're ashamed.

569
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,320
In the hot pursuit of wolves,

570
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,260
everywhere in the background.

571
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,780
I'm ashamed of them.

572
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,040
Oh, it's cold.

573
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm leaving that city life behind.

574
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,300
I can't get my finger off the paper.

575
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,280
I can't get my little knife in the pan, Jan.

576
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,360
Come on, cowboy.

577
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,640
No, man, I was trying to hear it against your tree,

578
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,880
and it started whispering to me, man.

579
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, you've been drinking.

580
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,500
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

581
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,000
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

582
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,040
I swear to God, look at it.

583
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,140
Isn't it?

584
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,420
What?

585
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,060
It's your Christmas witch coming.

586
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,740
It's true.

587
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,540
A Christmas witch.

588
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,060
A Christmas witch.

589
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,140
I'll be whole.

590
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,200
Oh, my God, yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more...

591
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,320
Her breasts are so cold.

592
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,540
Witchy than angelic.

593
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,520
I know she must be a true witch.

594
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,560
I guess you could call her that

595
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,740
if that's what she's packing out of you for real.

596
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,120
She's surrounded by hovering Christmas ornaments.

597
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,300
It looks like a radar device.

598
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:24,820
What?

599
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,000
Yo.

600
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,060
Yo?

601
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,520
It's her.

602
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,380
What up?

603
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,280
Nothing.

604
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,260
What's up?

605
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,100
What a deep voice.

606
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,680
What's up?

607
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,800
First Christmas witch.

608
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

609
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,700
I swear she had a much higher voice before when she called.

610
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,400
But...

611
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,760
Are you the 29-year-old girl I've dreamed of for the last 25 minutes?

612
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,380
Yo.

613
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,600
Are you the 29-year-old woman I've dreamed of for the last 25 minutes?

614
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,880
No, but, um...

615
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,480
Can you...

616
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,360
Hello?

617
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,920
Yes.

618
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,240
I figure that, um, on an occasional guest that,

619
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,700
quite frankly, that people want to listen to.

620
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
That I could quite entertain them.

621
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,520
You?

622
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,760
You could entertain them?

623
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, sure.

624
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,300
Quite frankly.

625
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,240
Uh, what do you mean by quite frankly?

626
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,380
And here's Frank!

627
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,720
I'm a sexy black male.

628
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,920
That's what we got Frank here.

629
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,020
He's a sexy black male.

630
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,820
He says he works in the computer industry.

631
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,720
He's 35 years old.

632
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,100
Oh, no.

633
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,240
Skiing, fishing, and...

634
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,060
That's a complete lie.

635
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,800
Pardon?

636
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,160
But what's behind door number three?

637
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,000
That's right.

638
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,240
It's the monster woman of your dreams.

639
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,420
No, you're not going to be the babe of your life.

640
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,260
Behind door number three.

641
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,040
The queen.

642
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,580
Who is the king?

643
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,580
The money machine, says the queen.

644
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120

715
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,180
A devil doll!

716
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,560
And before that, a Christmas witch on ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland

717
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:16,560
And that song, Jesus' Brother Bob, is by the Arrogant Worms

718
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,500
A band called the Arrogant Worms, posted by Dr. Lake Hume

719
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,700
And friends, now we find ourselves pushing our way into a new century

720
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,880
Oh, wait, we already did that

721
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,080
Well, anyway, we still are pushing our way into a new century

722
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,660
And the changes are not always up to us

723
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,860
But sometimes they are, friends

724
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,160
And we need to think of what we're going to do next

725
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,960
Well, actually, we don't have to worry about it

726
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:55,440
Because July 5th through 7th, 2002, the Exodus will arrive at Brushwood Campground in New York City

727
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,140
And we'll probably meet you there

728
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,840
But if not, we sort of need to make plans

729
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:06,020
And I don't know, my friends, exactly what we need to do

730
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:14,580
Maybe, maybe we need to do a winter revival to get kind of pumped up for, uh, for, uh, Quad X Day

731
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,240
To get ready for Santa's Big Red Sack!

732
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,500
Santa's coming with his big red sack!

733
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,740
Singing and dancing to their pagan deities

734
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,760
You got Santa's big red sack!

735
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
Sun rising in the distance

736
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,880
Well, uh, thank you so much!

737
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,920
I'll be in love!

738
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,000
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

739
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,060
Music

740
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,040
Way up north where the cold wind blows

741
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,160
There's a little old man that you all know

742
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,420
He's been busting his nuts the whole damn year

743
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,480
Stampin' on tools, ridin' his deer

744
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,300
Come prance up, oh, blitzin'

745
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,580
Oh, what a great book!

746
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,820
It's that time of year, guess I've got all the luck

747
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,040
And you, Mrs. Claus, are you ready at last?

748
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,560
Our North Pole is ready

749
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,020
I'm pumped up with gas

750
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,040
Christmas time is my time of year

751
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,140
It's your sweet boy's cooking, let's get into gear

752
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,220
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll

753
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,380
You'll love them women from their heads to their toes

754
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,960
Time to pack up the sled!

755
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,340
Make that be a trick!

756
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,520
No time to complain, don't you give me no less

757
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,180
There's a countin' on me!

758
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,740
It's Christmas time!

759
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,740
Deliver my loan if I don't, it's a crime!

760
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,120
Through the cold north sky I fly in my sled

761
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,280
Don't need no radar, I'm usin' my head

762
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,560
To direct my nose to your good fun

763
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,640
I tickle your fancy till the morning comes

764
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,340
I'm ready to go

765
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,740
Christmas time is my time of year

766
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,920
It's your sweet boy's cooking, let's get into gear

767
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,980
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll

768
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,160
You'll love them women from their heads to their toes

769
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,240
Well, I come down to you just once a year

770
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,480
With my big red sack and belly full of beer

771
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm gonna bring all the women lots of Christmas cheer

772
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,460
Load it in, ready, Saint Nicholas is here!

773
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,640
This is the story of old Saint Nick

774
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,820
With his big red sack and his candy stick

775
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,000
Flying back home with his beer so ice

776
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,140
He's lickin' that prune tang all Christmas night

777
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,180
Christmas time is my time of year

778
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,280
It's your sweet boy's cooking, let's get into gear

779
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,360
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll

780
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,560
You'll love them women from their heads to their toes

781
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,380
Christmas time is my time of year

782
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,900
It's your sweet boy's cooking, let's get into gear

783
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,820
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll

784
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,980
You'll love them women from their heads to their toes

785
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,700
holiday Christmasさん

786
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,480
Christmasさん

787
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:25,360
And Jesus also sequenced,

788
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,700
said there would be the birth pang of strange phenomena in the atmosphere. I believe that the

789
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:39,060
unidentified flying objects are part of what Jesus could have meant by these strange signs

790
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,340
in the atmosphere. But we will really see some pyrotechnics when the Jupiter effect takes place.

791
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,120
Well, we're live here at the plasma drift, and it looks like Santa Claus is never going to make it.

792
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,040
He's going to not make it. He's going to create it out of the back of his mind. Santa Claus has been

793
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,240
cloned, and he's in this small PC jar here. As you notice, the fluid is checked perfectly clean

794
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,340
and clear, and also at a temperature of 79 degrees. We're going to have to go up or down,

795
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,620
as so many of us do after the holidays. Some of us just want to take a long drive in the

796
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,880
opposite lane of the freeway. Merry Christmas, you bastard, you're mine.

797
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,140
Merry Christmas, you bastard, you're mine.

798
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,000
Quit your job. Slack off. Quit your job. Slack off. Quit your job. Slack off.

799
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:48,720
We're going to have to go up or down, as so many of us do after the holidays.

800
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:22,100
We're going to have to go up or down, as so many of us do after the holidays.

801
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,540
Attack!

802
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:22,920
Attack!

803
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,140
Attack!

804
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,640
Attack!

805
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,120
Attack!

806
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,140
Attack!

807
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,160
Attack!

808
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,320
Attack!

809
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,320


810
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,680
Well friends, we've got, um,

811
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,200
our own special Christmas carol

812
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,800
that we're gonna play that's, that we're

813
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,640
inventing as we go right now.

814
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:33,980
X-mas.

815
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,140
Snap!

816
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,260
Sound system!

817
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,640
Ho ho ho!

818
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,020
Ho ho ho!

819
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,520
Ho ho ho!

820
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,620
Come one, come all!

821
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,140
It's He-Bomb! Hey kids, you can help the mighty Satina's rights

822
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,800
overthrow the evil normals

823
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,500
with new Bob-Dobs, actually bigger with

824
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,540
Rock and Pie. What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dob.

825
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from

826
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,600
you know who? I'm a chocolate

827
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,760
space cadet. Life support system

828
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,900
down to zero cocoa.

829
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,640
Feeling space-free? Have some of my new

830
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,440
cocoa pebbles, now so

831
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,160
thrombody!

832
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,540
Smells coconut-ish.

833
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,240
Nice cocoa

834
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,000
lickable.

835
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,680
Whoa!

836
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Well friends, what do you, what do you think?

837
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,540
Is, is it the nativity of Santa

838
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,960
Claus that we're trying to

839
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,000
celebrate here, or is it

840
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,720
the horrible death of

841
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,500
the Santa Bob, the Santai

842
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,600
Bob, as he's been referred

843
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,500
to in some early pre-scriptures?

844
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
It's so separate, it's so separate.

845
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,420
professionally.

846
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,340

Yeah, here I is again, that's me, and there's you

853
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,260
And I dig all you cats out there whippin' and wailin'

854
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,160
And jumpin' up and down and suckin' up that fine juice

855
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,600
And pattin' each other on the back and tellin' each other

856
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,820
Who the greatest cat in the world is

857
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,080
Mr. Malenkov, Mr. Dallenkov, Mr. Eisenhorn

858
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,640
Woosin' Weasin', Meissenwooser, and Mr. Woodhiller

859
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,800
Mr. Beechiller, Mr. Churchill, and all them hills

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,000
They gonna get it straight

861
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,640
If they can't straighten it, they know a cat that knows a cat

862
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,700
That's gonna get it straight

863
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,580
Well, I'm gonna put a cat on you

864
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,520
Was the sweetest, gonest, wailin'est cat

865
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,020
That ever stomped on the sweet-swingin' sphere

866
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
And they called this your cat

867
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,720
The Nair

868
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,060
The Nair

869
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,740
The Nair

870
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,680
That was the cat's name

871
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,400
He was a carp in the kitty

872
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,920
Now the Nair was the kind of a cat that come on so wild

873
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,380
And so sweet

874
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,940
And so strong

875
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,500
And so witted

876
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,540
That when he laid it

877
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,480
Wham, it stayed there

878
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,940
Now see all the rest of the cat look to see what he puttin' down

879
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,500
He said, man, look at that cat blow

880
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,460
Let the cat go, man, look at it

881
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,380
Get out the way, let the cat go

882
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,020
Man, don't bug me, get off my back

883
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,600
I'm tryin' to dig what the cat's sayin'

884
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,620
They pushin' the Nair

885
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,060
Cause the one that's got the Nair

886
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,140
Want to dig his lick, you see

887
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,200
Dig his miracle lick

888
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,980
So the Nair say

889
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,840
Wait a minute, babies

890
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,440
Tell you what I'm gonna do

891
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,960
I ain't gonna take two, four, six, eight of you cats

892
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,360
But I'm gonna take twelve of you studs

893
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,760
And straighten you all at the same time

894
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,960
Heh, heh

895
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,040
Heh, heh, heh

896
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,340
Look like you pretty boys

897
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,860
You buddy with me

898
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,960
So the Nair and his buddies was goofin' off down the boulevard one day

899
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,380
And they run into a little cat

900
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,160
With a bent frame

901
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,220
So the Nair's

902
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,860
Look at this little cat with a bent frame

903
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,400
And he say

904
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,360
What's the matter with you, baby?

905
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,820
And the little cat with the bent frame

906
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,860
He say, well, my frame is bent, Nair

907
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,280
It's been bent for me in front

908
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,020
So the Nair's

909
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,200
Look at the little cat with the bent frame

910
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,820
And he put the golden eyes of love on this here little kitty

911
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,180
And he look right down into the windows of his soul

912
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,620
And he say to the little cat

913
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,980
He say, straighten it

914
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,600
Boop, boop

915
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,040
The cat went up straight in a Nair

916
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,400
And everybody jumping up and down say

917
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,000
Look what the Nair's put on that boy

918
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,920
You dug him before

919
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,040
Dig him now

920
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,280
Yes, I can feel it

921
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,780
Now you see the Nair's a-comin' on so strong

922
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,820
And so fine and so great

923
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,440
Talkin' about when's he gonna appear next

924
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,400
What did he do there?

925
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,080
He put it down once for the cat

926
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,760
The cat dug it, didn't dig it

927
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,240
Put it down twice, dug it, didn't dig it

928
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,680
Put it down the third time, the cat dug it

929
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
Wham! Walked away with his eyes buggin' out

930
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,660
Head in the air, bumpin' in there, everybody

931
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,960
Nair's a-comin' on so fine and so strong

932
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,440
They put it on his coattail

933
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,800
They want him to sign the autograph

934
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,760
They want him to do this gig here

935
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,540
They want him to do that gig there

936
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,660
They want him to make it to the radio to video

937
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,860
And they're all that jazz

938
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,040
He can't make all that jazz

939
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,040
Like a splendid cat of carbon

940
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,220
The kitty's got his own nick

941
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,220
But when he know he should show

942
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,380
To blow and cannot go

943
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,260
Because he got some strain on him

944
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,520
He sends a couple of these cats

945
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,600
That he's straightenin'

946
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,560
So came a little old 50-cent gig one day

947
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,100
And the Nair's couldn't make it

948
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,760
So he put it on two of these cats

949
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,040
He said, boys, go straighten that little riff over there

950
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,020
Boys, he said, take it off the ground and put it on the floor

951
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,020


952
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,020


953
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,680
off your mind, Naz. We got it covered.

954
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,300
So on the way over, the boys

955
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,140
run into a little old

956
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,620
20-cent pool of water,

957
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,000
and it gets right in the

958
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,140
middle of the boat, and all of a

959
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,280
sudden, laugh!

960
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,820
The thunder stormed, lightning flashing,

961
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,620
and the thunder roared,

962
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,840
and the boat rolled up and down, and the poor

963
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,100
cats figured every minute gonna be the last,

964
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,820
and one cat looked up,

965
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,320
and

966
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,760
here come the

967
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,340
Naz.

968
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,000
Cool

969
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,260
as anyone you ever

970
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,220
see. Right

971
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,920
across the water,

972
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,640
walking,

973
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,260
and Naz is a little

974
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,280
boy on board. I think his name was Jude on

975
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,220
board the boat. He said, Hey, Naz,

976
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,760
can I make it out there with you?

977
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,200
Naz said, Make it,

978
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Jude. And old Jude went

979
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,960
stomping off that boat, took about

980
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,000
four steps, dropped his whole cart,

981
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,240
and Naz had to stash him

982
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,380
back on board again.

983
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,880
So the Naz

984
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,100
looked at these kiddies, and he said,

985
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,600
What's the matter to you babies now?

986
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,900
He said, What's going on here, boys? He said, What's taking place?

987
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,100
He said, What's all

988
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,680
this fuss about here? What's going on?

989
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,140
He said, Man, what's going on? He said, Can't you see

990
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,780
the storm storming, and the lightning

991
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,220
flashing, and the thunder roared?

992
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,040
And the Naz said,

993
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,140
I told you

994
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,000
to stay cool,

995
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,560
didn't I, babies?

996
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,120
Now the fame

997
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,740
of the Naz is jumping!

998
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,800
The grapevine is shooting

999
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,040
out sparks 40 feet long, and they're

1000
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,060
talking about what he said, and how he stood up

1001
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,020
to all these big bad cats, and

1002
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,460
dug all that bad jazz,

1003
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,600
and put them all down.

1004
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,900
And what he said he's going to do, and where he's going to be,

1005
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,880
and how he's going to be it, till the grapevine is jumping

1006
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,360
so bad, there is now

1007
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,380
16,000

1008
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,860
of these studs and kiddies

1009
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,780
in the Naz's

1010
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,720
little hometown where the cat lived,

1011
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:19,860
looking

1012
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,820
to get straight.

1013
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,060
Well, the Naz

1014
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,100
know he can't straighten them all. There's two smaller

1015
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,820
places to want to hang everybody up.

1016
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,440
Nobody can make it.

1017
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,580
So the Naz look out at these 16,000

1018
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,640
studs and kiddies,

1019
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,640
and they say to them,

1020
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,100
Come on,

1021
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,480
babies.

1022
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,840
Just get on out down

1023
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,480
the road.

1024
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,900
And there went the Naz, swinging

1025
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,640
away ahead of all these studs and kiddies and 16,000,

1026
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,700
stomping up a big,

1027
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,000
big swinging beat behind them.

1028
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,100
And their great necklace of love

1029
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,820
is supercharging

1030
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,660
and charging to them.

1031
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,220
Oh, it's brothers and brothers and sister to sister.

1032
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,260
And the Naz is stomping

1033
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,640
on a sweet swinging beat,

1034
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,840
going down the road. Naz talking about

1035
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,160
how pretty the flowers, how pretty the hours, how pretty me,

1036
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,960
how pretty you, how pretty he,

1037
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,660
how pretty she. Naz

1038
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,180
had them pretty eyes.

1039
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,040
He wanted everybody to see through his eyes so they could

1040
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,720
see how pretty it was. And the

1041
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,420
havers are too wailing gorgeous.

1042
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,020
And the mother got time that before

1043
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,760
you know it, it was

1044
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,900
scarf in time. And these poor cats is

1045
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,860
42 mile out of town. Ain't nobody

1046
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,120
got the first biscuit.

1047
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,920
Well, the Naz

1048
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,520
look at these cats

1049
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,760
and they say they're kicking

1050
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,600
the sand out there. The Naz say,

1051
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,500
You hungry?

1052
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,840
Ain't you, babies?

1053
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,820
They say, yeah,

1054
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,820
Naz. We digging you

1055
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,660
so hard what you putting down that

1056
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,900
we didn't

1057
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,140
be fair, Naz. We goofed.

1058
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,420
Yes, that's what you call it.

1059
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,260
So the Naz say,

1060
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,400
Well,

1061
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,320
we gots to take it easier.

1062
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,860
We wouldn't

1063
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,880
want to go ahead and order up something you might

1064
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,800
not like, would

1065
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,120
we?

1066
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,640
And they say, No, Naz.

1067
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,920
You put it down

1068
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,700
and we'll pick it up.

1069
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,300
So the Naz step back a few

1070
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,080
paces and he say,

1071
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,500
Oh, great

1072
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,160
swinging

1073
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,800
flowers

1074
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,940
of the fields.

1075
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,020
And they said, Oh, great

1076
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,460
nonstop signal of sound and beauty.

1077
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,300
And the Naz

1078
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,400
say, Stamp

1079
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,880
upon the terror.

1080
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,240
And they hit it.

1081
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,780
And the Naz say,

1082
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,760
Straighten your miracle of body.

1083
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,300
The body went up.

1084
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,120
And he says, Straighten your arms.

1085
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,380
The arms went up. And he said, Higher.

1086
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,700
And the arms went higher.

1087
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,300
And the Naz say,

1088
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Dig in

1089
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,720
further.

1090
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,460
And they dug it.

1091
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,980
And when they did,

1092
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,300
Wham!

1093
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,980
The thunder went to.

1094
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,040
And they look in their left hand.

1095
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,400
It's a great big sweet

1096
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,760
stuffed

1097
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,280
smoked

1098
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:20,960
fish.

1099
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,200
And in the other,

1100
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,440
a big thick loaf

1101
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,100
of that gone

1102
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,620
crazy honey tasting

1103
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,420
nonstop sweet

1104
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,780
swinging southern

1105
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,540
red.

1106
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,180
Why, these

1107
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,500
polecats flipped.

1108
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,380
Naz never did nothing simple.

1109
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,120
When he laid it,

1110
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,340
he laid it.

1111
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,140
Say, when the saints

1112
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,460
marching in,

1113
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,740
when the saints

1114
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,080
go marching in,

1115
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,980
Hallelujah!

1116
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,500
All wants to be

1117
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,860
in that number,

1118
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:03,540
the saints go marching in.

1119
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,820
Say, when the saints

1120
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,220
marching in,

1121
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,420
go marching in,

1122
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,740
when the saints go marching over me,

1123
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,820
Hallelujah!

1124
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,220
All wants to be

1125
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,860
in that number,

1126
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,460
the saints go marching,

1127
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,460
and rob all the judges of

1128
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,400
ruin.

1129
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,460
Oh, holy night,

1130
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,420
the stars are brightly shining.

1131
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,700
It is the night of our

1132
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,300
gisting and birth.

1133
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,600
Long lay, long lay the world

1134
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,300
in terror and the fighting.

1135
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,940
The pit and the stone

1136
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,180
found its rest.

1137
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,540
A thrill of hope,

1138
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,440
the wheel of hope,

1139
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,940
the weary world rejoices.

1140
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,820
Beyond the grace,

1141
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,180
a new and glorious morn.

1142
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,080
Fall on your knees.

1143
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,300
Oh, hear the angel voices.

1144
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,320
Oh, night,

1145
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,820
Oh, night,

1146
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,100
Oh, night,

1147
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,540
when Christ was born.

1148
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,460
Oh, night,

1149
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,460
Oh, night,

1150
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,140
Oh, night,

1151
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,840
when Christ was born.

1152
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,540
Yes, yes, yes,

1153
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,000
Lord Buckley.

1154
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,220
The great,

1155
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,600
the old New Orleans beatnik.

1156
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,720
Lord Buckley with that amazing rant

1157
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,700
on the naz

1158
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,820
and the fishes and loaves.

1159
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,280
Oh, and friends that bobbled up

1160
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,360
jingle bells that we heard much earlier

1161
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,840
was from our own Rev. Uconn Jack.

1162
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,280
Praise Uconn Jack,

1163
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,020
Back and praise WICA, which plays this show.

1164
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:59,160
And praise all the stations that plays this horrible show.

1165
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,700
And we love you.

1166
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:10,600
And, I mean, seriously, we appreciate every listener out there,

1167
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,940
no matter how much they might hate this show.

1168
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,200
And we actually love the holidays, too,

1169
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,500
because despite all that Santa crap, there's still a lot of slack.

1170
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,040
We'll see you next time.

1171
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:28,040
At P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1172
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:34,360
Or visit the SoGenius website at SoGenius.com.

1173
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,560
Thank you for listening.

1174
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,520
And praise Bob.

1175
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,180
It's all Christmassy right now.

1176
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,120
There's a bright green bob in the window.

1177
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,100
And Christmassy lights.

1178
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,460
Is there a DJA? Is a DJA out there?

1179
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,160
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1180
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,360
No, that's something just left for a DJA.

1181
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,380
It's all Christmassy.

1182
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:04,820
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present.

1183
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,340
Under the tree.

1184
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,320
Smell that cinnamon.

1185
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,620
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1186
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:09,940
And those sugar plums.

1187
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,240
Something's up the chimney hole in sight news, isn't it?

1188
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,960
Yeah.

1189
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,340
Of Santa, I mean.

1190
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,900
Otherwise.

1191
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,040
Gosh.

1192
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,880
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1193
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,540
Oh, beloved Santa.

1194
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,940
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

1195
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,360
Besides, it's so ready to let him be.

1196
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,980
What?

1197
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,700
Praise Bob and Merry Xmas!

1198
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,680
The preceding brought to you by your station in observance of the 450th anniversary of the Reformation.

1199
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,280
Get.

1200
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,280
Piff.

1201
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,360
Destroy.

1202
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,200


1203
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
Long call, Dave.

1204
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,920
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1205
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,500
Yes.
