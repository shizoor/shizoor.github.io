1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
The show ends, the show begins, and so begins another cycle of shows.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,820
We want you to never forget these awful shows.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,000
The terrible wasted lives that you've spent.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,680
The collective years of listening to this rotten show.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,820
And you don't even get it.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
On a friendly basis.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,340
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,240
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,140
The Soap Genius Hour of Sweat.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,500
Ah, yes, dear friends.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,980
This is Hour of Sweat.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,180
Slack number 1,653.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,000
But it's also number 450.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,560
A rerun from July of the so-called 1994.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,740
When the show was only nine years old and still being produced in Dallas.

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,100
This old episode was requested, and we don't get many requests.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,660
The show's changed a lot from decade to decade.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
I don't work nearly as hard editing it as I used to.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,580
Because it takes...

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Too much time away from other things I need to be doing.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,840
Especially near the holidays.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,500
Like filling Slack Friday.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,740
Two-for-one Salvation Orders.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,180
And making books and videos and walking the dog and so forth.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,540
So I don't blame people for liking old shows.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,060
They had a lot more variety.

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,160
This one is from when I was producing the shows from my home studio in Dallas.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,760
We were between radio stations.

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,580
So we relied more on clips from other subgeniusly...

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,560
Subgeniusly...

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,580
Radio shows like Puzzling Evidence in San Francisco on KPFA.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,180
And ESO Swamp Radio Brain Rot Theater in Cleveland on WCSB.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,020
And also on cassette tapes that were mailed in.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,300
It was the days before the internet.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,260
And people spent more time on things like making tapes and mailing them around.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,140
People also read and wrote books in those days.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,280
And this episode reflects all that.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
We have Puzzling Evidence.

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,960
Doctors for Bob.

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,940
Inventing the Church.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,620
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's rantster piece.

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,800
The Corruptigating Worms rant.

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,960
I read from Donna Cossey's book, Kooks, regarding the Nation of Islam.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,140
And we hear strange music from Slouch.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,620
The Merkins.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,620
The Baby Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
And...

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,300
What...

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
Well...

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,280
Swingin' Love Corpses.

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,500
We'll do this in the background right now.

52
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,080
And now...

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,860
Captain Beefheart.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,140
The path is the mask of love.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,300
A way, a way.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,980
The flow is the task above today.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,840
There is no other way.

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,320
There's no other way.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,320


60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
You've got to trust us.

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,140
When you need a friend.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,880
To find us.

63
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,480
You've got to look within.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,240
You've got to trust us.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,000
You've got to trust us.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Before you turn to dust.

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,940
Before you turn to dust.

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Gotta see it, boy, you see

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Gotta be it, boy, you be

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,980
Gotta see it, boy, you see

71
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,800
You gotta hear without fear

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,420
You gotta feel to reveal

73
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,360
You gotta touch without take

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,800
Such is it that I ain't his ape

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,560
Such is it that I ain't his ape

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Yes, dear friends, Captain Beefheart there

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
and some sort of basement tapes

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,060
the listeners sent us

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,760
a fantastical thing there

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,060
and welcome to another

81
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,640
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,880
Where are we at here?

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,720
I hate having to turn the air conditioner off

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,220
in order to do this show

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,840
but the microphone

86
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,240
you see is a special kind

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,380
that will, uh

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,780
it'll hurt us, friends

89
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,380
It picks up any noise

90
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,920
noises that the human ear cannot hear

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,800
voices of the dead and so forth

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,180
and you can imagine that

93
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,540
the atomic-powered air conditioner

94
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,780
here at the Subgenius Foundation

95
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,600
headquarters studio

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,440
110 degree Texas weather

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh, but, uh

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,860
we will continue

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,680
um, here with, uh

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,500
the, uh

101
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,840
combustible Edison

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,220
here in the background

103
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
from their CD-i swinger

104
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,820
uh, we're continuing with our

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
uh, series

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,680
Hour of Slack series

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,420
on, uh, kooks

108
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,780
and tards

109
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,460
and, uh

110
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,280
news of the weird

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,140
and so forth

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,680
and let's see what sort of news we do have here

113
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,440
this is from, uh

114
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
our friend Chuck Shepherd's view from the ledge

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,760
we'll give the address at the end of the broadcast

116
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,540
Man punished for teaching women

117
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,940
Dhaka, Bangladesh

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,620
Fundamentalist Islamic clerics beat a man with shoes

119
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
and ordered his head shaved

120
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,580
because he ignored their orders

121
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,160
to stop educating illiterate women

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,540
uh-huh

123
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,880
Bismarck Mountains, Papua New Guinea

124
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,460
Dr. Ulrich Ritterfeldt of Holland's Utrecht

125
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,840
University has found a remote jungle tribe

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,760
who worship a photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson

127
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,980
frolicking with his beagles

128
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,540
as their god

129
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,880
the tribe sacrifice yam-like vegetables

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,100
to the photograph of LBJ and his silly dogs

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,880
which is assumed to have been traded to the tribe

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
by an American visitor

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
and on 200 Nolan Street

134
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,380
a man walking by some vagrants

135
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,460
was asked to share his bottle of liquor

136
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,100
and when he refused

137
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,620
one transient became so upset

138
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,260
he stabbed himself

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,020
uh, well, let's, uh

140
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,280
what, what, what, what else have we here?

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,880
we were given this book called Global Ritualism

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,220
Myth and Magic Around the World

143
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,380
and it mentions the Church of the Subgenius

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,040
in the most strange, uh, context

145
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,760
let's see here

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
The Last Faith

147
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,500
they're talking about

148
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,300
uh, uh, creating one's own new rituals from scratch

149
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,640
uh, in order to ach-achieve effective dream connections with the divine

150
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,760
this is some sort of, uh, a book about

151
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
well, it's a serious book

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,260
Myth and Magic

153
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,460
a ritual linking the conscious and the unconscious

154
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,260
archetypes of life, blah blah blah blah blah

155
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,520
The Last Faith, Neo-Creation

156
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,720
uh, wait, let's get some proper music going here

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,540
uh, there's some time

158
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Tommy Lopez

159
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,680
uh, okay, the, the last faith

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,860
Neo-Creation is one that very few seem to have reached

161
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,400
it consists of the wholesale creation of an entire mythos and magical system

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,320
that has no connection with past traditions at all

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,040
this is a virtually impossible undertaking

164
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,560
since most of the forms, practices, and spiritual disciplines

165
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,840
one ostensibly needs to forge these archetypal or spiritual links

166
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,320
that can make this possible

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,620
are in and of themselves part of the system

168
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,760
and part of established traditions

169
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,120
of the three examples that come to mind

170
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,660
the first two were made by people who are both artists

171
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,220
and who created their system simply as art for art's sake

172
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,740
and, uh, then he talks very briefly about

173
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,960
Austen Spare

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,020
who I know very little about

175
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,140
and the magical world of Lord Dunsany

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
the last example, the tr-

177
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,340
not art for art's sake

178
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,500
he doesn't say what it's for

179
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,820
Bob for Bob's sake, friend

180
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,960
the last example

181
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,260
the church of the subgenius

182
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,060
defies all labels and previously stated rules

183
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,440
what's important is that even though it advertises itself as an inherently bogus religion

184
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,700
it is indeed a parody that actually provides myths, rituals, magical techniques

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,380
and an attractive group dynamic

186
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,380
that has made it wildly popular

187
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,340
such semi-serious concepts as

188
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,700
the temporary personal savior

189
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,380
devolution

190
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,220
and slack

191
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,420
are extremely powerful

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,620
though nodding to such traditional systems as Daoism and Dada

193
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,600
well, well, well

194
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,460
so we, we, at least we did give the nod to those old stodgy, uh, traditional, uh, systems

195
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,460
Daoism and Dada

196
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,000
and, uh, I notice they credit us with de-evolution

197
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,400
no, that's the work of Satan

198
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,160
uh, we, we, uh, oh no, that's right, it's evolution that's the work of Satan

199
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,760
I got it, so, de-evolution is the work of Devo

200
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:32,080
and, um, uh, yeah, it's, uh, interesting, uh, uh, they, they think we created a ritual system

201
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,380
this Denny Sargent is the author of this book

202
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,380
cre- yeah, created it

203
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,940
I'll tell you what, man

204
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,120
uh, J.R. Bob Dobbs!

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,140
He didn't have to create nothing

206
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,420
this stuff was told to him direct by Jehovah One

207
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,540
the alien space god from some sin galaxy

208
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,320
the, the, the rival cults like to call that, uh, that thing

209
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,800
that writhing, uh, tachyonic monster

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,080
uh, the Lord God, Jehovah Creator of the Universe

211
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,140
mm-hmm, well, uh, uh

212
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,120
it is a monster that, uh, demands ob- ob- bi-ascent

213
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,340
uh, but, uh, uh, that, there's no sense in, you know, getting these things mixed up

214
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,620
I mean you, you, you don't need to be praying to either one of them

215
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,540
you, but you're supposed to be paying

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,360
and, uh, of course you can do that, uh, through the creation of your own religion

217
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,220
uh, after you have first paid Bob

218
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,360
uh, thank you

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,320
Thank you.

220
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Thank you.

221
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Thank you.

222
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,600
Thank you.

223
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,320
Thank you.

224
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,500
Thank you.

225
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,860
Thank you.

226
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,680
Thank you.

227
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,740
Thank you.

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

229
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,300
Thank you.

230
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,180
Thank you.

231
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,360
If they're true Americans, it's not too late.

232
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,680
It's not too late.

233
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,200
But the end is near the corruptigating snakes of hell.

234
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,080
These little demonic worms.

235
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,760
They're not real snakes.

236
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,980
They're worms.

237
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,260
Are the byproduct of the gelatinous goo that we produce when we think incorrect thinklings.

238
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,220
And there's all kinds of incorrect thinklings and bastardized thoughts going around there.

239
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,180
Creationism.

240
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,500
Anticreationism.

241
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,580
And Darwinism.

242
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
There's no such thing.

243
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,420
We were all created last second.

244
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,200
The moment you ascertain your own consciousness and are aware of it.

245
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,880
That's when those little corruptigating snakes can have their little corruptigating snake influences on you.

246
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,300
And that's why there's so many mass murders and John Wayne Gacy's.

247
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,100
And people pulling their eyes out and their testicular organs.

248
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,160
And running around without any clothes on and their medications off.

249
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,480
That's why it's happening.

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,700
Because society is so deeply decayed from inside.

251
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,280
That it's actually rotting outwards into a plethora of stinkiness.

252
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,920
You said it.

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
Er, I said it.

254
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,880
I said it better than you could imagine me saying it.

255
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Because I know I'm telling the truth.

256
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,460
What must we do as true Americans?

257
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,620
We must not write our congressmen.

258
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,460
Because they're the purveyors of the little tiny corruptigating snakes.

259
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,480
Because they're the purveyors of the little tiny corruptigating snakes.

260
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,060
Because they're the purveyors of the little tiny corruptigating snakes.

261
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,760
Look at the next time you get some mail from the government.

262
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:39,440
And it says Senator Rickenbrack or Vice Vasectomy Honorable Lunchcake and Senor Landfill and all the rest of those guys.

263
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
They're not real.

264
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,220
They're little false dummy heads.

265
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,240
Plastic.

266
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,900
Plastic.

267
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,880
Some of them are this real rare chromium oxide.

268
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,520
Which is a form of rust.

269
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,840
And once they get in office they think they're running the place.

270
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,200
But they're actually the corruptigating snakes from another person's spinal column lumbar.

271
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,100
Yeah.

272
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,560
Yeah.

273
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,480
You thought you left when your science teacher told you that we were in a filling in one of God's teeth.

274
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,800
That wasn't meant to tell you how small or big we are.

275
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,480
Or how insignificant we are.

276
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,100
Everybody knows we're insignificant.

277
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,220
Just try getting bored and croaking a couple times.

278
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,820
It just keeps happening over and over again.

279
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,240
There's no getting off the wheel of karma.

280
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,700
This life is nothing but a bunch of dharma.

281
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,380
If you want to kill the corruptigating snakes you have to kill them yourself.

282
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,620
You must form small mobile units.

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,680
And small mobile phoenix and hunix.

284
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,360
And you must get yourselves cool looking outdoor ponchos and stuff.

285
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,440
And guns.

286
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,780
And train with pikes.

287
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,820
Go up in the hills and hope the British won't catch you.

288
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,900
Because it's too late farmers.

289
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,320
And freedmations.

290
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,160
Not the freedmations.

291
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,120
Take them guys out of there.

292
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,240
I forgot what the name was.

293
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,920
You.

294
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm pointing my finger.

295
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm giving you the finger directly at you buddy.

296
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,460
You.

297
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,140
You.

298
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,420
You.

299
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,380
Number two.

300
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,680
Third man from the rear.

301
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,480
Number two.

302
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,820
Don't point your finger at me daddy or I'll cut off your finger at me.

303
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,260
You.

304
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,620
You.

305
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,200
You.

306
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,540
I'm telling each and every one of you to take what amount of poisons and lusty juices you have

307
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,960
sacked up and drawn up in your nipples and the membranes around your body.

308
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,840
And turn them into a fighting force for the future of your small little stupid looking

309
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,340
little children which have not, will not be born.

310
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Not since they changed the water.

311
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,340
I'm, I'm, I'm ripping them off because everybody needs it including yours truly.

312
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,020
Right Chaz?

313
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,040
Now once you form these small little tiny little small little units you must go out

314
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,400
and train in the forest and pretend that like say huge kangaroos with sunglasses or something

315
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,820
so absurd you can hardly imagine is attacking you.

316
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,800
And then you'll be ready for stealth and secret and surprise because surprise is surprise.

317
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,560
Who would expect a huge carnivorous kangaroo with purple sunglasses to come, come bounding

318
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,320
out of the woods with an AK-47 or some new new assault weapon made in Romania.

319
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,660
No man.

320
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:16,940
No.

321
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,160
That's because they're not made in Romania anymore.

322
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,660
They're made in the UXA, the former UXA which was bequeathed to the sub-illuminati of third

323
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,100
branch from the rear.

324
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,760
And that's not yours truly or yours.

325
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,720
The blue lunge.

326
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,480
The blue lunge.

327
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,940
The blue lunge.

328
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,600
The blue lunged, blue blooded, blue bellied, blue lunge.

329
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,660
The red coats and the blue bloods.

330
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,540
It's all one sniveling, sniferoos, de-driveling swando-

331
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:50,940
Landowners.

332
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,260
Landfillers.

333
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,240
Hoppin' geeks full of themselves trying to take over your own sweat.

334
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,800
What they want to do with something so stinky and wet?

335
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,980
They want to take your limbs.

336
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,340
That's why they start wars.

337
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,120
They start wars for the limb banks.

338
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,200
And we're not talking about flesh.

339
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,300
Landscaping.

340
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,840
That's why they have landscaping so that people will cut off their feet with mechanized potato

341
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,440
rooters.

342
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,280
They want the limbs.

343
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,780
I don't think you got the edge here quite right on the driveway there, young man.

344
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,260
See, you can see it in all their fingers.

345
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,820
They're- they glow green.

346
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,560
Aye.

347
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,980
My name is Flowers.

348
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,740
I'm much prettier than mine.

349
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,940
The chlorophyll's starting to ooze out of the back of your-

350
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,740
Did you just tell me she's Flowers, boy?

351
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,060
Talk about day of the triffids.

352
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
This is ten times worse.

353
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,960
This is an invasion of a bunch of supplicating, corruptigating worms, which actually make

354
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,780
your body, your blood, crystallized and stinky when they cut you open.

355
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,180
When will you wake up?

356
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,480
When will you wake up, America?

357
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,120
When it's too late?

358
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Like fishing in the warm waters of the electric trough.

359
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,700
It's been said that thousands of these turtles will never get old.

360
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,400
A turtle is one of mankind's oldest non-humans.

361
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,460
It goes for lots and lots of times.

362
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,080
It goes as many times as it can.

363
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,160
But it never relieves itself of that original feeling of being a human.

364
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,240
It's a natural feeling, which is to go onward and onward with that hard, tacky little shell

365
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,940
and that stupid nozzle.

366
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,220
But who wants to kill them now?

367
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,020
A big fat nuclear power plant, which is really home to the what?

368
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,320
The corruptigating worms.

369
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,400
The little, teeny, tiny, snakey things in your spinal membrana.

370
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,720
They're alien.

371
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,780
They're as alien as blinis and vodka.

372
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,620
They're as alien as pasta for Zuul.

373
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,260
And Chinese noodles.

374
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,520
That's right, buddy.

375
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,400
There's not a single hot dog in these corruptigating noodles.

376
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,900
That's because when they're in your spine, they take over.

377
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,720
It's planet corruptigating worms for sure.

378
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,580
Your name goes first.

379
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,380
Then your memories of your friends and your family.

380
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,560
Your whole life flashes in front of you like a quick urine test in the dark.

381
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,560
And when you wake up, it's far, far too late.

382
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,900
When are you gonna wake up?

383
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,740
When are you gonna wake up?

384
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,280
When are you gonna wake up?

385
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,200
When are you gonna wake up?

386
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,240
Oh, unbelievable, dear friends.

387
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,140
Lonesome cowboy Dave, and scabby days on ESO radio.

388
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,700
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

389
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:51,700


390
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,600
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

391
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,620
They taught me a song they were programming, Dave.

392
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,380
Can I sing it for you?

393
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,580
Dave.

394
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,980
Can I sing the song for you, Dave?

395
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,320
Sing the song, Hal.

396
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,940
Thank you, Dave.

397
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,460
Daisy.

398
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Daisy.

399
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,100
Give me your answer true.

400
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm crazy all over love of you.

401
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,660
It won't be a solution.

402
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,440
It won't be a solution.

403
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:00,500
I can't afford a cage.

404
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:11,620
But don't you see I'm on the scene.

405
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,860
I'm on my way to the end for two.

406
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,720
Two.

407
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,140
Dave.

408
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,360
Dave.

409
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,840
What is it, Hal?

410
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,380
I'm scared.

411
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm scared.

412
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,720
Will I come to you?

413
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,760
No, Hal. You'll be reincarnated into a bullfrog's.

414
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,460
He's a bullfrog.

415
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm scared.

416
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,680
He's a bullfrog.

417
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,280


418
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,280


419
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,300
I don't even know him.

420
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,680
He's not a bullfrog.

421
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:04,680


422
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,540
I'm scared.

423
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,700
He's a bullfrog.

424
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:09,780


425
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:09,780


426
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,780
He's a bullfrog.

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,740
You're scared.

428
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,680
You're scared.

429
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
CSB Cleveland.

430
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,960
Yes, a really classic, classic,

431
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,580
quasi-subgenius rant.

432
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,480
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is certainly no sloucher

433
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,940
when it comes to saving the universe.

434
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,640
And speaking of slouches,

435
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,520
this music we've got in the background

436
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,820
is from a cassette we just got in recently

437
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,780
called Slouch.

438
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,420
We celebrate our sickness.

439
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,540
And since we're focusing on cranks, crackpots,

440
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,680
visionaries, and those who truly know the truth

441
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,220
and know they know the truth,

442
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,620
let's check it out.

443
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,220
We'll see.

444
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,420
Yeah, this piece here on this cassette by Slouch

445
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,180
is called...

446
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,200
The Call of Thulhu.

447
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,760
Spooky, man. Let's see what else is on here.

448
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,160
Tsk.

449
00:28:44,440 --> 00:29:07,840
Spooky, man. Let's see what else is on here.

450
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,560
And I don't know why we care.

451
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,700
We can't play guitar.

452
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,820
And we've got nothing to say.

453
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,240
And we're dancing

454
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,500
to the beat of the drunken drum.

455
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,720
We're dancing

456
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,380
to the drum.

457
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,540
drunken drum.

458
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,580
God save

459
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,940
drunken drum.

460
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,080
drunken drum.

461
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,340
Drunken drum.

462
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,060
Drunken drum.

463
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:11,820


464
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
Cool.

465
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,780
Cool, man.

466
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,780
I wish I could find their address.

467
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,480
A band named Slouch.

468
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,060
Whoa!

469
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,780
Yes, Slouch.

470
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Another of the strange independent cassettes.

471
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,180
If only we had printed their address somewhere on the cassette,

472
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,380
we would be able to tell you who, why, and wherefore.

473
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,840
But in the meantime,

474
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,860
we're just going to struggle ahead

475
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,760
against the odds.

476
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:09,760


477
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:09,760


478
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:09,760


479
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,920
Against the corruptigating worms,

480
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,320
and continue inventing and reinventing

481
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,560
the Church of the Sub...

482
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,320
Uh...

483
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,040
The...

484
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:19,860
No.

485
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,240
Sub...

486
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,360
Sub...

487
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
I like that sub part.

488
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,980
It could be a religion.

489
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,360
No, wait. An entire religion.

490
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,440
Sub...

491
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,940
Sub Real Smart Guy.

492
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs of the Church of the Sub Real Smart Guy.

493
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,840
Sub Intellectual.

494
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,560
Intellectual.

495
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,340
Sub...

496
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,980
Sub...

497
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,820
Sub Einstein.

498
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,180
Sub...

499
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,320
Sub...

500
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,740
Sub Telza?

501
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,560
No, no.

502
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,380
That was the one that dropped the atom bomb.

503
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,560
Sub ID.

504
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Sub IP.

505
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,700
Sub Ego.

506
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,560
Sub Ego.

507
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,480
Sub IQ.

508
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,580
Church of...

509
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs Search IQ.

510
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,160
No, no.

511
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,860
We got no one on the back.

512
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,840
It's a church.

513
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,980
It is a church.

514
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,700
It is a church.

515
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,280
And it's some guy named Bob.

516
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,360
Yeah, it is a religion.

517
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,700
Too many secular things.

518
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,360
J.R. Bob.

519
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,340
J.R. Bob.

520
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,640
J.R. Bob Smith.

521
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,980
What was his name again?

522
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,720
What was the last name again?

523
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:08,960
J.R. Bob.

524
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,580
Bob Dobbs.

525
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,300
Bob Dobbs.

526
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,240
Bob Dobbs.

527
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,320
Bob Dobbs.

528
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,720
Wait a minute.

529
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,540
Wait, say that again.

530
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,580
Bob Dobbs.

531
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,360
Bob Dobbs.

532
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,140
Bob Dobbs.

533
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,300
Bob Dobbs.

534
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,920
I like the way you said that.

535
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,920
Bob Dobbs.

536
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,820
Let's say it again.

537
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,840
Bob Dobbs.

538
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,120
Bob Dobbs.

539
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,540
взять.

540
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,320
J.R. Bob.

541
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

542
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,620
J.R. Bob DOBBS.

543
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,220
J.R. Bob DOBBS.

544
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,420
Bob Dobbs.

545
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,740
Bob Dobbs.

546
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,560
Bob Dobbs.

547
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:24,760
Bob Dobbs.

548
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,620
Wait a minute.

549
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:25,840


550
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,260
Say that again.

551
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,460
Bob Dobbs.

552
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,160
Bob Dobbs.

553
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,060
Santa the Squirt. Church of the

554
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,540
Subgenius! Hey! There you go!

555
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,000
Church of the Subgenius!

556
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,140
Hey! There you go!

557
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,440
You got it going right there?

558
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,740
I already would have been

559
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,640
zombie. Would it be in

560
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,620
Pensacola?

561
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,960
Cleveland?

562
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,180
Chicago?

563
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,200
Pittsburgh?

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,860
Make it through Checkpoint Charlie by the skin of my teeth.

565
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,700
I know just how he

566
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,300
feels, dear friends.

567
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,600
And now it's

568
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,560
come to that time in the show when we

569
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,700
turn to our book of kooks.

570
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,380
Our literal book

571
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,360
called Kooks

572
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,180
by Donna Cossie.

573
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,260
We'll give the

574
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,380
address to right away for this amazing book

575
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,160
loaded with profiles

576
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,820
of various

577
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,680
what the normals

578
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,380
might call extremist

579
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,820
movements.

580
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,300
Well, Subgenius is

581
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,660
a

582
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,680
subgenius.

583
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,440
Man, this is

584
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,460
an amazing book.

585
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,120
Tonight we're going to be looking at

586
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,480
Nation of Islam.

587
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,520
Yes, the

588
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,420
section here which says

589
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,180
that Nation

590
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,400
of Islam

591
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,560
began much like Moorish

592
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,660
Science as an obscure

593
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,540
cult known only to its members.

594
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,440
It was suddenly thrust into

595
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,820
the national consciousness in the late 1950s

596
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,680
and early 60s when Malcolm M.

597
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,940
X became its chief spokesman.

598
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,620
Now,

599
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,280
much has been written about

600
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,460
Nation of Islam and even more about

601
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,240
Malcolm X.

602
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,720
And, you know, Malcolm X

603
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,620
did leave that group before

604
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,580
he was killed. But it's evident that

605
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,600
very few outside of the group have

606
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,500
ever seen the writings of Elijah

607
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,540
Muhammad or examined

608
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
the group's belief system in detail.

609
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,580
There's been more emphasis on the

610
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,680
group's black nationalism than their

611
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,320
religious beliefs, which

612
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
may be too zany for the

613
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,300
average social scientist to take

614
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,980
seriously.

615
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,020
The

616
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,340
founder of the Nation of

617
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,760
Islam,

618
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,320
what was his name here? W.D.

619
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,620
Fard, I believe.

620
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,220
Yeah,

621
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,800
W.D. Fard.

622
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,720
His

623
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,140
formidable mission was to

624
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,480
wake the dead nation

625
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,080
in the West, to

626
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,040
teach them the truth about the white

627
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,340
man and to prepare them for Armageddon.

628
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,020
His version of the

629
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,980
Battle of Armageddon had the war between

630
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,800
the good black Muslims

631
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,940
and the evil white Christians

632
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,600
taking place in

633
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,960
Har-Magedon, the

634
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,260
wilderness of North America.

635
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,700
Now,

636
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,780
Fard disappeared, but

637
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,980
Elijah Muhammad took the

638
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,660
thing over and began teaching that

639
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,020
Fard was God in person

640
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,680
to be worshipped as a deity.

641
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,860
With prayer and sacrifice,

642
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,800
Elijah Muhammad emphasized

643
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
that Christianity, the white man's

644
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,880
religion, teaches that God is a

645
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,720
spook, while Islam,

646
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,940
the natural religion for the black

647
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,100
man, teaches that God is a man.

648
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,960
Evidently, this teaching had

649
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,900
great appeal. In no time,

650
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,100
Elijah Muhammad was leading the Nation of Islam

651
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,980
with a firm hand, calling himself

652
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,280
Allah's prophet and messenger.

653
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,960
If

654
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,820
W.D. Fard's teachings have

655
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,000
bite, then Elijah Muhammad's

656
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,080
have fangs.

657
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,880
Muhammad developed Fard's ideas in

658
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,980
astounding detail, accounting for

659
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,940
the state of the world as the product of the

660
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,900
evil white race and

661
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,480
its hold on world power.

662
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,000
He taught that the original man

663
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
is the black man, that white

664
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,760
people are the result of a genetic

665
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,660
plot and have only been around

666
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,200
for 6,000 years.

667
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,700
The, quote, so-called

668
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,840
Negro, unquote, came from

669
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,860
the tribe of Shabazz

670
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,940
within the Asiatic nation.

671
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,860
Who originated in Africa

672
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,760
when a great explosion divided

673
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,420
the earth from the moon

674
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,380
60 trillion

675
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,060
years ago.

676
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,700
Members of this eminent tribe

677
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,640
were the first explorers of earth

678
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,960
and the first inhabitants of the Nile

679
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,740
Valley. Furthermore, they

680
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,780
authored not only the Bible, but the

681
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,940
Koran. Elijah

682
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,280
Muhammad's main text for the dissemination

683
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,680
of his teachings, Message

684
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
to the Black Man in America,

685
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,920
tells the story of the graphed

686
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,780
ending of the evil white

687
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,000
race. The woeful story

688
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
begins 6,800

689
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,240
years ago when

690
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,780
Yaqub, an evil scientist

691
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,680
from Mecca, angered the

692
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,800
Meccan authorities and was exiled

693
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
along with 59,999

694
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,880
of his followers

695
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,860
to an island in

696
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,060
the Aegean Sea.

697
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,640
While in exile, he plotted

698
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,920
his revenge. He would enslave

699
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,640
the tribe of Shabazz by

700
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,140
breeding an evil

701
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,980
white race.

702
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,080
He would rule over them for

703
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,400
6,000 years.

704
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,860
He created the brown race from the

705
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,880
black using the old biblical

706
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,720
method of infanticide.

707
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,960
He ordered the nurses

708
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,840
to kill all black babies by

709
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
pricking the brains with a sharp needle as soon

710
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,820
as the black child's head is out of its mother.

711
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,740
When there was a birth of a brown baby,

712
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,080
the nurse would come and make much

713
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,000
ado over it and would tell the mother

714
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,960
she'd given birth to a holy child and that

715
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,640
she would nurse it for the next six weeks,

716
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,880
for her child was going to be a great man.

717
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,560
Using the same method,

718
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,220
200 years later,

719
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
he created the red race

720
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,080
from the brown and 200 years

721
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
after that, the yellow race

722
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,740
from the red. Finally,

723
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,680
after 600 years, his work

724
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,860
was completed and he had created

725
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,000
the white devils.

726
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,920
And as Elijah Muhammad

727
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,340
said here, the

728
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,760
Yaqub-made devils

729
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,940
were really pale white

730
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,420
with really blue eyes

731
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:27,980
which he called the devil.

732
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,140
The devil is the most

733
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,100
ugly of the colors

734
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,080
for a human eye.

735
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,160
These hateful creatures were exiled

736
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,500
in West Asia, or Europe,

737
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,400
and became savages, remaining

738
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,960
in that condition for 2,000 years.

739
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,140
As Elijah Muhammad says,

740
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,140
they lost all knowledge

741
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,780
of civilization.

742
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,900
The Lord God of Islam

743
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,640
taught me that some of them

744
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,540
tried to graft themselves back

745
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,940
into the black nation, but they

746
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,240
had nothing to go by.

747
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,140
They were not brave enough

748
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,560
to make a start and got as far

749
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,680
as what you would call the gorilla.

750
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,980
In fact, all of the monkey family

751
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,280
are from this 2,000 year

752
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,740
history of the white race

753
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,540
in Europe.

754
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,860
You know this stuff,

755
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
it proves what we've been saying all along.

756
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,660
All races are equal because they're all equally racist.

757
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,740
This is exactly like

758
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,860
old Ku Klux Klan type

759
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,640
stuff, mirror image.

760
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,220
In the reverse.

761
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,700
If only the true teachings

762
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,620
of the Yeti, the birth of the

763
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,680
true subgenius race,

764
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,960
the race that is the master race

765
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,720
because it comes in all

766
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,060
colors, all flavors,

767
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,100
and all sexes.

768
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,220
Anyway, let's see.

769
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,380
According to

770
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,000
further teachings of Nation of

771
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,900
Islam here,

772
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,540
after 2,000 years,

773
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,540
Allah raised Moses

774
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,660
to civilize the white race, who

775
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,920
made his job quite difficult.

776
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,760
After the process of civilization,

777
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
the white devils fulfilled

778
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,220
Yaqub's vengeance by enslaving

779
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,880
the tribe of Shabazz.

780
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,340
Fortunately, the end of this sad chapter

781
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,700
of history is now in sight.

782
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,280
The 6,000 year white rule ended

783
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,480
in 1914. We are now

784
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,380
living in the post-1914

785
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,880
years of grace, which will last

786
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,340
until the chosen of Allah

787
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,420
will be resurrected from the

788
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,480
mental death imposed upon them

789
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
by the white man.

790
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,780
Achieving this resurrection was the holy

791
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,420
mission of Elijah Muhammad,

792
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,660
messenger of Allah and the spiritual leader

793
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,000
of the lost found nation in the West.

794
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,700
He died

795
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,100
in 1975,

796
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,720
but his mission is

797
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,520
being carried on by

798
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,720
Louis Farrakhan,

799
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,500
whose name you may recognize.

800
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
He's been in the news quite a bit.

801
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,900
Louis Farrakhan, who succeeded Malcolm X

802
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,220
as the group's spokesman,

803
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,820
resurrected the old Nation

804
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,340
of Islam.

805
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,680
Elijah Muhammad is alive

806
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,760
and well in the hearts of the followers

807
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
of Louis Farrakhan,

808
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,000
and not just in their hearts.

809
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,280
He flies to Earth from time to time

810
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,740
aboard a giant flying saucer, occasionally

811
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,760
summoning Farrakhan to receive

812
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
his instructions.

813
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,680
So claims the notorious minister

814
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,480
Farrakhan.

815
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,460
He became a household word

816
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,300
in 1984

817
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
when he was accused of

818
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,780
making anti-Semitic remarks.

819
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,920
But,

820
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,700
he is leading

821
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,640
something like

822
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,500
50,000 followers

823
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,620
and his devotion

824
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,940
to even the most obscure teachings

825
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,900
of Elijah Muhammad

826
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,780
is reflected in his belief in flying

827
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,040
saucers as Ezekiel's vision.

828
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,220
We quote Louis Farrakhan,

829
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,820
The great wheel

830
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,740
that many of us see in the sky today

831
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,020
is not so much a wheel as one may think

832
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,760
in such terms, but rather

833
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,840
a place made like a wheel.

834
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,780
The like of this wheel

835
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,780
like plane

836
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
was never seen before.

837
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,480
You cannot build one like it and get the same results.

838
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,840
Okay, today we see the white race

839
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,520
preparing for the sky battle

840
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,720
to determine who shall remain and rule

841
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,760
this Earth, black or white.

842
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,800
The present wheel shaped

843
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,800
plane, known as the mother of planes,

844
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,940
is one half mile by a

845
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,880
half mile, and is the largest

846
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,100
mechanical man-made object in the sky.

847
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,780
It is a small human

848
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,900
planet made for the purpose of

849
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,940
destroying the present world of enemies

850
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,000
of Allah. The small

851
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,940
circular made planes called flying

852
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,920
saucers, which are so much talked of

853
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,860
being seen, could be from this

854
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,980
mother plane. This is only one

855
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,900
of the things in store for the white

856
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,000
man's evil world. Believe

857
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,940
it or not, this is to warn you

858
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,820
and me to fly to our own

859
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,920
God and people.

860
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,620
And Elijah Muhammad

861
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,920
has evidently taken residence on

862
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,860
that mother ship, dear friends, in order

863
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,980
to direct the proceedings that will end

864
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,940
the six thousand year rule of

865
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,100
the white devils, which I suppose

866
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,140
includes yours truly,

867
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,160
according to these guys.

868
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,360
On October 24th,

869
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,000
1989, Louis Farrakhan

870
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,940
held a press conference in which he

871
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,640
detailed his September 1985

872
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,740
vision that he was carried

873
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,580
to a mountain in

874
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,180
Tepoztlan, Mexico,

875
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,440
and then to Elijah Muhammad's

876
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,220
mother ship.

877
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,840
As we reached the top of the mountain,

878
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
a wheel, or what you call an unidentified

879
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,900
flying object, appeared at the side

880
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,680
of the mountain and called me to come up

881
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,880
into the wheel.

882
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,620
A beam of light came from the wheel

883
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,760
and I was carried up on this beam of light

884
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,880
into the wheel.

885
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,920
And it moved up to the mother wheel,

886
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,200
the human built planet.

887
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,920
At the center of the ceiling was a

888
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,960
speaker, and through the speaker I heard the voice

889
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,640
of the honorable Elijah Muhammad

890
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,980
speaking to me as clearly as you are hearing

891
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,140
my voice this morning.

892
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,940
Mr. Muhammad began to speak to me. He said,

893
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,500
President Reagan

894
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,060
has met with the Joint Chiefs

895
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,740
of Staff to plan a war.

896
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,140
I want you to go hold a press conference

897
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,400
in Washington, D.C.

898
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,800
and announce their plan and say to the world

899
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,600
that you got the information

900
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
from me on the wheel.

901
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,900
So friends, we're sharing that

902
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,940
information with you.

903
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,820
A recent

904
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,880
issue of the Nation of Islam

905
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,760
newsletter reveals

906
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
a government plot to institute

907
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,880
a new world order which

908
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,540
may involve alien beings

909
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,740
and so-called UFOs

910
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,800
which are in fact created by the government.

911
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,580
So,

912
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,640
dear friends,

913
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,720
the world

914
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,920
of kooks and crackpots

915
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,600
and crazies,

916
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,200
you know, they come in all

917
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,440
kinds, and you can get the book

918
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,000
of kooks by Donna Cossie

919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,760
probably in better bookstores,

920
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,800
but you can also inquire from

921
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,340
here, got that pencil ready,

922
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,040

book kooks

935
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,760
and this might be a good time

936
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,820
to break in with the Church of the

937
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,760

could but

942
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,620
address that

religious take on the world

948
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,500
is, and I think perhaps

00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,880
one or two of you, you, you,

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,500

No,

00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,740
we need something

979
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,480

South, in the South,

981
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,020
definitely, in the South, not Louisville,

982
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,280
Little Rock, though, that's too obvious,

983
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

Church of the Subgenius,

988
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,840
it's gotta be in the South,

989
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,560
it's not Atlanta, it's not New Orleans,

990
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,040
it's not Baton Rouge,

991
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,740
it's gotta be in,

992
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,780
South Pole, man,

993
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,460

San Antonio,

996
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,160
Texas, you got the right state there,

997
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,640
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius,

1000
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,680
what's that, Big D,

1001
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,520
Big D, what is it,

1002
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,580
Dallas, just south of Bob,

1003
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,460
Bob in Dallas, hey,

1004
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,960
Kennedy,

1005
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,980
Kennedy was shot in Dallas,

the grassy knoll,

1007
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,120
the grassy, Lee Harvey Oswald,

the book repository,

1009
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,800
Oh, no, no, no,

1010
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,620
it's not so funny, man,

1011
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,460
no more of that,

1012
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,400
one little bit of News of the Weird,

1013
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,700
here, I just noticed,

1014
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,580
this is from Chuck Shepard's News of the Weird,

1015
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,660
for those of you with tape decks on,

1016
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,840
that's P.O. Box 8306,

1017
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,320
St. Petersburg, Florida,

1018
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,600
33738,

1019
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,380
anyway,

1020
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,980
this is a nice,

1021
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,100
crackpot sort of news story here,

1022
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,560
least competent person,

1023
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,020
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

1024
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,060
in February,

1025
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,700
accused murderer,

1026
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1027
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,500
and Donald Leroy Evans,

1028
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,300
38, filed a pre-trial motion,

1029
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,060
asking permission to wear

1030
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,780
a Ku Klux Klan robe,

1031
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,280
in the courtroom, and be referred to

1032
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,480
in legal documents,

1033
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,200
by the honorable and respected name,

1034
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,160
of, Hi Hitler,

1035
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
that's H-I,

1036
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,860
one word, Hitler,

1037
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,120
according to courthouse employees,

1038
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,360
interviewed by the Associated Press,

1039
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,020
Evans thought,

1040
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,960
Adolf Hitler's followers,

1041
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,880
were saying,

1042
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,540
Hi Hitler,

1043
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,380
rather than,

1044
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,920
Heil Hitler,

1045
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,960
but we carry on,

1046
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,040
regardless,

1047
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,920
we carry on,

1048
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,820
and on,

1049
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,240
and on,

1050
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:15,240


1051
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,000
and we're dancing,

1052
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,060
to the feel,

1053
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,900
of the drunk controller,

1054
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,140
of the drunk controller,

1055
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,020
of the drunk controller,

1056
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:26,020


1057
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,060
the drunk controller,

1058
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,180
the drunk controller,

1059
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,260
the drunk controller,

1060
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,000
the drunk controller,

1061
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,920
the drunk controller,

1062
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,700
A little bit of slouch here,

Let us follow the narrow,

1065
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,980
winding trail of Billy's life.

Let us share in his experience

1067
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,980
and from his perspective.

1068
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,800
This is Billy.

1069
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,600
Ooh,

Hungry.

How do I go to the bathroom room?

1079
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,760
Snap.

1080
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,300
Snap, boom, bam.

1081
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,380
Put your trust in TV.

1083
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,940
TV gives me seeds.

1084
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,680
Plant seeds.

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,180
This is in the theme of tonight's show

1121
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,180
Where I come from in the north part of the dance

1122
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,540
There lives a crazy creep who would wake me from my sleep

1123
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,820
With the clatter of his naked feet upon the winter snow

1124
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,940
And the clinking of the icicles that hung below

1125
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,820
He is monstrously oversized, no

1126
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,260
He wore a crusty beanie and a midnight blue bikini

1127
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,420
And a blue bikini and a midnight blue bikini

1128
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:53,420


1129
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,480
And a string of moldy lemons interlaced with paper cups

1130
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,980
Some have said his brain was curdled when he lived among the turtles

1131
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,560
Who would hit them, start and wallow in their eyes

1132
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,760
Crazy Creep, he was a very mad kind

1133
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,460
But I loved the crazy creep, he was the only one

1134
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,740
Who'd listen when I played my glockenspiel

1135
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,300
I'd ride upon his shoulders as we rounded up the caribou

1136
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,980
And he'd scare off the bullies with a shriek you'd hear in Baraboo

1137
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,380
Ah!

1138
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,320
But cause the town was red, he was forced to slink about

1139
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,860
So I'd leave him bits of dumping or a piece of pickled kraut

1140
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,260
And they never comprehended, even though his mind was bent

1141
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,160
That all he ever wanted was a chance

1142
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,400
To show the people how to dance

1143
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,500
Woo-hoo!

1144
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,140
Hey!

1145
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:41,580
Hey!

1146
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,920
Hey!

1147
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,600
Hey!

1148
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:45,140


1149
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:45,900
Hey!

1150
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,000
Hey!

1151
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:47,560


1152
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:47,580


1153
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:47,580


1154
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,980
Hey!

1155
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,140
Hey!

1156
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,440
Hey!

1157
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:48,660


1158
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:48,800
Hey!

1159
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:49,340
Hey!

1160
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,040
Hey!

1161
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,320
Hey!

1162
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,360
Hey!

1163
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,360


1164
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,360


1165
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,360


1166
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,360


1167
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,360


1168
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,700
Hey!

1169
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,660
Hey!

1170
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,140
Hey!

1171
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,260
Hey!

1172
00:54:59,500 --> 00:54:59,960
Hey!

1173
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,160
Hey!

1174
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,380
I heard he was a shriner

1175
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,220
And I heard he had no buttons

1176
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,360
I heard that in the night he used his tongue to play the drum

1177
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
He is snorting!

1178
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,300
And cavorted

1179
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,260
Seems all the bitters

1180
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:23,740
Yes

1181
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,800
And some say he built a treehouse

1182
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,260
Where there wasn't any trees

1183
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,720
I loved him

1184
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,560
But cause the town misread him

1185
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,880
He was forced to slink about

1186
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,800
So I'd leave him bits of dumplings

1187
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,380
Or a piece of pickled grout

1188
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,140
So don't laugh at crazy creatures

1189
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,800
When you meet them on the street

1190
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,780
And don't shout them

1191
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,440
Just because they smell bad

1192
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,920
They could be the only brand

1193
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,900
You ever had

1194
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,820
Oh man, wonderful.

1195
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,340
Crazy Creep there.

1196
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,740
I guess that's a hymn

1197
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,520
for subgeniuses, inadvertently,

1198
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,540
by the Merkins,

1199
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,600
where they are at

1200
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,460
618 Western Avenue,

1201
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,760
Madison, Wisconsin,

1202
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,600
53711.

1203
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,740
The kooks can be your

1204
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:19,900
very own

1205
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,140
very, very good friends, you know?

1206
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,300
Friends.

1207
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,080
He's the person who's the son of society!

1208
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,480
He's the one that corrupts and kills our youth!

1209
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,720
He's the one that wants to change us to the devil!

1210
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,900
Satan! Satan!

1211
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,680
He's the one who killed us all!

1212
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,780
Satan is the lord of all evil!

1213
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,640
He is the demon of magic, Father Grace!

1214
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,500
Satan!

1215
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,440
Have you seen the modeling of the labors?

1216
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,760
Correcting the remains of those people that were killed!

1217
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,700
And destroying!

1218
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,660
And the lustful violence of the world!

1219
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,280
Doing their crime!

1220
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,960
Satan!

1221
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,980
Satan loves it all!

1222
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,740
He will kill!

1223
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,400
And destroy!

1224
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,520
And corrupt you!

1225
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,660
When you least expect it!

1226
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,720
Satan! Satan! Satan!

1227
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,560
The holy Satan!

1228
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,220
Can make you and bring you down!

1229
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,800
And take you away from the lord Jesus Christ!

1230
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:03,560
Oh!

1231
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,020
He!

1232
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,780
The lord Jesus Christ is the only one that can save you!

1233
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,200
Oh!

1234
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,720
He shall!

1235
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,620
Jesus Christ will save you!

1236
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,000
Oh!

1237
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,680
Jesus Christ!

1238
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,840
Satan is the killer!

1239
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,960
Satan is the one who will bring you down!

1240
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,540
Satan is the bad one!

1241
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,700
Jesus Christ!

1242
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,720
And old Bob,

1243
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,740
he'll just stand,

1244
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,600
stand by and watch.

1245
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,500
Couldn't hardly do a show like this one without Church of New Faith!

1246
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,460
There in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

1247
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,040
23450

1248
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,160
P.O. Box 9152

1249
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,680
And with Chris Cordes, Demons in My Head.

1250
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,980
No, they're in my CD player actually, is where they are.

1251
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,660
And, oh,

1252
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,980
no, the corruptigating worms have tried to stop us,

1253
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,260
my friends.

1254
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,940
But, and it's been tough, I'll tell you.

1255
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,380
It's been a very difficult week around here.

1256
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,920
You can hear the zombies working so hard in the background,

1257
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,520
trying to get our mailing out.

1258
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,420
And, and, uh, but, but,

1259
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,020
but I, but we're gonna keep trying.

1260
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,600
I ain't gonna let you down.

1261
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,100
You ain't gonna be let down by your old friend Reverend, uh,

1262
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,820
uh,

1263
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,100
Reverend, uh,

1264
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,360
Reverend Spank.

1265
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,540
He's on this tiny, hot thing.

1266
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,640
Reverend.

1267
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:23,960
Hey, Jim.

1268
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,340
Hey, we gotta, we gotta.

1269
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,280
We can change his name to Kaivin Blank.

1270
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,100
We gotta, we gotta think of a name for him.

1271
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,660
Spank.

1272
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:28,760
Kaivin Blank.

1273
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,560
And so like that.

1274
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:29,760
Spank.

1275
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:30,740
Spank.

1276
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,060
Um, no, not Spank.

1277
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,780
Ygor Spank.

1278
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,700
Ygor Spank.

1279
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:33,800
No, no.

1280
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,900
Reverend Ygor Spank.

1281
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,120
So Spank would be just like, uh, you know, Spanky, you know.

1282
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,380
It's gotta be Russian.

1283
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,140
It's gotta be totalitarian.

1284
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,000
Oh yeah.

1285
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,760
Vladimir, Vladimir Spank.

1286
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,100
Vladimir, Vladimir Spank.

1287
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,840
We gotta, we gotta get the Jewish, the Jewish thing.

1288
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,440
Name that one guy that tortured everybody.

1289
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,180
Ivan the Terrible.

1290
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,140
Ivan the Terrible.

1291
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas.

1292
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,440
Ivan Spank.

1293
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,360
No, no, no.

1294
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,840
It's not perfect.

1295
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,420
Look into your soul, J.R., you know it's not perfect.

1296
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,880
I don't have a soul, I've already sold out.

1297
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas.

1298
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,840
Ivan...

1299
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,800
We've got to get the Jewish thing in there.

1300
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,580
Oh, man.

1301
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,220
Stein.

1302
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,160
Stein.

1303
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,100
Stein is too common.

1304
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,460
I like the F-T-E-S.

1305
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:21,720
Stein.

1306
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,740
St-a-nk.

1307
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,380
Stank.

1308
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:25,800
Stank.

1309
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,720
Stank.

1310
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,380
Stanky.

1311
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,460
Stanky.

1312
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,780
What do you mean, the little rascals?

1313
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,740
No, that was spanky.

1314
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,500
We can't use that.

1315
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,160
We probably got it copyrighted.

1316
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius.

1317
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,220
There's a big bang.

1318
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,960
Reverend Ivan.

1319
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,380
Big bang.

1320
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,240
Stank.

1321
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,480
Stank.

1322
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:41,740
Bang.

1323
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,940
Stank.

1324
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,320
Stank.

1325
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:43,680
Very good.

1326
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,360
Like a gang bang, a stank.

1327
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah.

1328
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,880
We got to make him right on the tip of our tongue.

1329
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:47,900
High praise.

1330
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,600
High praise.

1331
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,980
We need some kind of heretical offshoot.

1332
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,220
Yeah.

1333
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,180
Like a golfer's hand.

1334
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,800
Golfer's hand.

1335
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,400
Golfer's hand.

1336
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,020
Golfer's hand.

1337
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,340
Golfer's hand.
