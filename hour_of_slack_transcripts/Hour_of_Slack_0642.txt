Oh, yeah.
My name is Chaz,
and I'm broadcasting you tonight
from my little holding cell here,
all quarantined,
all strapped in my suit,
pressure suit's all pressured up.
Yeah.
It's here.
The ship is waiting, hissing away,
spewing out its little steam,
waiting for the moment,
the final countdown.
And that's where we're at,
just hours away from the final hour.
The final minute, the final second.
X-Day.
Thought it'd never get here.
It's kind of late now.
We're there.
There's nothing else to do.
Just sit, look out the window,
and wait for the light.
And shaky gravity copy
You read it.

Is your pleasureship
hovering above,
waiting for the final hours to pass?
Who is it?
Is it your alien sex goddess
waiting for you?
You're standing inunal,
somewhere
in Eurasia
blue.
My name is
We'll see you.
Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye, Dad.
I gotta go into space.
One, two.
Hey, Bleepo.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Down to a few hours now.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, I was...
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
I was under some understanding that
they were gonna install some black, black box
in the studio here.
I don't know what the technology of this really is.
You know, like I say,
I don't understand how a lot of this is gonna,
you know, take place.
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.
I just know that it won't fail because of me.
I'm gonna do six and a half million pounds.
We all are in this together as a team effort.
We're gonna make it work.
And I don't know how to make it work.
I don't know how to do most of this mission.
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.
And it won't fail because of me.
Hello, world.
Hello, world.
Chaz here.
ESO is here.

ESO Radio broadcasting live from the Pleasure Ships.
Oh, yeah.
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
When the sex goddesses come for you.
Going up to die.
Going up to the spirit in the sky.
Going up to the spirit in the sky.
It's where I'm gonna go when I die.
When I die and the day not your best.
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best.
And it's so beautiful from out here.
It's so pretty, the Earth.
It's just that little blue and white, little marble hanging there.
Gosh, that's where it all began.
We'll see ya.
Goodbye.
Prepare yourself.
You know it's a must.
Gonna have a friend in Jesus.
A friend in Bob.
So you know that when you die.
Bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky.
Swamp Radio.
Radio.
Radio.
It's so pretty.
Carry on in your 2009 Jesus.
Failure is not an option.
Happenings have been going further and further backwards in my career as I get better at what I do.
Well, at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio bleep-o.
There are those of us that...
I would say major disappointment might be the word used.
But he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair.
I mean, I don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation or...
There was major disappointment and there was General Electric.
Oh, there...
I thought you were gonna refer to the guy's erection again.
And then there was Admiral Bob.
Bob.
Just like a penguin in bondage, boing.
You know, on X-Day, Neegie will return to us all the greatest tapes that we ever recorded.
Praise the Neegie.
Which he has been keeping in.
Praise the Neegie.
Oh, God, that's so good.
Neegie has been keeping all of our lost recordings in a special vault.
You hear that, brother?
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.
Oh, that's so glorious.
Jayner will get his 8mm films back.
Oh, the stuff.
You know, your first show will come back.
I'll...
Actually, I never did lose anything.
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?
As long as you saw them, Bill.
Things that...
I mean, um...
You mean everything I've ever seen?
You know, that you never got around to looking at?
Uh-huh.
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second?
What about events that I've never taped that never were taped?
There's a thing called the new program.
The things that you thought...
What?
This is too damn confusing.
...that you imagined very vividly doing...
I'm getting out of here.
...will then be done.
They will have been done.
When you want to do a wonderful new show, that show will materialize in your hand as
a tape.
Yeah, the new program.
We...
We...
We...
We...
We...
We...
We...
We...

We...

Yea.
Well, sheesh, that's, that's, that's...
...the Anunnaki is related to the Oshitashi, which you often get, you know, when served
with wasabi.
Yea.
And it's in conjunction with the uni and the unagi.
And the hiroshi.
And the inaka.
And the wasabi.
And the wasabi, yeah.
All of these things, you combine them.
These things become combined.
For the normals, they become combined in sort of a slurry shop.
We subgeniuses luckily will get the fresh human soul sushi, as it were.
Yeah, on demand.
On demand.
Sushi on demand 24 hours a day, even in Cleveland.
Yeah.
Now I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I'm living in Arizona.
I work with my hands in a land born free
Live in a white house in Canyon du Chez
And what I take I give to live in me
For when this is a universe
Through your eyes it sees and knows
That certain beauties are a state of mind
Or so it's thought they just walk the clock into the light
I work with my hands
I work with my hands
Living castles made out of sand
I'm riding alone out on my own
In a land of sand

And I'm riding alone out on my own In a land of sand
And I'm riding alone out on my own In a land of sand
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
Come on
guitar solo
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
I'm living in Arizona
Goodbye mom
Goodbye dad
I gotta go get space mom
I gotta go get to the camp
I gotta go out into space
Goodbye mom
I'm never coming home
We're gonna give you one more little song
You know you should go
Hey this year at Starwood
We are Einstein Secret Orchestra
And we'll be playing in the Puffer Dome
From midnight to three in the morning tonight
On Friday night at Starwood
This year yeah
Friday night
We'll be puffing it all night in the Domo
Beam in
Beam in
From the pleasure ships
Holographic images only
Please
A lyric little song
Perhaps maybe a child's nursery rhyme
Perhaps a little didgeridoo song
From an aboriginal
A little song that a child would sing
Wouldn't swing his eucalyptus leaves on his head
And make a crown of thorns for himself
To become the aboriginal messiah
And save the red rocks from these
And that
And this
And those cars going by
That time of year
And that toxic polluted swamp over there
And those red glowing rocks over there
And that meteor falling through the earth
We can't even comprehend what we might have been
We can't even think about where we might have gone
It all takes too long
Just keep your eye on the red rocks
Just keep walking by the river
Oh that's so pretty
It made everyone weep in the moon
Oh that's so pretty



We'll meet them soon, the inside
I'm touched
You've been touched so many times
You're as soiled as a bad pair of underwear at the bus station
Please don't touch me again
I'll try not to
They make me say things
They make me do things
Hit me
They make me wear the moon pants
They didn't make you do any of that, man
Ah but the moon billies wear the shaggiest moon pants you've ever seen man
And they're packed with all kinds of strange ideas
I'm afraid those shaggy pants are the ones that I can't take care of


things aren't pants those are moon dogs i thought they were the bad ideas sheeping out of their legs
the bad what are we going to do about all the bad ideas we can rebuild him we have the technology
one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small the world ends sunday week
i like the way that sounds world end sunday week
for more enjoyment and greater efficiency consumption is being standardized okay i'm
going to look for ways to express concretely uh love to passion passion you're uh kind of like
the frog and the prince guy that you've got
this uh super being inside of you which is imprisoned in this evil flesh and you keep
struggling with this evil flesh so you can become a god but most people don't they become like kind
of petty devils that go from one low comedy to another with the rats dangling out of their pants
it's a stinky word because there's no law norther anymore it's a stinky word because it lets the
young get onto the old like you don't oh it's no order for an old man and he's a man of his own
i think it's the only church i know of where where a preacher willingly exploits himself
for his own i'm doing it for bob for bob's well yeah it's no different from any other religion
in that respect we'll cheat anybody the whole thing is a gigantic it's one of the greatest
most gigantic cheats that human humanity has ever conceived of praise bob
princess we did you do your your tale and song
yeah we can play it in three different keys
is it is it going to be the show ends in half an hour forever and ever
yeah but unfortunately as you said it goes on and on and on forever
and once again we must remember to keep our focus as we project out there i don't know
exactly if we call it there it exists simultaneously in so many different places
have you hit him yeah no that's
�י be okay
yes
but all that i i thought you each time you want to








you better startee
about many us
Back it up.
We have to sing.
Back it up.
Beatles songs out the window, Leepo.
I heard it.
All right, here we go.
There was the pop record.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Picture yourself
afloat in the cosmos
in a pleasure ship vessel
of your own design.
Somebody calls you
you answer quite slowly
cause you're so incredibly high.
And then your saucers
appear on the shore
waiting to take us
the next day.
Climb on the deck
with our heads in the clouds
and we're gone.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.
Ah!
Picture yourself
in your own private garden
with lobsters,
trees,
and fresh figgy pies.
I didn't like the figgy.
It's my product.
Somebody calls you
you answer but dronely.
The girl with calliope signs.
More pleasure saucers
appear on the shore
waiting to take us
the next day.
Climb on the deck
with our heads in the clouds
and we're gone.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.
Loomies will not die
with Simon.

with Simon.
Loomies will not die


I...
Picture yourself
all asleep
in a fountain
where charcoal tyrannosaurus
leave kisses behind.
Suddenly someone comes by
and awaits you


You cannot keep either face inattenance.


The stars will be dark, the sky will be dark.
I won't see them, but I'll see them.
Strange, but I'll come in.
I won't see them, but I'll come in.
I won't see them, but I'll come in.
I won't see them, but I'll come in.
Now, I know you'd really like to know just who Simon is, but I'm sorry.
Sorry? That's one of the wee mysteries you'll just have to figure out for yourself.
Everyone gets the Simon they deserve.
And everyone gets that destiny they choose.
I know you ordained that genius, but you know exactly what that means.
I know exactly what that means.
But for the...
For those of you who are somehow yet unsaved,
there are nine more holy and complete days where the post office will be open.
And if you don't know what to do, call one...
Nine.
Six.
Nine.
Six.
Nine.
Six.
Nine.
And ask.
Operators are standing by.
But we...
We...
That's me.
Are not standing by.
By those...
We...
We're ready.
And we will greet you as you board the pleasure ship.
Just a little.
With both horn lights flashing brightly, we will...
We even will place the lei around your neck, kiss you on the cheek, and send you on your merry way.
Into the escape vessel.
But for now...
We out.
We out.
E-S-O.
We out.
Gotta go.
We out.
We out.
For now.
And you get your own free wee bell.
We out.
Oh, wow.
I don't know.
That's not the wee bell.
The wee bell is...
No, the wee bell is a wee bell.
And it's a wee bell because...
Not because she is wee like in this cottage or I always wear it because she says wee.
Oh, no.
I bet, I bet.
Oh, man.
She always says wee.
Ah, yes.
Oh, wee.
Simple.
Simple.
El dido.
El dido.
El dido.
Oui, oui, oui.
There are hands sticking out of the walls.
Yeah.
And when the Bosch came, we had to hide and think about when Bob would come and liberate
us and put us in little tiny pleasure ships about the size of this pack of girl right here.
Oh, yes.
You see, we had to shrink because our heads were so big from staying in the basement.
But you can't surprise us.
Yes.
Because...
Well, I can't wait till the subgenius exhibit opens in the new Disney world.
Ah, what...
You know, now, don't start counting your chickens before the hatch, Bleepo.
Well...
And don't talk about...
You promised me a job 50 years ago before I was born.
Uh...
Well, me too.
Me too.
They...
Most of us.
But...
Um...
St. Palmer Vreedies, uh...
Speculated that...
You know, what if, on X-Day, the exes, the, you know, sex goddesses from outer...
From Planet X arrive...
Mm-hmm.
In saucers.
Saucers.
The size of little tiny shirt butts.
And they fly around hovering like gnats in front of our faces going,
Well, get on board.
Get on board.
And then what we do...
And then they, you know, get tired of waiting and they fly away and fly away and fly away and...
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.
5,000, 6,200, what is everything all right down there?
Are you willing to follow us?
That accident over in Red Sector L destroyed another 63 personnel,
giving them a total of 242.
Two lost to our 195.
Keep up the good work and prevent accidents.
John and Yoko, Kimmy, Leary, Rosemary, Tommy Smothers, Bobby, Dylan, Tommy, Cooper, Derek, Taylor, Norman, Mailer, Allen, Ginsburg,
Hare Krishna, Hare, Hare, Hare Krishna.
All we are saying is give peace a chance.
Now, sing it for the Senate.
Oh, God.
All we are saying...
All we are saying...
Is give peace a chance.
Personally, I like to think of myself as the most sweetness and light New Age, love-oriented subgenius.
And I know that the 33,000 saucers of Planet X will line up from North Pole to South Pole across this globe.
Let the world turn under it.
And loonies will not die.
That's right.
For Simon, with Simon.
They will have nothing to do with Simon.
Loonies will fly, arise, up, up, up, above the atmosphere.
Far, far, as they depressurize, their heads will swell.
Even the poor, innocent loonies who don't know of Bob.
Like balloons, they will swell as they depressurize, floating ever higher up, out into the stratosphere.
Out into the stratosphere.
The O-O-Sphere.
The DNA-O-Sphere.
The fly-way above the countryside.
The Dave-O-Sphere.
And finally, the most furthest out from the solar system, surrounding like a great bubble the solar system, the We-O-Sphere.
And it's really weird out there.
But there can be other creatures in this alien environment.
Hunters.
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.
They eat the floaters.
Both for their organic molecules.
And for their store of pure hydrogen.
But there can't be many hunters.
Because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves will perish.
Give birth to the little onion-headed boys.
The little onion-headed boys and girls.
With such pale skin.
Made for exterior voyages of sheer glandular pleasure.
Pleasure.
And we may talk about pleasure ships.
You don't know, like I don't.
My glands just...
Exploded with delight as we passed...
Well, it wasn't a galaxy.
I guess it was just a thought.
A creation of my own fancy.
And the next thing I knew, I...
Well, I excreted some sort of grey, malodorous substance all over my pants.
You're out of the woods.
You're out of the dark.
You're out of the night.
Step into the sun.
Step into the light.
Ooh.
Keep straight ahead.
More than this glorious place on the face of the earth.
Or the sky.
Ooh.
Hold onto your breath.
Hold onto your heart.
Hold onto your home.
March up to that gate and fill it open.
Open.
Open.
Speaking of swinging like a corpse of stink, did you get the email and hear about the dreams of, like, Toto with the space helmet?
And you haven't heard of a lick of a dream like that?
No.
Of dog sex with...
Judy Garland in the space... nothing like that.
The helmet and everything?
I had that.
I had... I didn't actually have the dream.
I had the actual sex.
The dog sex with Judy Garland.
So you were Toto in the space helmet.
Well, you knew your...
Well, actually, I was...
Can I say doing?
I was doing Toto and then Toto was doing Judy.
She was...
It was a little three-way thing.
It was fun.
Little is right.
Well, yeah.
I mean, it was...
I'm surprised to hear that about you, Bleepo.
Well, let me tell you, I mean, the dog was never the same after that.
Let's just say he had to wear a special little bag after that.
But I don't...
I'm not proud of that.
I use my dog as a special little bag.
I'm not proud of that, you know, because I'm not into animal abuse.
I like that one better.
I use the little dog as a special bag on the big dog.
Right.
I saw that.
I saw those dogs.
Those dogs are the funniest lawn ornaments I've ever seen.
I got to say that.
Well, especially when I turn the blood spray on.
Yeah, coming out of the derby hat.

I love that.
The first time I saw it, I thought it was like a Laurel and Hardy thing.
And then I...
I didn't do it.
Instead of chocolate, I thought it was like chocolate, but it was real blood.
I thought...
That was wacky.
You know, with the old film holograms with the dog thing with the nose and the chocolate.
It was just too...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.




I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, that's alright.


Get used to it.

That's okay.

Don't get emotional, Jimmy.
Jon Charlie!
I didn't do anything but notice there was somewhere for the chocolate top.
I was telling Tom Lewis it was really .

I actually feel an awesome personality when I'm not pizza-いました.
Yeah, completely.

The redesigned emotion is plates.

Oh, are you alive, darling?
Hey.

They are complete.
There's no clothes on the pleasure ships, is there?
If they want them, they grow them.
I guess it's with some of them newer models and stuff.
All you have to do is think of like maybe a nice pair of checkerboard pants with bell bottoms.
You could want them to not grow them and it would disappear.
It would be this endless cycle of them growing clothes and themselves willing the clothes and you willing not clothes.
I guess staying really did kind of help bring about a very awful world for all of us.
It's just this constant fluctuation.
Yeah, between a bunch of different minds wanting their different ego ideas of what they want, you know?
I am here to protect you.
You have nowhere to go.
You have nowhere to go.
You are a full believer.
Blessings of the state.
Blessings of the masses.
It could be hell.
Subgenius hell.
Subgenius hell.
There is no hell.
There's just endless, endless lines of more or less pleasure and a lot more pain all the time.
There is no heaven.
Really.
There is no hell.
There is no Bob.
Well, I happen to know there is a Bob because he's standing right over there.
He's sitting there smiling.
It's just like the smile on the dog's face.
What's the instinct to a dog?
To hunt.
To kill.
Master.
Hunt.
Hunt.
Hunt.


To hunt for the pack.
From all the tales of the West, we'll number best Corporal Rusty and Private Renton Timm.
Nobody has done this for them or to them.
They have done it to themselves.
They are a slave.
You know what it is?
In short, they are a slave.
They're a slavery.
They need to be free.
They need to be liberated.
They need to be liberated.

They need to be liberated.
You know.
You know.
Bob doesn't care.

He doesn't care whether you brush your teeth or whether you shave your legs or whether you...
Or whether your dad's the heat.
Yeah.
He doesn't care.
Bob doesn't care.
He doesn't care if you're packing a big old colostomy bag from a surprise you had somewhere in a hillbilly bar.
He doesn't care.
Or a .44 Magnum loaded with big hollow point bullets ready to...
No, sir.
As long as you got...
Take out Africa with one shot from this pleasure ship which can magnify the bullets to the size of the state of Oregon.
But since we're all into drumming, we wouldn't want to take out Africa with one shot.
We'd probably aim for Antarctica.
But I like penguins.
Ye who read are still among the living.
But I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows.
For indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known.
And many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen of men.
At the end of a rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend
And it has a story
Without any end
Unless we're so stupid as to destroy ourselves, there are going to be people exploring those worlds.
There are going to be human habitations on those worlds.
We're going to be moving out into space in the next century.
We're on a little time delay here.
We're broadcasting live from Brushwood and then it's airing just a few minutes later via the internet at WCSB in Cleveland.
And that's what's happening tonight.
Yep. And we're watching all kinds of people from many, many walks of life, every different type of...
They've kind of set up a little booth here for us, a little window booth like they do at the...
Big TV station.
Some people are going to hang around the Universal Date Line or the Invisible Date...
Yeah, which is actually going to be hovering right over the jam site for Saturday in the afternoon.
To allow the jammers and the other unfortunate ones...
Which consists of Einstein, Secret Orchestra, again, and whatever drummers show up.
We're going to be drumming for the Earth.
Saturday is going to be the last drumming to the Earth, the last...
We're going to bid farewell to the Earth Saturday afternoon.
At the...
With a happy, clappy, pounding sound.
The Greek Amphitheater in Brushwood.
We'll be singing the Strophe and the Anistrophe and we'll be performing Antigone in the afternoon.
But I don't think any of the players from the Iambic Chorus will be there.
Not the Baraka?
No.
Or the Coya Nascotzi?
No, those people will all be taken into Native American subterranean worlds to have their manicures and toes nails.
The life out of balance is about to be balanced.
Yep.
It had to happen someday.
And better that it happened someday than some other day.
Some day.
Some other day.
X day.
I still get gripped with...
Great five.
...plasms or spasms of fear.
And...
Thinking that...
Convulsions.
Well, I don't know if them ships is really going to be able to pull us up.
What if Stan gives us the Kool-Aid and...
Well, he pointed that out.
Yeah, he pointed it out.
You know, Stan could be a black-off guy trying to get a bunch of us, the subgeniuses, so that the, you know, the other bad guys...
Yeah, delivering us.
Right, to them.
Saying, here's the choice ones, chomp, chomp.
Or the pleasure ships might come down and they're the size of a mosquito.
Yeah.
And there they are hovering right in front of your face going, come on, get on, get on board.
Yeah, I...
And there we are, all paid up, dues paying members, and there's a little mosquito spaceship going, come on, let's go.
Well, that thought might have been precluded by the infinite worlds theory, wherein some...
There's a galaxy, supposedly.
A completely self-contained galaxy the size of a grain of sand.
And since this is possible, it is probably happening.
So therefore, there could be many, many, like Stan predicted also that...
I can't deal with the possible, it must be happening.
The possibilities?
Yeah, just so many of them.
I mean, who knows who's gonna show up the next day?
And they all happen.
Not just the little teeny bug craft.
Every thought that people have...
What if the big guys show up first and don't even see the planet?
You know what I mean?

You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, right, they're so big.
It's like they look at, where's the planet?
Yeah, where's Earth?
We're down here, man!
It's supposed to be here somewhere.
The charts say Earth's right here, and we'll be this tiny dust speck.
They won't even...
Yeah, and they...
Smaller than a mote of dust.
And they mistake it for like, you know, just a mote of dust.
Yeah.
They don't even see it.
They were expecting some big guys like them, you know.
Right, they don't even comprehend it.
Yeah, you're right, there we are down there, hey, we're down here!
And then right in the middle, you got the black-off guys trying to figure out who's gonna...
They want to get on there, see?
They want to make their own deal.
They want to get off on time and stuff.
You think a bunch of goons and spies who know this is gonna go on is gonna let it go on,
and they're not gonna get on there?
No, no, man.
Oh, the spooks are definitely here tonight.
Yeah, the spooks want to get all their people on there.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
A pure white race, probably, who knows?
And they think, yeah, they have to do all this other stuff, but all they have to do is become dues-paying members.
And that's it.
That's it.
They don't have to go around...
They don't have to get the jersey out of it.
Right, yeah.
They're spending...
Look at how much money they're spending in surveillance.
How many gray cars did you see on the edge of the campground this morning when all they had to do was just walk up to 30 bucks?
Blow three bucks.
Yeah, blow three bucks.
Have fun, meet a girl, smoke some frappie.
Yeah.
That's all it takes.
There's not much to it.
We're not, you know, talking rocket science here.
Well, we are, but not in any form that you would understand, so...
Don't worry about it.
Or even us, you know.
Really.
We don't know how this whole thing works.
Yeah.
You know, like I said before, I don't know how a great amount of this whole endeavor
is gonna happen, but I know my little part of it.
I know how to make my little part of this whole thing work, the whole rupture and all
that, and I guarantee you...
You won't fail because of me.
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.
Nothing like this has ever been exploded before, and we're gonna be pretty darn close.
I know you're leaving, babe, goodbye
So long I hope someday somebody listens to your song
Those bright lights never ever spelled your name
It's true Maybe a change of scene would be the best
for you
So long, babe
So long, babe
So long, zo之後
So long, babe.
So long, babe.
When in doubt, eat pussy.
So long, babe.
So long, babe.
So long, babe.
So long, babe.
So long, babe.
Well, I had no intention of sex.
Not with nobody, girl.
So long, babe.
I tried and I tried.
I will, I tried.
I was not the crazy man.
guitar solo
Well, I have no retention
I'm in another dimension
So
I do
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
at with what it's worth is with what it's worth.
Lob is not the end.
And meat is anything else.
Was it bad for you too?
There, it's a beginning.
The beginning was the end.
Talk about lobster meat for years.
Of everything, my friend.
That was a premature ejaculation, though.
I'll say.
It was before and after.
The ape regards his tail.
He's stuck on it.
Have I ever had multiple orgasms?
No, not in my recollection.
You will soon, my friend.
Very soon.
I want candy, lobster, I can roll.
I'm going to make sure there's control.
I'm going to make sure there's control.
I'm going to make sure there's control.
I'm going to make sure there's control.
All that stuff.
The real X-Day.
Behind the X-Day.
The sword of destiny.
It's kind of like the real Mardi Gras behind Mardi Gras.
Yeah.
Like who?
Who's the real Rex?
Where's the real magic happening?
Yeah.
It's not happening in a boneyard somewhere down on...
It's not happening in outer space.
On Rue d'Abelard.
The real magic doesn't happen in outer space, kids.
It happens in a little microcosmic world.
Inner space.
Magic.
Are you...
Let's speak to the Brushwood fans here.
Just randomly...
We're out there practicing their magic right now.
Let's just take...
Forget about the people in Cleveland.
Forget about the people in other parts of the world.
You want to pick us up here as we just roll along?
We'll just walk out there?
Yeah, all right.
Here, let's go.
Let's take the microphones.
What should we hit first?
You want to go where they're selling all the frock?
Or you want to go where they're selling...
The magic drums?
No, I want to go watch the magic.
Oh, there's people, I guess, off over by those blue tents.
Hey, have you seen Ivan Stang?
Hey.
Hey, you dressed in that white...
Gosh, look at that outfit.
It's like white polka dot.
The arms are 40 feet long.
That person's arms are 40 feet long.
Wow.
Look at that.
That's pretty cool.
Look at that chick over there.
The day glow paint all over her body.
Look at that, dude.
Nice little purple little things.
Look at that.
Over that way, there's this weird glow coming from just over the hill.
Let's follow the glow, man.
That's always, you know...
Let's put these mics down and not worry about this radio showing.
Look, it's getting bigger.
There she is, man.
The chick I was telling you about.
Oh, wow.
The one they were interrogating.
Wow, she's...
Wow, she's looking...
Look at how tall she is now, though.
Man, she's looking...
A 30-foot woman.
Man, one pill makes you smaller.
One pill makes you tall.
She took the tall pill.
I don't want to take no more of these pills.
We all took the small pills.
I took the...
I took all the pills.
Oh, man, what's going to happen to me?
You didn't eat the mushroom, too, did you?
Yeah, I took...
Name it, what'd they give me?
I took it all.
The hamburger, the mushrooms on the hamburger.
You just remember what the doormouse said.
You just remember what the doormouse said.



You just remember what the doormouse said.

What if the rockets don't come?
Don't worry, they're coming, all right.
Nothing's going to happen to spoil my plans, baby.
I figured it all out.
It's time we told you, son.
We're not going home.
This is where we'll live from now on.
But what about the rocket?
What about Ohio?
More of what they want will be wherever we are
because we'll want the same thing, too.
Welcome, Israel.
Welcome, Israel.
We have bliss this time instead of misery.
Exactly, my friend.
Dave has spoken.
The Jews have spoken.
Filippo has spoken.
Chaz has spoken.
Stang has spoken.
And we have spoken.
We have spoken.
This is the end.
And yet, perhaps the end is really a new beginning.
A new beginning for all of us.
Because at the end of the rainbow,
if we do it the same way we began,
then it'll all be simple.
Here we are at the end of the rainbow.
We'll have a chance to redo all of those things
that we weren't able to do before.
Each and every one of us.
We can get it right this time.
That's right.
You imagine what it's like to go back,
to make it all right again.
It'll be like doing third grade all over again,
only knowing everything that you know now.
No more knocks on the head.
No more kids picking on you.
Driving you down and making fun of you.
You will be as unto a god.
At the end of a river,
you'll have everything you want.
The water stops its flow.
At the end of a high sea,
there's no place you can go.
You're as close to a god as you will ever be.
Take me, love me,
be your own.
Be there then.
Be there now.
I want to thank everyone who led up to this.
Where's my mom?
I want to thank Reverend Stagg,
and Lee Poe Chow,
and Lee,
and everybody that...
We'll see y'all at the end of the river.
I'll see you on the flip-flop, man.
Goodbye, Dad.
Catch you on the saucer.
Open up, my friend.
I've been going that night.
You gotta think about it.
You were at the top of the fence.
You think you can lock me up?
I'm in doubt.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
I'm all yours now.
I know.
When I'm trying to find out,
it's because my Lord is using me.
It's a kind of trade-off for what I do.
Put it to my face.
You're a drunk, failed writer,
failed school teacher,
failed husband.
You cry in the dark.
You're sad and cry yourself in the dark.
I don't know what to say.
Just shut up, all right?
Just shut up.
Why not add bad father to the list
just by giving you permission for the trial?
And in return,
get a job.
No.
We're going to do something about it.
The Earth is finished.
We're going to blow up our rocket
and start all over.
See if we can't build a better world up here.
And then he lifted his eyes to the deep ocean sky
trying once more to see Earth
and the house he had always called home.
But Earth was too far away
and the house was now only a heap
of radioactive rubble.
Only one wall remained standing.
and within the wall a voice spoke again and again and again.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly
and spring herself when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone,
that we were gone, that we were gone.
The whole world is waiting, for this will decide the fate of civilization, all humanity.
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.
Attention please, four minutes to bomb time.
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times and think to yourself,
there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home,
there's no place like home.
Stars are my home, stars are my home, stars are my home.
The world of Dimension X.
A googolplex is just as far away from infinity as is one.
Well infinity, you don't want to argue with infinity.
One.
It's not a number, it's a state of consciousness.
Isn't it?
One.
Come on now, let's not try to think like three people.
Three dimensional beings.
What?
Let's try to think like two dimensional beings.
In a binary world.
Yes.
Let's just...
Ah, that's what it's called.
Getting stoned on sunshine, sunshine.
Yeah, but it's in.
Stacking it for us.
Getting to it naturally.
Now we can do the ring with your shiny voice.
We're going to a place you'll never remember.
We've seen a big fan of a poor man like me.
A good son gone on a great length skirt.
Life is such a trippy thing.
And I hope that this summer's good.
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.
Remembering.
Remember me, that's what I sing.
And life is such a trippy thing.
Remember me, that's what I sing.
I don't think your baby's your baby.
I don't think your baby's your baby.
I'm not a baby.
You're a baby.

It's another day.
It's another day.


To grow.

To look for it.
Look for it.
Watch the sky.
And in the waves of gel.
The waves of hot gel.
The waves of the molecules.
The wave of the molecules.
Atomic crushing gel.
Came down.
Out of our speech.
That's what we're doing.
One, one, one more, one more, one more, until it's tired, the entire planet is gone.
I had to change me.
I love the world I found.
I've got to fly my own sweet way.
I've got to fly my own sweet way.
Life is such a trippy thing.
Hello, hello.
Talking about it.
On Earth is a day that's worth remembering.
Each day on Earth is a day that's worth remembering.
Life is such a grueling thing.
Don't pity me.
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, a ding-a-ling, a ding-a-ling.
Life is such a trippy thing.
You're silly.
I didn't know you shaved down there.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's so fuzzy.
Well, kids.
Yeah?
I'm so glad we're so squeaky again.
Keep your head on top.
Bob didn't tell us it would end so squeaky.
You're back to the wind.
All right.
And you're back in the saddle.
The saddle.
The saddle.
You as close to a god as you'll ever be.
You're so close.
She brings to me.
Oh, it's so sweet.
The time I remember.
Thank you.
My ancestors.
I won't say.
You are close to the beginning.
Goodbye.
See you again.
Out here.
Out here.
I, Bob, and Tim.
It's so cold.
It's so cold.
I have to be in my fusion.
Out here.
Let me see.
Myisu.
Let me see.
Be quiet, constitution of the dead.
Be quiet when the war begins.
inhibited.
And always go back to the start.
You have to always hold me in your book.
My nightcare.
Wall is so long.


Need to have a shadow.
Ow!
Ow!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . any time history.
We're the champs.
We're the champs.
We're the champs.
And we're the champs.
