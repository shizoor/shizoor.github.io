1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
The friends are all arguing about who's abused themselves the most.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,720
They're trying to signal from the other side of the earth. It doesn't matter.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,220
But that's okay. You can't hear anything.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,220
We can't hear anything.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
There's nothing in these headphones.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,540
And we start the show over and over again.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,020
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,360
The Self Genius Hour of Swatch!

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Here come the sound effects.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,460
And we start the show over and over again.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,340
Over and over and over again!

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,680
668 hours of slack.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,920
That's how many of these I've had to deal with.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,860
You know what's been going on for almost, well, over 15 years?

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,280
Over 15 years of slack!

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,160
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,120
Sometimes it didn't seem like slack.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,360
But you know every time you lick a stamp, you're consuming a tenth of a calorie.

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
And you know a crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,280
Yet the ant can lift 50 times its own weight.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Can pull 30 times its own weight.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,060
And always falls over on its right side when intoxicated.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,340
Don't you wish you could be that...

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Consistent, dear friends.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,940
And I'm just going to go straight on into the tapes.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,300
The hours and hours and hours of Einstein's Secret Orchestra that I have stacked up here.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,320
Actually, we do a live show, you know, out of Cleveland.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,800
It's more live than this one.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,480
So we'll go live there for a while.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,640
Also, I'm going to finish off that Firesign Theater album.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,140
Give me immortality.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,300
Or give me death.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,840
I know that y'all are never going to go out and spend money on that thing.

35
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,580
But you really have to hear it.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,380
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,140
Proof that a great comedy troupe can bounce right back 20 years later.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,200
Just like they were in the first...

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,220
I think their new album is just as good as any of their classics.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Like, I think we're all bozos on this bus.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,480
And Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers.

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,240
Those are very highly recommended albums.

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,780
By the Firesign Theater.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,740
The music in the background, in this case, is Arnold Mathis.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Who used to send music tapes to the Hour of Slack a lot.

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Back when he finally put out a...

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
I guess he got a CD burner.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,580
Someday, I guess we'll all have to have CD burners.

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,640
Won't we, dear friends?

50
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm going to have to start sending this show out on CD.

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,760
Apparently.

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,880
Well, we age.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,620
We change.

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,760
And we grow.

55
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,540
Yes.

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,040
In fact, just thinking about it makes me grow even more.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
But, well...

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay, I said I wasn't going to talk on this dead show.

59
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,500
So let's go to the live show with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,860
Chaz Smith, the church cantor,

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,860
Princess Wiardo,

62
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,080
and probably Bleepo Abernathy and yours truly.

63
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,000
And God only knows what else we'll have.

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Murking and mucking around in there.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Praise old Bob.

66
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,420
I have found the entry for Earth.

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,540
Humanity.

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,420
Third from the sun.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,780
If you start down the dark path forever,

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,580
you will meet your destiny.

71
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,520
And soon you will.

72
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,720
Each person gets like Stang.

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
He gets more money out of it.

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,220
Ham, ham.

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,320
From all those deluded sick fools

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,420
who would actually send him thousands on thousands of dollars

77
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,900
to build up a staggy...

78
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,260
Hey, man.

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,520
We saved...

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,180
Each one of those people was saved from heaven's gate.

81
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,300
That's true.

82
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,100
We saved their lives for $30.

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Now they're working for peanuts down in Bolivia

84
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,920
for the rest of their lives.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,260
But, hey, what the hell about that part, right, Stangy Boy?

86
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,060
Hey, man, after the Y2K bug,

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,260
there ain't going to be much work for web designers,

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,700
but coffee bean pickers...

89
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:23,920
That's right.

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,500
...are going to be in hot, great demand.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,820
I enjoy working with you.

92
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,400
Yeah, I know.

93
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
There's going to be a lot in need for a lot of child labor.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,760
A child laborer and little tennis shoemakers and stuff.

95
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,260
I enjoy working with people.

96
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,880
Okay, I can agree that we need a certain degree of child labor.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,780
We certainly do need a certain degree of millions of millions of small children

98
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,820
that will do absolutely everything you want from them,

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
and you neither need to feed nor clothe them,

100
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,020
but just kick them once in a while.

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,860
I enjoy working with people.

102
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,580
But I don't think that you should be in the forefront.

103
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,900
In your current position now, the way you are right now...

104
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,800
I enjoy working with people.

105
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,320
...of pushing this.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,080
It wasn't as convoluted this time, and it's just stupid.

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,280
Well, dolphins or humans are of very little use to the church,

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,440
not even as workhorses.

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,340
I enjoy working with people.

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,860
Pansies, however.

112
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,820
Pansies?

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,920
Not the standard chimpanzee, but the bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,900
What?

115
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,540
That is a valuable friend.

116
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,200
A chimpanzee and individual chimpanzee is a valuable friend to a subgenius?

117
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,860
Well, we, the subgeniuses, should...

118
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,020
They're so much closer to our yeti brethren and sistren.

119
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,440
And we should protect those chimpanzees

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,540
and only allow them to be raised in the most benevolent medical experimentation facilities.

121
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,220
I enjoy working with chimpanzees.

122
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,860
They're really enlightened.

123
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
I enjoy working with chimpanzees.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,700
Well, Stan, you could probably...

125
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:53,700


126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,920
Make a videotape of one of those cute little chimps

127
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,400
and sell them to subgenii everywhere

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,660
as a kind of an artificial going-away-from-home-you-don't-need-it-right-now-but-perhaps-later

129
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,880
best friend.

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,680
No, I think it should be the other way around.

131
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,040
I think we should sell the subgeniuses to the chimpanzees.

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,020
Oh, jeez.

133
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,340
You can't really top that.

134
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,980
I mean, that's a win-win situation any way you look at it.

135
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,380
That's the beauty part right in the beauty part there, man.

136
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,140
We should follow the bonobos.

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Well, I don't really know how we could follow them.

138
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,680
They're not really good at it.

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,680


140
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,680


141
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,060
They're not going anywhere.

142
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,380
They're just standing around one place fondling each other.

143
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,840
I mean, that's not...

144
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,740
You can't follow anybody.

145
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,680
You can do it yourself.

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,040
Well, if you follow them quietly and get to know them real well,

147
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
they'll let you fondle them, too.

148
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,500
And you've done that.

149
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,460
That's the whole idea, man.

150
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,720
Why do you think we started this?

151
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
Go bonobo all the way, man.

152
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,580
I know you've had all kinds of really weird erotic experiences,

153
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,860
but I don't think I know...

154
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,120
Is that true that there was a video...

155
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,200
The bug sex.

156
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,020
It's ape sex, dude.

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,100
So you...

158
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,340
There's videos of that now?

159
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,860
You fondling a bonobo monkey?

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

161
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,780
There's videos of you out fondling a bonobo monkey right now?

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,920
A bonobo chimpanzee?

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,140
Dave, Dave, Dave, cool it, man.

164
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,360
But, you know...

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm cool with it as much as I can,

166
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,920
but I think the facts kind of are startling in themselves

167
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,760
that you would allow yourself to be physically used

168
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,620
by a member of another species.

169
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,020
Dave, Dave, Dave, this line is not exactly secure.

170
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,300
Well, I didn't think any of the lines were secure.

171
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,080
I thought they were all...

172
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,080


173
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,080


174
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,080


175
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,280
They were all open.

176
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,780
I thought they all went straight to Langley or wherever it is now.

177
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,300
I think it's in...

178
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,840
Oh, thank you.

179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,420
They go straight out over the Internet.

180
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,740
Oh, well, then that's...

181
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,920
Everything you just said is now part...

182
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,080
is now on deja vu news for the next 20 years.

183
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,140
I can't do that.

184
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,560
Thanks.

185
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,420
Now everybody's going to be looking for the videos of the ape sex,

186
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,900
trying to download that stuff.

187
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,240
Next thing you know,

188
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,600
Kenneth Starr is going to want to know all about it.

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,640
Now, exactly where did you get these chimpanzees?

190
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,600
You know, how much did you pay for them?

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
You know, did you...

192
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,780
Did you do it in the closet?

193
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,180
Did you ever do it backwards?

194
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,160
You did all that stuff, didn't you?

195
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,660
Like dogs.

196
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,620
You did all that stuff, didn't you?

197
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,060
And you were actually wearing the Bonobo semen strain...

198
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, I made up all that stuff.

199
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,340
I sat there and answered every question.

200
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,300
Oh, yeah, I did it.

201
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,980
I did everything.

202
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,260
You really didn't do any of it?

203
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,820
And they went, oh, thank you very much,

204
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,080
and, you know, sent me home.

205
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,140
But you really...

206
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,540
I told them just what they wanted to hear.

207
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,500
Yes, it's all true.

208
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Everything you...

209
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,340
Yes, the satanic cult.

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,960
Yes, abduction by aliens.

211
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,060
Yes, yes, child abuse.

212
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,760
Child abuse, it's all true.

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
But how much of it is true?

214
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,540
And they went, oh, oh, you're not going to,

215
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,600
you know, like, put up a stink or anything?

216
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,180
I was going to know.

217
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Well, putting up a stink is one of the best things you do,

218
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,640
isn't it?

219
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,360
I mean, you know, you've been known to let the wind

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,060
go around the land, you know?

221
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,400
Man, you put up a good stink.

222
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,900
They thought they were going to blackmail us.

223
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,860
Oh, okay.

224
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,700
Now it's going, look, look, we get...

225
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,360
They give us medals for this stuff.

226
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,180
Like, oh, I'm sorry we...

227
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,720
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.

228
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,880
You told us that because we were about to branch Davidi and you,

229
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,660
and we were about to mark Mount Carmel you, daddy-o.

230
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,360
They said that to you?

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah.

232
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,040
How did they transmit this?

233
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,000
Did they call you up or what?

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,160
It was an IRS audit.

235
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,340
They thought we were making millions and millions of dollars off of Bob,

236
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
and, you know, we were...

237
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,960
And we basically said, well, yeah, we are, but we paid our taxes,

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,680
and here's the proof.

239
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,580
And they went, oh, you really did pay your taxes.

240
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,360
We went, yeah.

241
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,900
They went, oh, well, continue with whatever.

242
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,060
We don't care what you do.

243
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,880
Look in that compound.

244
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,820
Huh.

245
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,120
Do whatever the hell you want.

246
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,780
That is...

247
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,000
That all seems like democracy.

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Torture, mind control.

249
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,320
Well, we do it.

250
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,580
Well, that's terrible.

251
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:31,980
We're the IRS.

252
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,760
We can do anything.

253
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,960
That's awful, man.

254
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,640
And then we went out and had a couple of prop sticks.

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,040
From space, it all seems like the squabbles of mites on a plum.

256
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,600
My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship,

257
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,820
so I am constantly occupied.

258
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,060
I am putting myself to the full...

259
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,020
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use,

260
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,800
which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

261
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,180
The best is yet to come.

262
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,700
Not now.

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,600
I can't take anymore.

264
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,460
I don't want anymore.

265
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,700
Can you imagine that?

266
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,680
Can you imagine when you're sleeping on the moon?

267
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,780
You know, like, that's got to be a trap.

268
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,380
Look, something big is going on here, and I don't have answers for it.

269
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,840
I don't know what's going on.

270
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,320
I keep trying to make an ass out of you and me,

271
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,380
but I keep coming to an assumption instead.

272
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,380
Yeah.

273
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,000
And it's the Church of the Incorrect Assumption.

274
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,900
Mm-hmm.

275
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,240
And it's the Church of the Incorrect Assumption.

276
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,960
So we have to start our own church.

277
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,300
This church called Christianity is 2,000 years old.

278
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,020
Who would want American culture?

279
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,440
Who would want to belong to a 2,000-year-old?

280
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,200
I mean, that's like having a 2,000-year-old chicken sandwich, man.

281
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,100
You know, you want your religion to be fresh, hot off the grill.

282
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,560
Absolutely.

283
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,840
Microwave for 32 seconds, exactly.

284
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,500
Yeah, I mean, that religion probably served those people well 2,000 years ago.

285
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,860
Yeah, think of why they walked around in sandals and green.

286
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,100
For their society and their part of the world that they lived, that worked for them.

287
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,620
But we've learned a lot since then.

288
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,840
Right, and you think of guys at chariot raids.

289
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,660
You think they're running and they're shooting each other with bow and arrows in their chariots as you're going, you know, and stuff.

290
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,500
No, man, we're...

291
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,220
Absolutely.

292
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,740
But what is Christianity?

293
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,120
Christianity is stupid.

294
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
Christianity is stupid.

295
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,400
Christianity is stupid.

296
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,000
Christianity is stupid.

297
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,140
Communism is good.

298
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,400
Christianity is stupid.

299
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,060
Communism is good.

300
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
Christianity sucks.

301
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,560
Communism rules.

302
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,920
Communism is good.

303
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Communism is good.

304
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,720
Freeze your synapses in your cerebral cortex.

305
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
We'll rebel.

306
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,060
We'll rebel and leave the party.

307
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,460
Yep.

308
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,520
They'll leave the party.

309
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,240
We have to be what we are.

310
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,980
Not what the Father tried to make us.

311
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,400
Who are you?

312
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,440
Who are you?

313
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,320
Who are you?

314
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,420
Who are you?

315
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Who are you?

316
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,920
Who are you?

317
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,400
Who are you?

318
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,400


319
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:11,520
And now, it's time to get on the phone and talk with Radio Now's Dr. Onan Winkydink, author of the international bestselling self-help manual, Sex With My Hat.

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,400
The doctor is in.

321
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,180
Hello?

322
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Why look, it's me.

323
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,300
And I'm Dr. Winkydink, an old hand that self-loves.

324
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,080
So what are people thinking about on the last night of the so-called last day?

325
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,180
I know what I'm thinking about.

326
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm thinking about me.

327
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,900
And I have the right to do that.

328
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,820
See, it's my gift to me.

329
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,980
It's my party to myself.

330
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,700
And I've got my party hat on, and you know what I like to do in my hat.

331
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,600
Well, let's go to the phones.

332
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,600
It's a chump in a booth.

333
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,160
Hello, chump.

334
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,480
You're a self-serving a-hole, you know that?

335
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,540
So you'd like to talk about my body parts.

336
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,380
I wonder how I feel about that.

337
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,000
Who cares? I'm locked in.

338
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,900
Well, we're all locked in, but you hold the key.

339
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,960
No, I don't cream for brains.

340
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,380
It's locked from the outside.

341
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
Ah, prisoner of your own body armor.

342
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,640
Oh, stop the psycho babble, winky shrink.

343
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,120
Oh, this sucks.

344
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,060
Sucking is good, too.

345
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,640
I can hear chump being jealous of my winky, and I suppose that makes him angry.

346
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
But I know how you feel.

347
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
Sometimes it's too much for me.

348
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,420
Dink, dink.

349
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,400
It's me, the chumpster.

350
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,500
It's no way to talk about ourselves.

351
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Only the chumpster within talks like that.

352
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,920
You ignorant piss-ass!

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
Let me out of this box!

354
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,040
I only have the power, though, to get out of my own box.

355
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a beautiful box, wrapped up with a big red ribbon,

356
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,880
and I give it to myself every day.

357
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,660
In fact, I'm giving it to myself right now.

358
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,120
Shut your ignorant piehole, you insufferable wanker!

359
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,940
Look, I'm across the wall, all here waving at you, see?

360
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,340
Look, get your head out of your lap and look up!

361
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't you get it?

362
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,660
I've been locked in this booth by the guys with the eyeball hats!

363
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,940
Ah.

364
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,440
You know, I've been waiting for this for years.

365
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,840
Real mental illness.

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
You bastard, I'm coming to get you!

367
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,120
Where's that chair?

368
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,220
Yes!

369
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,420
Man, what was that?

370
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,340
Is the station on the air?

371
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,120
All right, I'm bebop.

372
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,420
Fellas, excuse me, there's some fast-breaking news

373
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,240
happening right out there in the hallway.

374
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:06,780
Right.

375
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,880
Chump is just knocking the whiz off of that Dr. Winky guy.

376
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,960
Man, you're kidding!

377
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Oh, look at this funny hat I found.

378
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
It's covered with eyeball...

379
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,080
Oh, that's spooky, man.

380
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,520
Hey, is that champagne?

381
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,220
Yeah.

382
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,440
Are you gonna finish that steak?

383
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,260
Well, you can have part of it, man, but...

384
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm gonna scrape the mushrooms off.

385
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm alone.

386
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Those aren't mushrooms, man.

387
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,600
Those are white truffles!

388
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,800
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

389
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,160
Kill me.

390
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,580
Guys, it's New Year's Eve, but we're still a radio station.

391
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,260
Uh, yeah.

392
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,820
Go back on the air.

393
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,400
Let's go to a public service announcement.

394
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,140
What do we got here?

395
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,300
Oh, man, those are so dull.

396
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,040
Can't we have...

397
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,220
Lying lame.

398
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,060
Victims of incense.

399
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,260
I gotta go home.

400
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,720
Verdict and challenge.

401
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
I could read some poetry.

402
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,660
Go to the lottery.

403
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,280
The lottery is the people.

404
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,920
The people taking a last chance on themselves.

405
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,440
So why shouldn't people just like you

406
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,580
spend the next century stuffed with truffles?

407
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,920
Like lucky tin can opener Juan LaFond.

408
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,000
I won!

409
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,480
Now I don't have to work on this finger-cutting machine no more.

410
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,560
Whoops.

411
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,880
Or itch-and-sniff winner Mrs. Manila Anvilope.

412
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,140
Finally, I can afford to pay someone to kill my husband.

413
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,560
And the loser's money goes to our schools

414
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,960
for embedding mental detectors in our kids

415
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,580
and to our prisons

416
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,440
so they can have Sadie Hawkins Day.

417
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Lottery luck.

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,700
It's only a buck away.

419
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,520
Triple ripoff, millennial snatch and lick.

420
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,520
It's rolled over to 180 billion dollars.

421
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,820
Drawings at midnight.

422
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,020
So if anybody still has a chance,

423
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,680
it must be you.

424
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,420
Radio Now.

425
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,540
Not now, you're dead meat.

426
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,020
Hey, John.

427
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,580
The shot in Dallas was being crossed.

428
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,680
The man caught me caught under the gateway to the trees.

429
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,420
The great man of the day.

430
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,420


431
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,420


432
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,760
The great man of the day.

433
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


434
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


435
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


436
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


437
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,460
They're behind the plan to make us marry our toaster.

438
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,880
The one that fosters this muscle.

439
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,560
It's in the jar at the White House with yellowing sparks.

440
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,180
The great sea didn't put electricity in my toothpaste.

441
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
Someone on the Supreme Court's a woman,

442
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,840
and it's not the one you think.

443
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,700
The angels on the asteroids are abducted across the forest.

444
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,200
It's not coming to an end.

445
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,300
Corsi de la Rida.

446
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,280
It's 11.05.30, high time for a bright light to pierce the conspiratorial darkness.

447
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,480
No, I'm not afraid to talk about it, so don't come up on me.

448
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm Harold Hippogor with Night Whispers.

449
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,780
Night Whispers.

450
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,280
Good evening.

451
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,740
I'm here beneath the biggest party of the millennium under the stands at Homeless Stadium.

452
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,920
And it's time for Fun Fun Town's most controversial radio broadcast.

453
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,020
And my only guest tonight, well, I suppose I'm actually his guest,

454
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,120
General Y2K, commander of the Last Minute Men.

455
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,160
Y2K, that's not your real name, is it, Mildew?

456
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,020
These are the last minutes of the last hours of the last century, Hippogor.

457
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,560
The countdown for liberty has begun.

458
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,720
And before the nameless face of the world,

459
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,060
the new world order can pull the switch, I'm pulling it.

460
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,740
Well, that's fascinating, General.

461
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,140
I was napping poolside at the Gulf War swim drone

462
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,300
when the government put a chip in my ass.

463
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,980
And I'm not going to take it sitting down.

464
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,920
It's high noon daylight slavery time.

465
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,980
And as of now, you're taking orders from us.

466
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,040
And that means me.

467
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,220
Well, you hold right onto that thought, General,

468
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,900
because I've got some ant farms to sell here.

469
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,080
As you know, dear friends,

470
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,560
these DOA ant farms,

471
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,580
are a lot safer than these scorpion survival yo-yos

472
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,540
we offered last week.

473
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,120
What the hell's a survival yo-yo?

474
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,300
They've got a little compass in them.

475
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,820
They got a knife?

476
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,840
No, no, if you want a knife,

477
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,640
that's the Swiss Army Scorpion Survival Yo-Yo.

478
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,840
You're giving me a brain cramp.

479
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,060
Anyway, dear friends,

480
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,880
these ant farms are an easy-care miracle.

481
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,120
No food, no water required,

482
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,720
because all these little monsters are dead on arrival

483
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,480
under the sand at the bottom of the box.

484
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Just send $29.99 gold or silver coin only

485
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,260
to post office box

486
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,700
I-10.

487
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,620
I-210-0.

488
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,360
Donkey Dump, Utah.

489
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,720
So, General Waituki,

490
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,580
you're giving the orders, you say?

491
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,480
Right. One.

492
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,920
I want to order one of those ant farms.

493
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
We don't have to do that. I'll give you this one.

494
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay. Two.

495
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,980
No, I can only give you the one because it's a sample.

496
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,920
No, no, no. Then B, B.

497
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,880
All washing machines, rice cookers, bread makers,

498
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,940
coffee makers, chainsaws, and dust suckers

499
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,400
are to be destroyed.

500
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,400
Chainsaws? No.

501
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,080
Well, not chainsaws, but everything else.

502
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,360
Well, tell us why,

503
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,160
can you, General?

504
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,640
They're all time-saving devices, aren't they?

505
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,640
And who's getting the time they're saving?

506
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
You know, I think action speaks louder than words.

507
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Lights up.

508
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,140
All right, men.

509
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,840
Let's massacre those Mr. Coffees.

510
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,900
Now, now we'll make off to the old cowboy way.

511
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,880
Boil it up in your hat.

512
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,080
What was the point of that, General?

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,820
You don't know from Doodly Squad, do you, Puke?

514
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,120
What?

515
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,600
You know, we're not going to be able to get out

516
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:06,800
of this place without you.

517
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,260
We're going to have to get out of this place

518
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,260


519
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,260


520
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,260


521
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,820
Save the enemy.

522
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,600
Three minutes a day.

523
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,560
We just took back 150 minutes,

524
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,860
and that doesn't suck!

525
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,020
It took them back from who?

526
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,760
From whom?

527
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,000
The maggots in the eyeball hats.

528
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,620
My men!

529
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,140
No, no, no.

530
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,940
Those eyeball hats are a novelty item.

531
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've got a very good deal on them

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,280
coming up later in the show tonight.

533
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,660
Negatory now.

534
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,020
My men torched the eyeball warehouse this morning.

535
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,180
We nuked them till they glowed

536
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,240
and shot them in the dark!

537
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,800
Oh, no.

538
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,480
All my tax records were in that warehouse.

539
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
Look, let's just go to the phones.

540
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,840
Hal, Hal, put a hold on the phones.

541
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,340
That General's as buggy as a bum's blanket.

542
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm pulling you out of there pronto now.

543
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,780
Yeah, come on, Hal, man.

544
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
Get back to the station.

545
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,960
Ray's got some bubbly.

546
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,760
Be good for your nose.

547
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,440
Get out of there.

548
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,100
Thank God.

549
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,880
The microphone is all yours, General.

550
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
Hey, hey, where are you going, Mr. Highball?

551
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,020
I'm going to turn up your volume out in the truck.

552
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,620
I don't want to say that that kid sucks,

553
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,240
but he certainly inhales deeply.

554
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,920
All right, men!

555
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,000
Light up the deck, sucker!

556
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,580
Noose this way.

557
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,960
On this crazy night.

558
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,320
I am Bebop Lobo, baby, the night wolf.

559
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm Radio Bebop.

560
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,020
I am Radio 2000.

561
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,960
I am the voice of the future.

562
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,040
I am the voice of the past.

563
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,660
I am the memory.

564
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,180
Mm-hmm, that last.

565
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,100
All right, fun, fun town.

566
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
Get ready for the countdown.

567
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,460
Bebop, Bebop, before we turn over the zero,

568
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,480
answer me this.

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,800
Yeah?

570
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,520
How come you talk like you do?

571
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,520
What do you mean, the way I talk the way I do?

572
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,380
I'm speaking Spanish.

573
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,900
Where do they speak Spanish like that?

574
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,520
L.A., that's where I'm from.

575
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,180
Hey, Mr. Producer, I'm tired of calling you that.

576
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,880
Now, do you have an actual name?

577
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,540
Yeah, my name is Dwayne.

578
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,600
All right, Dwayne.

579
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,200
Hey, I don't have much champagne here.

580
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,320
You got anything in there?

581
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,540
Yeah, I'm nursing two magnums with the orange widow.

582
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,980
Whoa, how'd you do that?

583
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,260
Executive leverage.

584
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,540
And a jimmy stick for the honor box.

585
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Uh, fellas, bulletin.

586
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,200
I've been monitoring the big to-do

587
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,660
at Holder's Stadium on our website.

588
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,100
Whoa.

589
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
And there's been some real news.

590
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,680
Oh, my God, you mean the news drought has broken.

591
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,920
The groomed domedary Joe Camel, beloved ex-icon,

592
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,880
has humped his way onto the stage

593
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,020
and seems to be delivering a farewell address to the nation.

594
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,120
All right, I'm gonna throw us to the camp right now.

595
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,840
No, I'm no longer a hero.

596
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm not gonna make it through the eye of the zero,

597
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,120
so just say goodbye to me.

598
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,740
Say goodbye to the whole damn 20th century

599
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,700
when a man could die.

600
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,500
Drive 140 right over the edge.

601
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,480
So could a camel.

602
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,860
You'd have your top down and your shades up

603
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,300
sucking gas and sugar out of a little icy green bottle

604
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,560
burning a nail strong enough to blow you down over the border.

605
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,980
And a Barbie beside you

606
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,880
who throws away the lettuce and eats the burger.

607
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Goodbye to all that.

608
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Bye-bye to me.

609
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,000
Bye-bye.

610
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,500
Bye-bye.

611
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


612
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


613
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


614
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


615
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


616
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


617
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


618
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


619
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


620
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


621
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


622
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,700


623
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:35,700
Bye-bye.

624
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,400
Bye-bye.

625
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


627
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


629
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


630
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


631
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


632
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


633
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Kind of.

634
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,880
We're U.S. Plus.

635
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,360
We own the idea of the idea of America.

636
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,660
It's not easy to follow a camel,

637
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,360
but you know me.

638
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,400
I'm the chumpster,

639
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
but I'm a new man.

640
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,280
I'm leaving the old me in the old centuries

641
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,400
and taking a new chump into the new millennium.

642
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,420
Why?

643
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,380
Well, the eyeball hat I'm wearing,

644
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,560
I'm not gonna give it away.

645
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,200
It's got eyeballs all around.

646
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,860
I see the past.

647
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,580
I see the present.

648
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,360
And I can eyeball the future.

649
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,640
If I'm gonna make it,

650
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,980
I have to come to terms with what's been eating me up.

651
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,540
I've been betting on my own kids' games.

652
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,300
I bet on them tonight.

653
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,320
And they got pork.

654
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,800
No more.

655
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:33,960
No more.

656
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,340
No more.

657
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


658
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


659
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


660
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


661
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


662
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


663
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


664
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,680


665
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,480
I'll make this promise even if it breaks me.

666
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,020
From now on, I resolve that if my kid is playing a team

667
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,080
that's gonna punk them,

668
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,480
then I'm going with the winner.

669
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,180
If you don't play the odds,

670
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,540
you'll have nothing left to give your kids

671
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,180
when it's all over.

672
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,280
And I'm out.

673
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Ooh, the chump boy.

674
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
He's got an eyeball on us.

675
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,180
Who would have thought a chump,

676
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,420
he turns over a new leaf just before it's too late.

677
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,500
Hope Dr.

678
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,400
Pinky will be pleased.

679
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
I tell you what, I'll go down to the dick man's room in the hospital

680
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,620
and tap out the message on his cat.

681
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,740
Ha ha ha ha.

682
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,680
All right, you're in the countdown to destiny, champagne.

683
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,580
Flowing all over Fun Fun Town, champagne.

684
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,060
Flowing all over the studio, frankly.

685
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Let's get us another perspective high up in the frozen air.

686
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,220
We got Captain Happy Bandit in the now chopper.

687
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,760
Roger, beepster, I picked up the merchandise

688
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,160
and we're flying high with my new co-pilot, Sergeant Vanilla.

689
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,820
Whoa!

690
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,920
Whoa!

691
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,080
Don't fall out the door, Danny.

692
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,120
No, I'm holding on.

693
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,780
And the snow is billin' around the chopper door out there

694
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,600
like a crowd of sparkling superstars

695
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,940
waiting for their 15 minutes of fame before they melt.

696
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
Hey, we haven't even got 15 minutes left, Danny.

697
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,100
Roger, people, we're on top of the homeless now.

698
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,160
And I'm gonna be tossing these gorgeous little princess goddess

699
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,940
talking pocket dolls out by the handful way down there

700
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,980
to the children of disprivileged hopefuls from all over now in our town.

701
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,620
Is that a goddess?

702
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the first box of dolls, Captain.

703
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,480
Box of dolls?

704
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,060
It's only one of them, Danny.

705
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,780
It's a doll drop.

706
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
Remember, one doll, one drop.

707
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,740
I love you, Danny.

708
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,240
Wait.

709
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,420
You're gonna drop her?

710
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,780
Oh, no, no.

711
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,060
You can't do that.

712
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,560
Take us down, Happy.

713
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,720
Oh, bless him.

714
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,780
Did you see that?

715
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,380
This is it, Danny.

716
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,720
Charlie's got a fix on his hand company.

717
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,180
We gotta light the load.

718
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,360
Captain Morgan's dead.

719
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,600
And I'm sure he just got a little bit of a hangover.

720
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,600


721
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,600


722
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,600


723
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,600


724
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,600


725
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,860
We gotta go.

726
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,220
Push her out.

727
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,160
No, no.

728
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,140
Do it, soldier.

729
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,140
That's an order.

730
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,020
I'm flying.

731
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,680
Sure.

732
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,360
Okay, I will.

733
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,920
Take my hand.

734
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,320
Hello.

735
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,480
Don't worry.

736
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,020
We're camels in the wind.

737
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,860
It's a hundred ticks to the ground.

738
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,860
They ought to get back with some lucky found thing in a box.

739
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,460
Hold it.

740
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,100
Hold it.

741
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,420
Happy New Year, Happy.

742
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,720
They're flying.

743
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,460
I got wings.

744
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,580
I got wings.

745
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


746
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


747
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


748
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


749
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


750
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


751
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


752
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


753
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


754
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


755
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,580


756
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh, my gosh.

757
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,120
They're heading straight for the golden sunny of the left side of Midnight.

758
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,540
That's gotta be a happy ending.

759
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,500
We're at minus 16, Captain.

760
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm heading home.

761
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,080
Home.

762
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,800
My goodness.

763
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,260
Man, that sounds like a good idea, huh, Ray?

764
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,080
That's what I was gonna say.

765
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,680
Why don't we wind this thing down, Duane?

766
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,140
Let's go home.

767
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,360
You mean get down and shut it down?

768
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,980
That's right.

769
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,520
Let's say goodbye to the whole thing.

770
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,080
Well, you know, I'd rather, gentlemen, I'd feel rather at a loss not being able to say

771
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,680
goodbye with my dear partner.

772
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,520
Then there he is.

773
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,760
Speak of the devil.

774
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,520
Come on in.

775
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,540
I hope I'm back in time.

776
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,040
Perfect.

777
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,120
Your timing is perfect.

778
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,100
Get some champagne.

779
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,300
I couldn't see the street.

780
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,320
I parked the van on the sidewalk.

781
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,360
It must have been terrifying.

782
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,460
We'd be saying goodbye, Hal.

783
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,720
Yes, goodbye.

784
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,360
We'd be saying goodbye to the old millennium, for instance, the old silly old century.

785
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:03,960
Oh, yeah.

786
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


787
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


788
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


789
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


790
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


791
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


792
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


793
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:03,960


794
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,100
Well, I think it must be time to say goodbye to closets.

795
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,580
Oh, yes.

796
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,640
Everybody's out of them.

797
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
Well, all right.

798
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,120
Say goodbye to a bunch of guys named Bill.

799
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,900
Yes, yes.

800
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,740
All the moderns, the romantics.

801
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
The prosperous.

802
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,940
The depressed.

803
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,720
Goodbye to the war lovers.

804
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,200
Here, here.

805
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,360
Say goodbye to manual typewriters.

806
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,300
And don't say it.

807
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,260
He was not my uncle.

808
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,060
Bye-bye, Freud.

809
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,220
Communism.

810
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,040
Peace and quiet.

811
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
Hotel keys.

812
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,360
Cigarettes after sex.

813
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,340
Oh, cigarettes.

814
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,600
Sex?

815
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:33,880
Yes.

816
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:33,960
Cigarettes after sex.

817
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:33,960


818
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:33,960


819
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,540
Privacy.

820
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,080
Say goodbye.

821
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,300
Goodbye to 19 anything.

822
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,820
And finally, goodbye to good old death.

823
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,780
Yes, yes.

824
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,020
And those really comfortable old Lincoln Town cars.

825
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,380
Say goodbye to Zoot.

826
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,800
Clocks with hands.

827
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,480
Dumb damn.

828
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,620
Animal cruelty.

829
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,340
The funky chicken.

830
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,200
Get down.

831
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,920
Hey, if you're saying hello, say hello to smart furniture.

832
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,520
Yes, and intense demonic activity.

833
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,860
Here's to the new world.

834
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:03,940
Bye.

835
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,140
Good order.

836
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,160
Unfortunately, global warming.

837
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,400
A million, 100 year old.

838
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,380
Keep them out.

839
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,720
The virtual office.

840
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Smart agents.

841
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,280
Bots and viruses.

842
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,980
Digital bell models.

843
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,360
Aluminum radio hats.

844
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,200
Yes, and kid proof prison.

845
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:19,900
Oh.

846
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,940
And above all, say hello to the unknown.

847
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,140
The unknown.

848
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,160
To the unknown.

849
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,420
I'll drink to that.

850
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,200
Here's to it.

851
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,760
No drink to anything.

852
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,240
Ha, ha, ha.

853
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,940
The unknown.

854
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


855
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


856
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


857
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


858
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


859
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


860
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


861
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


862
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


863
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


864
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:33,940


865
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, all right, I'll try that.

866
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,720
All right, here he goes.

867
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
Let's drink to the unknown.

868
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,100
Try something else.

869
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,340
Mm.

870
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,640
That carry.

871
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,640


872
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,700
Black glasses?

873
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,180
That headless think you've given me to kill the night before.

874
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,520
The black calm up.

875
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
Cyanons?

876
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,480
The word balance?

877
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,020
Why the room tone?

878
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,220
Usare Avengers.

879
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:03,900
How strong?

880
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
thousand years.

881
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,120
Radio Now is owned and operated by

882
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,140
the North American franchise of

883
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,420
the Firesign Theater,

884
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,220
a plausibly deniable division of

885
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,900
U.S. Plus.

886
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,040
We own the idea

887
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,340
of now.

888
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,740
Okay, honey,

889
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm coming home.

890
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
The Firesign Theater,

891
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,040
dear friends,

892
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,600
and that's why I say

893
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,160
dear friends.

894
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,340
They had a radio

895
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,120
show many, many, many years

896
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,340
ago on which

897
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,320
they, too, would open

898
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,180
the show like a religious show,

899
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,060
although it wasn't really one

900
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,880
like this one really is, but they

901
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,040
always opened it with

902
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,880
a sort of a dear friends

903
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,180
thing, and that's why I say that so

904
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
much. It's a tip of the hat to

905
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,140
those inspirational

906
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,700
things.

907
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,420
Theatrical producers of

908
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,520
audio food.

909
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,580
And now

910
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,600
this.

911
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,780
The great and powerful

912
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,280
Oz knows why

913
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,380
you have come.

914
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,300
Good God.

915
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,100
Good God.

916
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,260
Good God.

917
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,460
Good God.

918
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,100
Good God.

919
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,420
My synapses have left the party.

920
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,500
To come is to believe.

921
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,560
I believe that you're gonna make it.

922
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,840
You're gonna be okay.

923
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,660
I really believe you are a lazy, good-for-nothing kid.

924
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm so commercial I could die.

925
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
Even a scientist has to admit

926
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,040
that there are some pretty serious

927
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,500
religious overtones to all this.

928
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
Let's hear from someone whose

929
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,760
organization has been accused of conducting

930
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,580
its own inquisition in recent days.

931
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,440
If you come, you believe.

932
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,960
To come is to believe.

933
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,860
That decision seems so bash-ackwards to me.

934
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,560
It seems if you were going somewhere,

935
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,640
you would have already been there.

936
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,360
How could you even know if you believed it or not?

937
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,560
Just as I am.

938
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,240
I think you're tripping out, Dave.

939
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,700
Looking at the earth.

940
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,220
Slide into fusion.

941
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,560
Slide into fusion.

942
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,060
Beyond life.

943
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,680
Join their culture.

944
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,600
But don't dominate it.

945
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm trying to hang in there, I guess.

946
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm in my mid-forties.

947
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,500
Basically, I am just so lonely.

948
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,380
And I have prayed and prayed

949
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,080
and prayed and prayed

950
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,300
and prayed and prayed

951
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,200
and prayed and prayed.

952
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,540
And prayed and prayed and prayed.

953
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,080
I just don't know how long I can go on with it.

954
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,680
I just can't understand why nothing ever happened.

955
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm not the best communicator that there ever was.

956
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,040
Well, I'm involved at church.

957
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,920
I sing in the church choir.

958
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,500
I'm lonely. I'm divorced.

959
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,840
I want somebody in my life.

960
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
I don't really know anything.

961
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,100
You're going to have to find some,

962
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,460
get some effort to get out and do something.

963
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,900
Get involved with some people.

964
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,340
So that's what I would suggest that you do.

965
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,640
Now it's up to you whether you're going to want to do that.

966
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,220
But sitting and waiting and just praying that God brings somebody here

967
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,880
is really not going to do it for you.

968
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,480
I have the gray hand.

969
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,640
I have the gray hand.

970
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,420
We have the gray hand.

971
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,100
Drop all your guns near the post office.

972
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Do you have the gray hand?

973
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,180
We have the gray hand.

974
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,460
If you feel you are not properly sedated,

975
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,220
then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times

976
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,120
and think to yourself,

977
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,620
there's no place like home.

978
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,880
There's no place like home.

979
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,480
There's no place like home.

980
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,080
As you're sitting around the Frop Fire,

981
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,380
you know, think about it.

982
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,900
Think about 30 years ago, that magical time.

983
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,140
Put yourself around the moon.

984
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,140
Put yourself in the driver's seat of the Moon Billy Cadillac.

985
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,460
Want to take a ride?

986
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:26,980
And then send all your money to Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

987
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Dallas, Texas 753.

988
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:42,060
Or call 888-669-2323.

989
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,320
We take plastic.

990
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:55,440
And remember, friends, that's slack at subgenius.com.

991
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,880
We take plastic.

992
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:00,880


993
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:00,880


994
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,200
We keep the DNA scattered all over the place.

995
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,940
Not just in level C or level T or level X.

996
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,680
As Jim Jones said,

997
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,420
I plant my seed in many places.

998
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,260
I've got big plans. Big, big plans.

999
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,480
Big plans.

1000
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,200
Big plans.

1001
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,740
That's right. Big plans.

1002
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,540
You don't know who I am or what I am.

1003
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,440
Come July 5th.

1004
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,920
But I've got big plans. Big, big plans.

1005
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,160
Who's got to take the joke this coming?

1006
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,180
July 5th.

1007
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,780
What?

1008
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,520
Whose turn is it?

1009
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,540
The Lord is on the mount to speak again.

1010
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,280
The Lord is going to speak?

1011
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,360
Do you have a prophecy?

1012
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,060
Hey, hey. Are you there?

1013
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,700
Yes.

1014
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,020
Yes.

1015
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,420
We're trying to think up of...

1016
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,140
Welcome, Jesus.

1017
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,080
What are we doing? New Year's...

1018
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,960
Oh, New Year's. We need a New Year's resolution.

1019
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,520
We were thinking also that...

1020
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,720
New Year's revolution.

1021
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,760
New Year's revolution. Exactly.

1022
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,840
Revolution 99.

1023
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,640
We were thinking that as subgeniuses,

1024
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,480
each year we should take on a new vice.

1025
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,900
Revolution 99.

1026
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,360
99.

1027
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,940
Revolution 99.

1028
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,580
Number 9.

1029
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,540
Number 99.

1030
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,280
So do you have a New Year's vice?

1031
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,400
Turn me on.

1032
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,040
When I'm going to adopt?

1033
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,240
What's that?

1034
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,780
You have to adopt a new vice?

1035
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,980
You have to get a new vice.

1036
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,440
Since most people have New Year's resolutions,

1037
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,860
you've got to pick up, you know, like greed.

1038
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,800
Yeah, right.

1039
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,920
Or sloth.

1040
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,940
Yeah.

1041
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,280
My New Year's vice resolution, my new vice will be...

1042
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,400
Oh, gosh. I have so many already.

1043
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,900
Well, you've got to pick up one more.

1044
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,520
See, that's the thing.

1045
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,600
When you get with subgeniuses like ourselves,

1046
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,620
since we do almost everything wrong,

1047
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,800
it's almost hard to come up with something new.

1048
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,240
I promise to do more psychotropics when I get the opportunity.

1049
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:53,900
There you go.

1050
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,460
All right.

1051
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,460
Wow. Can I be a copycat?

1052
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,080
I promise to be...

1053
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,000
That's such an excellent, excellent one.

1054
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,720
Okay.

1055
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,940
What's Michelle's?

1056
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,720
No, that was Princess Wee.

1057
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,680
Oh, Princess Wee.

1058
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,020
How you doing?

1059
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,080
It's real hard to hear with everybody talking.

1060
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,080
Oh, I can imagine.

1061
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,640
There's a wild party going on.

1062
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,060
It's an incredibly insane...

1063
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,680
Hey, Michelle, come here.

1064
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,840
I haven't seen my pants for over two hours.

1065
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,680
What's your vice, Princess Wee?

1066
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,140
You have to adopt a new vice.

1067
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,560
For the New Year, you have to have a vice.

1068
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,940
Oh, I'm the checkmate.

1069
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,360
She says no.

1070
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,060
I'm the checkmate.

1071
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1072
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1073
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1074
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1075
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1076
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1077
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,060


1078
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,700
I think Chaz's is so wonderful, I asked if I could copy.

1079
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,720
What was that?

1080
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
I want to copy Chaz's.

1081
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,500
You want to...

1082
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,700
Oh, you can do that.

1083
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
There's a vice right there.

1084
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,600
Copy.

1085
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,180
Copy.

1086
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,760
You're going to copy people more.

1087
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,620
Yes.

1088
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,200
Yeah.

1089
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,340
I don't know.

1090
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,860
I haven't come up with one yet.

1091
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,240
I don't know.

1092
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,880
I'm going to try to be more annoying, even more annoying than I am now.

1093
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,040
At any one given moment, I'll try to be more annoying towards all the people.

1094
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,040


1095
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,840
All my fellow humans.

1096
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,440
That's a noble aspiration.

1097
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,440
Yeah.

1098
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,300
I'll try anyway.

1099
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,360
So...

1100
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Oh, and wait.

1101
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,260
Did you...

1102
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,520
Did anybody else have a vice?

1103
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,540
Gordon, what's your vice?

1104
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,680
Your vice for the New Year?

1105
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,080
My vice for the New Year is...

1106
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,380
Happy New Year!

1107
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,680
Happy New Year.

1108
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,040
Duh.

1109
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,760
Yeah.

1110
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,400
Well, I...

1111
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,740
Hey, well, put...

1112
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,200
Do you have any prophecies or anything for this year?

1113
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,260
Oh, that's right.

1114
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,960
Jesus.

1115
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,480
Right.

1116
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,180
Prophecies.

1117
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:24,980
I...

1118
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,100
I...

1119
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,020
Prophecies.

1120
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,020


1121
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,020


1122
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,020


1123
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,020


1124
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,020


1125
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,700
I prophesize that the world will end this year as is predicted.

1126
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
What is it again?

1127
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:35,740
July?

1128
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,100
July 5th.

1129
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,480
July 5th.

1130
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:38,820
7 a.m.

1131
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,820
1999.

1132
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,540
1999.

1133
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,060
This year.

1134
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,500
It is.

1135
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,160
It is July 5th, 1999.

1136
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,100
Oh.

1137
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,660
Oh.

1138
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,900
I don't know if you guys know this.

1139
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,720
We are actually...

1140
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,880
We appeared in the new Weekly World News.

1141
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Oh, I thought you appeared in the nude with a weekly world news.

1142
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,020


1143
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,260
Weekly...

1144
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,320
With a weekly old...

1145
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,720
I'm sorry.

1146
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,860
No, I appeared in the...

1147
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,300
In the news.

1148
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
No, I appeared in the news.

1149
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,880
In the nude.

1150
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,780
In the news.

1151
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,680
Not me, but actually the Subgenius Foundation.

1152
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,300
Oh, the whole Subgenius Foundation was naked?

1153
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,340
Is in the weekly world news this week.

1154
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,920
We're actually an advertiser on page...

1155
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,820
Page 17.

1156
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:14,820


1157
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,800
Weekly World News?

1158
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,240
We're on the...

1159
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,260
Between live personal psychics and psychic source.

1160
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,620
Wow.

1161
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,860
Oh, and right above how anyone can get help by mail.

1162
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,540
There you'll see.

1163
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,020
You like me.

1164
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1165
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1166
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1167
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1168
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1169
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1170
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1171
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1172
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020


1173
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,780
Oh, you've got the Batman brand.

1174
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:27,780


1175
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,580
Well, I thought them weekly readers...

1176
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,880
Oh, yeah.

1177
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:36,760
Below the Granny dumping scandal and next to Hangover cures from around the world.

1178
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,700
This would be the Millennium Countdown Begins issue.

1179
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,880
OK.

1180
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,460
Next to...

1181
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm on the cover.

1182
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,440
The picture of barrel-headed people with the weird fish coming out of their mouth?

1183
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:45,940
Let me look.

1184
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,180
No.

1185
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:47,940
No.

1186
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,240
There's a Virgin Mary.

1187
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,140
No.

1188
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,540
No.

1189
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,800
Head of anger, no.

1190
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,260
No barrel-headed people with monkeys coming out.

1191
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,520
What...

1192
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
How about any fanny-headed people?

1193
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,020
Oh, no.

1194
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,760
Any what-headed?

1195
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,800
Fanny-headed.

1196
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,580
Fanny.

1197
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,860
I think she's trying to say ass-headed people.

1198
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,880
Ass-headed people.

1199
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,500
You know, with their buttocks coming out.

1200
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:04,700
What the hell?

1201
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,600
No?

1202
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,760
Cleveland must really have gotten hit bad.

1203
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,840
I heard that the Y2K bug had hit early.

1204
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,460
Is that true?

1205
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,460
Well, that's not exactly what it was.

1206
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,920
It was a virus, but it was actually one of them plethoral viruses that multiply like a bad virus.

1207
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,340
They got hit by a plethoral virus.

1208
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,700
Yeah, it's just one starch into another one, three or four grom, like a spangifora.

1209
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,740
It gets thicker and fatter until it's all everywhere.

1210
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Everyone's got it now here.

1211
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Jesus Christ.

1212
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,640
You mentioned your own name vainly.

1213
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,260
That's how bad it is.

1214
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,820
I'm using my own name in vain.

1215
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,500
It's enough to call your name vainly and wish you would come over here and make it warmer or something.

1216
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,080
Really?

1217
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,920
You want warmth?

1218
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,920
We want warmth and we want lots of heat.

1219
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Suffer, suckers.

1220
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,840
Suffer.

1221
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,880
You guys are too close to Akron for me to bring you any warmth.

1222
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,740
I'm sorry, man.

1223
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,360
You can move out of Cleveland if you want warmth.

1224
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,380
I'm telling you, I love you, Pete.

1225
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,940
You know I love all of you.

1226
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,080
Yeah, for fashion, yeah.

1227
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,340
It's just a town that I hate.

1228
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,000
If you guys just move somewhere else, move to a place that I like.

1229
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,760
Yeah.

1230
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,680
New Mexico.

1231
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,680
Or someplace with a gypsy comet.

1232
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,500
But Brushwood is so close to here.

1233
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,440
It's a good stepping stone.

1234
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,360
Yeah.

1235
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,220
Well, you know what the truth is?

1236
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,320
I feel that suffering brings us closer together as a human family.

1237
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,040
I used to be at the barbershop when they would drain my blood.

1238
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:21,740
Yes.

1239
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,360
That's where I learned that.

1240
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,760
I used to be at the barbershop when they would bleed me.

1241
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,000
Hey, suffering does bring you closer to...

1242
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,600
They used to bleed you at the barbershop?

1243
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,180
Yeah.

1244
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:29,780
To what?

1245
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,620
To replace you with antifreeze in the wintertime?

1246
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
No, they would put...

1247
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,460
It was like a cobalt blue color stuff in there.

1248
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
It wasn't antifreeze.

1249
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,580
What do you think it was?

1250
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,020
It might have been some sort of pro forma disease.

1251
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,520
I don't know.

1252
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,100
It could have been anything.

1253
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,420
Dave, did you know that Chaz had volunteered you as a test rider of our rocket ship

1254
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,820
that we're going to build at X-Day?

1255
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,060
Yeah.

1256
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,720
But it better not be.

1257
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,700
It better not be like a small one like the last time that got lodged up in my Turkish, man.

1258
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,180
No, no.

1259
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,920
This one will be bigger.

1260
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
It won't fit there this time.

1261
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,420
Huh?

1262
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,640
It'll be bigger.

1263
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,340
Yeah.

1264
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,860
Much bigger.

1265
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,300
It's got to be bigger, man.

1266
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
Because I almost didn't recover from that.

1267
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,340
You can't believe that was a rocket that we shoved.

1268
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,680
This one will actually have a seat on it.

1269
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,740
At X-Day, it wasn't really a rocket.

1270
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,280
Yeah.

1271
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,580
We just referred to it as that.

1272
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,480
I noticed it did have a strangely flesh color to it.

1273
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,220
This one will even have a seat on it.

1274
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,600
Yeah.

1275
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,760
Yeah, a seat.

1276
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,740
We have to have a seat.

1277
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,480
And we have to have like a giant metal flagpole.

1278
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah.

1279
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:24,740


1280
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:24,740


1281
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
Like a steering wheel kind of thing.

1282
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,780
I mean, that's how it works.

1283
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,100
It usually shoots up a straw, but we have to go bigger than that.

1284
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,460
Yeah.

1285
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,220
Well, just so long as the nuts and bolts are jagged enough on the outside to give me a

1286
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,840
little action going, because suffering does bring you closer to something.

1287
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,000
Hey, well, happy New Year.

1288
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,500
A blessing on Cleveland.

1289
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,820
And I got to pass off.

1290
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,160
Here's some more people here.

1291
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,600
You're going to pass out?

1292
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,200
So I got to pass on the phone, but I will try to give you some warmth.

1293
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,140
I'll try.

1294
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,080
Well, shine some of your light our way, even if you do hate this area.

1295
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,740
I will.

1296
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:54,860
I will.

1297
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,540
I don't.

1298
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,080
Like I said, I don't really hate it.

1299
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,540
I hate the weather like you guys.

1300
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
That's why I moved out.

1301
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:00,920
I'm sorry.

1302
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,660
If there's something I could do about it, I'd still be there.

1303
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,660
It'd ruin the whole ecosystem, really.

1304
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
You got to trust me on that one.

1305
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,640
Hold on.

1306
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,860
To have Christ.

1307
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,700
I got two words for you.

1308
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,500
Lake effect.

1309
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,480
Ha, ha, ha.

1310
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,360
Here, hold on.

1311
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,760
Wah, wah, wah.

1312
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,080
Well, I want to start playing this tape here.

1313
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,900
In Central American squares, where are they going to land?

1314
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,500
Ooh, the Central Americans?

1315
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,840
I think they're landing in our backyard.

1316
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,440
But how about the eyeballs?

1317
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,240
Huh?

1318
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,740
Are they protruding through the socket?

1319
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,920
Are they dangling down more than three inches?

1320
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,020
Oh, geez.

1321
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,140
They got all kinds of different calibrations.

1322
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,700
You need a lot of gauze and some alcohol.

1323
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah.

1324
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,580
And about a Styrofoam cup.

1325
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,140
Yeah.

1326
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,940
And a 45 with the hollow point shells.

1327
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,080
Oh, man.

1328
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,020
That is a real cocktail for those who are dangerous livers.

1329
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,620
Yeah.

1330
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,620
And then you want to take your shoes off, too.

1331
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,520
Yeah.

1332
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,820
And make sure your toenails are clean.

1333
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1334
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1335
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1336
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1337
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1338
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1339
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,800
Oh, I never take too much stock and clean my toenails.

1340
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,920
People hate it when guys don't keep their toenails clean.

1341
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,020
Who doesn't?

1342
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,100
Yeah, it makes me want to puke.

1343
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,000
Well, I don't care if you want to puke.

1344
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,440
I never clean my toenails.

1345
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,460
In fact, I love them faster.

1346
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,080
I understand.

1347
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,940
The guy who's talking to Dave right now is Sphinx Drummond, Colonel Sphinx Drummond of

1348
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,680
the Swinging Love Corpses, the little brother of Dr. Philodrummond.

1349
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,300
I understand.

1350
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,220
But, but, but...

1351
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:20,640
He's two inches old.

1352
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,860
But now...

1353
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,180
Sphinx Drummond?

1354
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,660
Oh, not Strom Thurmond.

1355
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,940
I never want to see that picture again.

1356
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,540
That was gross.

1357
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,640
Strom Thurmond?

1358
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,560
Yeah, in the buff.

1359
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,940
Shouting them rude obscenities.

1360
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,440
That mummified?

1361
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,780
Yeah.

1362
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,940
Can I say that?

1363
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,140
Well, it was a part of his body that took up his whole head, like you said.

1364
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,520
Is it okay to say that?

1365
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,580
It's okay.

1366
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,120
It's not really, but it is.

1367
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,880
About Strom Thurmond?

1368
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,440
About him being a mummified a-hole?

1369
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,380
I can say a-hole.

1370
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:44,520
Yeah, you can be mummified for that.

1371
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,860
Okay.

1372
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm cool with that.

1373
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,280
The government didn't mummify you for saying that?

1374
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,840
Yeah.

1375
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,860
They have these big, you know, like when Karnak, when they entombed all those pharaohs,

1376
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,100
actually what they did...

1377
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,220
Well, they had, there was this lightning bolt that struck from the sky.

1378
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,260
It was like this big old cloud and this lightning bolt struck and then these, it formed these

1379
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,680
giant mushrooms on the ground.

1380
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,420
Then this giant chasm opened up and sucked the mushrooms down into the, like to the center

1381
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,620
of the earth where there's this huge, huge thing type explosion.

1382
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,780
That was Tuesday, right?

1383
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,780
Anyway.

1384
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,380
Yeah.

1385
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,220
I just, it just blew me away.

1386
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,060
I couldn't handle it anymore.

1387
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,080
So somebody else is going to have to tell you about it.

1388
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:31,900
Oh, that was Colonel Sphinx Drummond of the Swinging Love Corpses.

1389
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,260
Wow.

1390
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,640
It's a star-studded night.

1391
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,780
Personal acquaintance of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1392
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,540
It's a star-studded night.

1393
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,180
Huh?

1394
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,180
It's a star-studded night here.

1395
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,160
And speaking of those like star studs that you put in your sequin pants and stuff, if

1396
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,780
you wanted to make a...

1397
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,200
Well, I can't understand anything at all.

1398
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1399
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1400
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1401
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1402
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1403
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1404
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1405
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1406
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1407
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,200


1408
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,040
The whole atmosphere here is tilting.

1409
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,200
The room is moving.

1410
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,740
His moon pants are studded.

1411
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,260
That's the...

1412
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,740
No, his moon pants are full.

1413
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,020
My moon pants are funny.

1414
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,500
He always gets...

1415
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,740
Yes.

1416
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,120
Oh.

1417
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh.

1418
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,260
Oh.

1419
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,620
Oh.

1420
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:05,900
Oh.

1421
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,180
Oh.

1422
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,320
Oh.

1423
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,380
Oh.

1424
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,920
Oh.

1425
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,440


1426
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:07,780


1427
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:07,820


1428
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,020
Oh.

1429
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,020


1430
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,540
Oh.

1431
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,100


1432
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:09,360


1433
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:09,500


1434
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:09,540


1435
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:09,560


1436
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:09,560


1437
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:09,560


1438
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,080
Oh.

1439
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1440
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1441
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1442
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1443
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1444
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1445
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1446
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1447
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


1448
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,420
Hey, well...

1449
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,440
No one's coming in here.

1450
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,920
We gotta party to go to.

1451
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,920
I want to get the hell out of here.

1452
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,800
So it's Tuesday already, right?

1453
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,840
I need to get off, and Earth needs to get off.

1454
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,560
And we all need to get off.

1455
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,740
All need to get off.

1456
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,760
So you're saying it's Tuesday already?

1457
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,080
It is Tuesday already.

1458
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,160
What is it?

1459
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,020
Wotans Day again?

1460
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,440
Tuesday...

1461
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,080
Wasn't she in the Addams Family thing?

1462
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,400
Who Tuesday Weld?

1463
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:37,960
Yeah.

1464
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,060
No, she played a bit part as a farm animal in the Sober Ellen Follower in the sir, Did

1465
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,040
Suzanne Struthers story.

1466
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,620
And then after that was preempted and stuff,

1467
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,100
they just disemboweled her and left her on the side of the road.

1468
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,900
Oh, my.

1469
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,500
And in this new year,

1470
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,840
in this new year,

1471
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,900
Weinstein's secret orchestra will become more secret than ever.

1472
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,660
Indeed.

1473
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,620
All the way, all the way, all the way.

1474
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,180
And Bob's pipe shall smoke ever more foul and disgusting odours.

1475
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,040
Right.

1476
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,380
And the Yeti shall rise up against the pink.

1477
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,580
Extinct.

1478
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,020
Extinct against the fumes.

1479
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,740
If you get away with more.

1480
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,460
Well, I hope that this isn't the final year.

1481
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,440
I mean, I do hope it is the final year.

1482
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,780
And that big mothership will come out of the atmosphere

1483
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,640
and lower down out of that early morning blue sky.

1484
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,960
And a long ladder will come out,

1485
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,060
and little bodies will come down from the ladder

1486
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,180
and will come and surround all the people,

1487
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,360
each at night.

1488
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,220
Not all the people would be surrounding each other.

1489
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,360
Putting their little hands upon our bodies.

1490
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,880
Their little tiny, soft, little magnetic hands.

1491
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,040
And as they rub your buttocks,

1492
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,320
you also levitate in a maglev motion

1493
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,600
and begin gyrating forward towards that ladder.

1494
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,060
And next thing you know,

1495
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,400
it's Alpha Centauri in your mind.

1496
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,500
It's all in your mind.

1497
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,440
Really.

1498
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,620
Unfortunately.

1499
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,040
I mean, it would be nice if they would really take us there,

1500
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,900
but I think it's kind of like a theme park ride.

1501
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,300
Will it be a theme ride?

1502
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:10,360


1503
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,300
Or will it be...

1504
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,020
A thematic.

1505
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,440
The future.

1506
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,140
Or will it be the pasture with a big old cow pie in it?

1507
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,480
Well, my friends, it has been so good to ring in the new year.

1508
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,760
I'm going to go ring my own bell,

1509
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,360
because I can't hear anything at all.

1510
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,600
Yes, that's the ringing in your head.

1511
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,780
Well, we're going to ring our bells, too.

1512
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,980
And I'm going to cut out of here early.

1513
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,640
Praise Dave.

1514
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,840
Praise Chaz.

1515
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,620
Praise Michelle.

1516
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,360
Praise Connie.

1517
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,040
Praise Bob.

1518
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,460
Praise Princess Wee.

1519
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,680
Praise all the Austinites and Connie Tights and Texamians.

1520
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,700
Praise Ivan.

1521
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,900
Praise the Lord.

1522
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,840
And all the evangelicals.

1523
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,160
And remember, that's not the bells tolling for you.

1524
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,120
That's the clap-trapping of your own testicles

1525
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,940
banging against your pants as you walk down Long Disty Road.

1526
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,600
And praise Jake.

1527
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,660
Praise Jake.

1528
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,420
Praise Peep.

1529
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,620
Praise Peep.

1530
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,120
And I.

1531
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,000
Good night from me.

1532
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,980
Good night from Manila, Mom.

1533
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,880
I've been waiting for a long time for this moment.

1534
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,300
Good night from...

1535
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,020
It's gone.

1536
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,140
Till next week, keep your hat on tight.

1537
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,400
You're back to the wind in your sack.

1538
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,620
In the saddle.

1539
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,960
Get your sack out of the saddle.

1540
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,720
Happy New Year, folks.

1541
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,420
You don't want to sit here for all year.

1542
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,060
Definitely.

1543
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:53,420
All in the new year's

1544
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,500
morning zar.

1545
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:57,880
All of our waves in the sky.

1546
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,480
We'll see you on the other side.

1547
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,520
Bye.

1548
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:58,520


1549
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,540
Oh, and friends, you can reach Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1550
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,880
You can reach out and touch that band and get tapes of the show and the music from,

1551
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,600
got that pencil ready, Post Office Box.

1552
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,220
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra, ESO.

1553
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,240
P.O. Box 81555.

1554
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,980
That's Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1555
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,640
44181.

1556
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,880
And, of course, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1557
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:13,220
Very, very Firesign-y and Einstein-y evening this particular time.

1558
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,600
It's not even an evening for me.

1559
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,800
This is a quarter of four on Wednesday afternoon for me.

1560
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,260
On January 27th.

1561
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,540
So that's how long the delay is before you hear these shows.

1562
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,300
Now you know.

1563
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,760
Number 666.

1564
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,060
Prise Bob.

1565
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,760
We lived that long.

1566
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,440
80 million miles from Earth.

1567
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,160
3.

1568
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,340
13.

1569
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,020
4.

1570
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,600
3.

1571
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:53,920
2.

1572
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,420
1.

1573
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,320
6.

1574
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:58,540
8.

1575
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:58,540


1576
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,100
2.

1577
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,460
1.

1578
00:50:59,460 --> 00:50:59,460


1579
00:50:59,460 --> 00:50:59,520
1.

1580
00:50:59,520 --> 00:50:59,620
2.

1581
00:50:59,620 --> 00:50:59,620


1582
00:50:59,620 --> 00:50:59,620


1583
00:50:59,620 --> 00:50:59,620


1584
00:50:59,620 --> 00:50:59,660
1.

1585
00:50:59,660 --> 00:50:59,660


1586
00:50:59,660 --> 00:50:59,820
2.

1587
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,040
1.

1588
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,200


1589
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:00,660
2.

1590
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,560
1.

1591
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,800
1.

1592
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,140
1.

1593
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,640
Well, of course, then that explains it, then,

1594
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,820
the more of the intergalactic garbage about getting off the planet.

1595
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,880
You guys want to build your own spaceships all the time

1596
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,480
and assume that somehow...

1597
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,880
Well, that can be taken both literally and metaphysically, Dave.

1598
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,260
I mean, some people want to build their own mental spaceship, you know.

1599
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,760
Bear with me. Humor me.

1600
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,420
You know, and that's like...

1601
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,500
Build your own ship is like make your own reality, dude.

1602
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,180
Every man and woman is a star.

1603
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,160
Do what keepeth thou from wilting.

1604
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,820
You know, visualize whirling pee.

1605
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,620
Well, is that what you meant when you said it's all right to go in?

1606
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,820
Visualize the great flush, dude.

1607
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,940
You know, that's what it means to some people.

1608
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,780
See, I thought when you were saying go in, either go out or go in.

1609
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,380
Go in.

1610
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,300
Then to other people.

1611
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,940
Build your own ship means, you know,

1612
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,600
rob 7-Elevens until you have enough money to buy the rocket fuel,

1613
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,580
build a huge tube and pack the fuel at the bottom

1614
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,280
and pack yourself on top and light that booger up

1615
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,700
and take off, daddy-o-hoo!

1616
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,300
Apollo 69, we're having a party.

1617
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,960
What's with the boogers and tubers, though?

1618
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,020
I don't understand that part.

1619
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,360
You can build your own ship out of bamboo.

1620
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,900
Well, you're trying to bamboozle us into believing it, Stang.

1621
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,320
I think it takes a lot more.

1622
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,880
More than faith and cheese to build a mighty rocket ship

1623
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,680
that can blast off to another cosmos.

1624
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,500
Come on, man.

1625
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,580
Come on, man.

1626
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,500
Come on, man.

1627
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,100
Well, I'm not saying that if it was easy, everybody would be doing it.

1628
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,020
I know.

1629
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,640
I just want to repeat myself.

1630
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,860
You're a subgenius, Dave.

1631
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,800
You can do things that humans just would never even attempt.

1632
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,220
We can look between the ridges of the mountains

1633
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,020
and find the rocket ship parts that were hidden there.

1634
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,820
That's this important thing that we all have to remember.

1635
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,280
It's sleepos, believe it or not.

1636
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,860
What?

1637
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,120
Sleepos.

1638
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:02,820
What?

1639
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,240
What?

1640
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,920
Please, believe it or not.

1641
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,760
But are we really capable of doing this?

1642
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,740
I mean, do we really have to?

1643
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,680
Okay, basically what you have to do is you're camping.

1644
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,140
See the incredible two-headed baby.

1645
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,620
See the incredible 19-headed baby.

1646
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,340
See the 10-headed chocolate triceratops.

1647
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,340
Exactly.

1648
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:17,900
Yes.

1649
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,460
And if you're camping with normals,

1650
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,680
let's say you go on a camping trip with normals.

1651
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,440
Oh, God.

1652
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,600
Okay, we'll go with the assumption.

1653
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,640
Yes, it happens all the time.

1654
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,060
And what you have to do is you have to make some divertment or something

1655
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,680
so they'll all run off in some other direction.

1656
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,860
You can scream,

1657
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,560
Will the Beast.

1658
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,560
By yourself.

1659
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,680
Yes.

1660
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,520
And you can scan the ridges with the special glasses that are sent to you.

1661
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,880
But they make everything look so unearthly, lunar, and cold.

1662
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,560
And they say when you walk through those glasses,

1663
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,720
you get cold nipples walking through it.

1664
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,260
I'm sorry, what?

1665
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,900
You can find the spaceship parts hidden in the crevices and stuff.

1666
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,240
You have to find like a...

1667
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,780
Is that what those glasses are for?

1668
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,240
Yeah, yeah.

1669
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,700
Cut through mine away.

1670
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,540
Yeah.

1671
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,600
I thought it was just a...

1672
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,240
No, no, no.

1673
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,300
You have to go to a spot with like lots of ridges and crevices.

1674
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,360
And then if you put them on,

1675
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,600
you will find the spaceship parts that were left there for us.

1676
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,840
And you may not find a complete...

1677
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,160
Oh, my best stuff like old license plates and tin cans.

1678
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,320
No, no.

1679
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,700
If you're not wearing the glasses, that's all you'll find, of course.

1680
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,780
In the swamp.

1681
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,500
Yeah.

1682
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,140
And you have to make sure that everybody's behind you

1683
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,340
because anybody who passes in front of the actual field of these glasses

1684
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,680
gets unearthly, ungodly cold.

1685
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,240
It turns everything kind of a blue with a little frosty thing on it.

1686
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,900
I never can tell when you guys are serious and when you're not.

1687
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,300
We are dead serious, man.

1688
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,380
No, we were doing this before Viagra.

1689
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,460
What it does is it gives a man a huge throbbing...

1690
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,600
You noticed that, of course.

1691
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,080
A ridges.

1692
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,860
It gives you...

1693
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,780
It puts ridges in...

1694
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,040
No, I threw mine away.

1695
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:46,860
Oh.

1696
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:47,880
Well, okay.

1697
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,920
Well, see, now you're calling me stupid all the time, man.

1698
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,940
I knew those things did something right already.

1699
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,480
Oh, God.

1700
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,800
What's in my trash can?

1701
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,220
Oh, my God.

1702
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,540
Oh.

1703
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,160
Oh.

1704
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,240
Oh, forget it.

1705
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,320
It's gone, huh?

1706
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,440
I'll wait until the next cereal box.

1707
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,220
I told you not to...

1708
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,000
I told you not to reach into that thing, Stangy.

1709
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,940
I'll wait until the...

1710
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,560
I'll get it out of the next bottle of Captain Crunch.

1711
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,840
But, you see, the other ones, there's a pair that if you turn down the infrared scope,

1712
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,980
if you walk in front of them, you lose everything in the ridges,

1713
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,360
and everybody who walks in front of the field of vision gets unrightfully hot.

1714
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,160
Are those the ones that come with Crunch Berries?

1715
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:20,800
Pardon?

1716
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,500
No, no, no.

1717
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,900
These are the special ones that were sent to you.

1718
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,060
You know, I can't really talk about it on the radio.

1719
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,560
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.

1720
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,220
Remember the ones that they had the little Mr. Cow logo,

1721
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,540
and he had the little doobie sticking out of his nostril?

1722
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

1723
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,100
You can call it the original West.

1724
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,660
You can call the ones that they had the Mr. Cow logo over the left eye, okay?

1725
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,120
Yeah, that was so...

1726
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:43,440
And, okay, again, if you're a male and you see anything with a ridge or a fold or a crease...

1727
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,760
You're going to pop one.

1728
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,520
...you'll get inexplicable sexual excitement.

1729
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,340
If you're a woman and you wear these same glasses,

1730
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,660
you'll get the same inexplicable sexual excitement looking at anything.

1731
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,620
Well, it depends upon your predilection sexually, I guess.

1732
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,740
Well, that's a shame.

1733
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,360
Some people, they want to look at...

1734
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,300
So they'd get more excited by ridges that had a lot of bushes on them,

1735
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,580
and others would be excited by ridges that had no bushes?

1736
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,540
Yes.

1737
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,720
Yes, you could probably take it that far.

1738
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,160
Or some would like the real fresh ridges, and some would like the old ravines.

1739
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,400
And some women...

1740
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,860
So you're a woman and you look at a pencil, a heterosexual woman,

1741
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,900
and you look at a pencil, or even a gay man, and you look at a pencil,

1742
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,240
then you'll just, you know...

1743
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,060
You'll be coming...

1744
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,760
...wearing the glasses.

1745
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,300
You'll just...

1746
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,400
Yeah, but they are really...

1747
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,060
So they're like those...

1748
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,540
Those x-ray specs, but they're...

1749
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,120
They're like a cross between x-ray specs, the glasses, and they live.

1750
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,540
Yes, exactly.

1751
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,520
They allow you to see what's really printed on the money and stuff.

1752
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,740
Well, they're not exactly.

1753
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,560
Okay, I guess...

1754
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,720
They actually tap directly into your Jettison sexual circuit,

1755
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,980
which is also programmed with the thing to find the spaceship parts, see?

1756
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,260
Oh, see...

1757
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,440
That's why they don't want us to access that part of our brain.

1758
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,300
I missed that whole thing, man.

1759
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,440
Yeah, because then it's like your body becomes a veritable dowsing rod for...

1760
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,000
Exactly.

1761
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,420
...just a spaceship part, John.

1762
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:01,420


1763
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,300
Your proboscis itself is actually going...

1764
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,940
Your erected manogram is actually going around pounding and pointing and looking for different parts.

1765
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,800
Well, I've been wondering, because the last time I went to the Grand Canyon,

1766
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,260
there were these guys in Devo glasses that were like...

1767
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,400
They look like...

1768
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,000
To tell the truth, they look kind of like they were humping piles of broken glass that were down in there.

1769
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,660
A mí me parece.

1770
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,280
Yeah, garbage piles and stuff.

1771
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,020
If you had taken a good look at those glasses, you probably would have noticed...

1772
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,080
Ah, me buena.

1773
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,740
...a little smiling cow.

1774
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,680
I thought they were just weirdos.

1775
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,600
They were tripping.

1776
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,020
No, no, no.

1777
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,140
They probably found the parts.

1778
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,040
You probably couldn't even see the parts that they'd found.

1779
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,340
They probably took home the parts I could have used.

1780
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,240
Yeah, exactly.

1781
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,200
Because they didn't throw their glasses away.

1782
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,180
Yeah, yeah.

1783
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,260
Well, I bet I've still got my membership card, and they don't.

1784
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,300
I've still got my subgenius minister card.

1785
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:47,720
Yeah.

1786
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,520
Spaceship ticket.

1787
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,560
But this also explains why there's so much, you know, bad sex hurt.

1788
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,460
And bad pornography.

1789
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,820
Because people are using their glasses incorrectly?

1790
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,100
Did you know...

1791
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,380
Speaking of cards and things, Bleepo, did you know that five...

1792
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:07,340
Five minutes before X-Day, I suddenly realized I didn't even have my membership card in my pocket.

1793
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:12,180
And I left it in my other pants in the car when I changed into my preaching suit.

1794
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,340
My special rupturing suit.

1795
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,280
Well, what does this have to do with the fossilized toad stuff you were talking about earlier?

1796
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,300
Well, we're getting to that, if you'll have a little bit of patience today.

1797
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,820
Okay, I'm waiting, man, because you said that was a really good part of it.

1798
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:25,940
All right.

1799
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,700
I think Bleepo was just getting around to that, but you had to go and spoil the...

1800
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:29,940
God.

1801
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,440
The timing.

1802
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,500
Yeah, I know, but just think of it, man.

1803
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,980
It's been around for so long.

1804
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,120
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1805
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,000
I mean, it was around just so long ago.

1806
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,600
You know how that whole thing about the brain development, like the first part of your brain is the reptilian brain?

1807
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,500
Yeah, yeah.

1808
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,960
The second part is the amphibian brain.

1809
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,860
Yeah, yeah.

1810
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,380
And how it mimics evolution and all that.

1811
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:44,780
Okay.

1812
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,980
Right, the third part is Newt Gingrich.

1813
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,280
For a long, long time, it stopped.

1814
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:50,900
Exactly.

1815
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,160
It stopped at toads.

1816
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,460
People don't realize that evolution just sort of stopped at toads.

1817
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,100
For a long time?

1818
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,920
Well, when you're a developing fetus, you are a toad.

1819
00:58:59,920 --> 00:58:59,920


1820
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,380
I was a toad fetus for a while.

1821
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:01,960
Yeah, yeah.

1822
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,480
And I think that's the...

1823
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,880
Well, yeah, it doesn't really...

1824
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,560
You are a toad, very briefly.

1825
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,340
Yes, yes.

1826
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,360
But in actual evolution itself, something happened.

1827
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,600
I don't remember what it was.

1828
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,880
I wasn't there, but...

1829
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,300
I think it was called the Devonian period.

1830
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,420
Yes, yes.

1831
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,520
But it actually lasted...

1832
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,480
People don't realize how long that period lasted.

1833
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,660
It was a long...

1834
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,720
And people don't know how long periods are.

1835
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,800
There was no time then.

1836
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,020
Oh.

1837
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,480
Especially if you measure Darwinian time,

1838
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,680
it goes from one sunset to the next sunset.

1839
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,820
Well, Bleepo, you're right.

1840
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,860
The age of giant amphibians actually was as long as the age of dinosaurs.

1841
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,040
Precisely, precisely.

1842
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,300
And was followed by a really bizarre age,

1843
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,200
which was the age of large reptilian mammals.

1844
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,560
Okay, these...

1845
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:46,980
Who hardly...

1846
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,280
Who were so weird-looking that they don't get any press.

1847
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:50,960
Yeah.

1848
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,820
I mean, they were just too weird to even be believed.

1849
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,340
They were like tiger poodle areops.

1850
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:57,900
Yeah.

1851
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,720
And dinosaurs.

1852
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,900
Flying tiger poodle areops.

1853
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,060
Yeah.

1854
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,980
No, it'd be more like a chameleon mixed with a schnauzer or something like that.

1855
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,180
Right, yeah.

1856
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,080
I mean, they were insane.

1857
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,400
And I'm not lying.

1858
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,900
I mean, these are the fantastic animals, yes.

1859
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,220
Yeah.

1860
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,860
And that was like in between the giant amphibians and the dinosaurs.

1861
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,540
Mm-hmm.

1862
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,180
Right.

1863
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,720
But then...

1864
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,860
Were these mammal-like, reptile-like, you know,

1865
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,180
giant, insane platypus-preying mantis combination.

1866
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:22,760
Yeah.

1867
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,900
For a long time, basically, the Planet X time scopes couldn't go back, you know,

1868
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,800
to any other period.

1869
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,400
They're just stuck in that period, too.

1870
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,760
That was a boring period.

1871
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,020
I think what it was was there was...

1872
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,560
Unless you were a giant reptile or a giant amphibian.

1873
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,920
Well, I think what it was was there was a very powerful sort of organic time magnet.

1874
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,440
Well, think of this way, Boopers.

1875
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,080
That formed at that time.

1876
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,840
That's true, see?

1877
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,540
That's true.

1878
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,880
It was a time magnet.

1879
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,840
Thank God.

1880
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,780
Because any time there's a scope, what you just called a scope,

1881
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,420
that means you're deleting the initially most important part.

1882
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,840
And as you do it within the same time reference of the beginning and the end,

1883
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,740
and you've scoped something, so to speak...

1884
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,080
Yeah, yeah.

1885
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,480
You've scoped...
