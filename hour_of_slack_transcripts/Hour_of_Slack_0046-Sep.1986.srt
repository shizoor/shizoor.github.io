23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,880
What about Slack?

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,100
That's your key phrase.

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,280
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,120
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,820
Hour of Slack.

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,740
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,540
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,180
of the Church of the Subgenius, with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the

31
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,840
Subgenius.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,020
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,840
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Living Avatar.

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,560
Here's the Didn't Ask, like or A

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,180
Ew!

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,420
This is Ralph was posting a video It seems as though we've learned some lessons using

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,420


39
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,780
While we were talking over the radio, Rob screws us a bunch.

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,420
Like a joke!

41
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,760
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,240
No, that's what he calls automate video.

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,800
He knows that I'm doing something.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,300
Ah, I'm trying to think.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,680
He knows that he knows the English language.

46
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,020
Moses went up to the mountain high

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,960
To find out from God

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,440
Why did you make us?

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,860
Why?

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,300
Secret words in a secret room

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,780
He said,

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Wop-bop-a-loo-bop

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,420
A-lop-bam-boom

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,660
I did not put you here to suffer

55
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,660
I did not put you here to whine

56
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,600
I put you here to love one another

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,400
And the kiddos have a good time now, now, now

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,720
Let my people go, go, go

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,160
You gotta let my people go, go, go

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,260
Let my people go, go, go

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,260
You gotta let my people go

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,260
Yeah

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I'm trying to fix a thing

64
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,080
Battlin' cherry coal

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,060
You tell the boys with the horns

66
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,960
Get down and blow

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,380
They rear back

68
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,900
Aim their bells at the stars

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,540
He said,

70
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,260
Feed me, Big Daddy

71
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,240
Eight to the par

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,340
I did not put you here to suffer

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,280
I did not put you here to whine

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,440
I put you here to love one another

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,560
And the kiddos have a good time now, now, now, now

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,660
Let my people go, go, go

77
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,680
You gotta let my people go, go, go

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,560
Let my people go, go, go

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,940
You gotta let my people go

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,740
That's it

81
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh!

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh!

83
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:27,580


84
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:57,580


85
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:27,580


86
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,940
.

87
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:41,120
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang, and you're listening to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry,

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,480
the outreach arm of the Church of the Subgenius.

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,500
And, oh, yes, dear friends,

91
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,740
that was, uh, that first song was The Rainmaker.

92
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,600
See, every now and then, about once per show,

93
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,060
we play an album or tape that you can actually buy in the stores.

94
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,920
But, and, uh, tonight, we had, uh,

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,380
or last week, I promised you, for this week,

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,520
the Subgenius Anti-Drug Show.

97
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,580
But, unfortunately, the conspiracy...

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,260
Ooh!

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,440
No, that's right.

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,460
It's too scary to do the Anti-Drug Show this week.

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:38,300
So, uh, because my conspiracy job just, man, it was my week in the barrel, friends.

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,580
That's all there is to it.

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:47,000
And, uh, so I barely had time to just cue up a lot of subgenius music.

104
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,880
And, uh, almost everything we're playing tonight is by members of the church.

105
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
But don't freak out, because it's pretty, pretty heavy duty.

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,580
Uh, ahem.

107
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,080
In, in fact, you're gonna hear the secrets of the Squirtin' Universe

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,240
from Doctors for Bob coming up in just a couple of seconds here.

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,580
Get the, uh...

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,280
Well, listen to this wonderful disco music.

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,440
This is called Beginning of Time.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,520
And as the primitive subgeniuses carry the mighty stones of the Dobbs Pyramid

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,680
across the desert,

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,340
pterodactyls wheeling about them over their heads,

115
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,920
and Tyrannosauruses fighting in the distance,

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,420
we slowly move over into the other universe,

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,900
the universe of slack,

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
where the subgeniuses don't...

119
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,200
have to build the giant temple,

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,900
but instead have to fight saber-toothed tigers

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,480
and conspiracy Cro-Magnon people.

122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,080
You know, there's a, a common theory that the subgeniuses are those of us who are descended,

123
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,720
not, not necessarily from the Yetis or the Abominable Snowmen,

124
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,420
but from the Neanderthal creatures, you know.

125
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,860
The, the Neanderthals were wiped out by the Cro-Magnons.

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,700
So they say, about 35,000 years ago.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,860
Personally, I prefer to believe that the Neanderthal gene, uh, lives on in some few of us

128
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,440
who, uh, carry on the great word of the Neanderthal,

129
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,780
those who worship Wotan, Ra, and other great its of the sky.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,060
Ah, yes.

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,920
Ha ha.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,740
I think we allmayı all the key for the竅

133
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,040
I hope your high r patient is jowechsel fully in.

134
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,960
And don't forgete..

135
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,260
Bardock.

136
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,420
O throat,

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,080
presumptuouly,

138
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,040
it's your truly.

139
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:26,280
No, it's wood.

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Bob?

141
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,420
Bob?

142
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,260
Bob?

143
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:01,300
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

144
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,260
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with the Sorry Truth.

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,280
Now, friend, look around you and face facts.

146
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,440
The world is composed mostly of jerks.

147
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
All kinds of ignorant, dangerous, thoughtless louts are in positions of power and influence,

148
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,900
while some of the most deserving people you know,

149
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,620
are slugging it out in a thankless cycle of brain-breaking labor and mental paralysis.

150
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
Checks and balances? What a joke.

151
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,960
Friend, if you want to get slack, then you better uphold the Great Covenant, yes?

152
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,300
Before you were born, you swore you'd help in the great battle against them?

153
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
That's right, them!

154
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,680
The normals, the mediocrities, the Barbies and Kens, the pink boys, the somnambulax, the cage men,

155
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,440
the time servers, the Philistines, the witch-murders!

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
Those who have made...

157
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,140
Slack!

158
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,540
Slack!

159
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,500
Taboo!

160
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,480
That's right, friend, there's only two races in this world, us and them.

161
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,260
Whose side are you on, eh?

162
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Now that your pictures in the paper being perfectly as mine and you can't have it,

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,620
the one that you have ever desired, all you gotta tell me now is why, why, why, why,

164
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,660
welcome to the workin' week!

165
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,100
Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you,

166
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,240
Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you,

167
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,440
Welcome to the workin' week!

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,820
You gotta do it till you do it, so you better get into it!

169
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,800
All of your family had to kill to survive,

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,580
And this the waitin' for the big day to arrive,

171
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,280
But if you are out there, you better be alive!

172
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,120
Welcome to the workin' week!

173
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you,

174
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,820
Welcome to the workin' week!

175
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,120
You gotta do it till you do it, so you better get into it!

176
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,760
I hear you sayin' that this is alright when you're only readin' American books,

177
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,880
Spent all your money gettin' so convinced that you never even thought of us,

178
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,760
Sometimes I wonder if we're livin' in the same land,

179
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,840
Why'd you wanna be my friend when I feel like a chum runnin' outta hands?

180
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,400
Welcome to the workin' week!

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,720
Oh, I, welcome to the workin' week!

182
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,940
Welcome to the workin' week!

183
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:24,940


184
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,160
Friend, the devil is tearin' the family apart,

185
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,740
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs!

186
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,640
Conspiracy, corporate, peak situations where mommy and daddy get up in the mornin' and go to work,

187
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,940
And they kiss the kids goodbye, it's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye,

188
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,920
Kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello,

189
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,100
Then they get home about seven o'clock, ticked off, to use the polite term,

190
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,880
After a long drive back out to the suburbs,

191
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,900
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and goodnight, and they go to bed,

192
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:04,600
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family is cause the kids see a little titterin' stupid sexy gags on television,

193
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,860
Or cause of the new permissiveness where men are allowed to do things with other men,

194
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:17,460
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend, I say, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

195
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,660
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids, most of these kids these days grow up, they don't have parents,

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,760
They got some kind of robot scarecrows, and a friend lettin' her be slack.

197
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,080
Religion?

198
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:41,900
Here's one of the basic tenets of religion, it says here, Jesus is our Bob, Bob is our hope, Jesus is Bob Hope.

199
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,500
That's one of the tenets of the religion.

200
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,220
What I wanna know about is slack, I seem to see the word slack mentioned a lot.

201
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,920
Well that's, we've lost our original slack, and Bob is here to help us regain it,

202
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:05,200
Some people have a greater proportion of it than others, but slack is essentially what you need to be able to do whatever the hell you want.

203
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,380
Okay.

204
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,980
So then you could say Bill, for example, is suffering from slacklessness.

205
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,020
Well I don't know.

206
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,980
This station seems to have a much greater proportion of slack than others in the area.

207
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,760
That's right, we are truly original and we, in, in, in,

208
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,560
Full of slack.

209
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,060
Yeah, in most, in, as I understand it, we are full of slack, cause we are different from everyone else,

210
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:36,580
We are not dictated by the norms of society and of commercial radio, we try to do our own thing on XCI, especially on morning sickness.

211
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,080
That's right, Bob would not choose to appear on any other radio station, I don't think.

212
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,800
Oh that's, we're very honored, did you hear that?

213
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Bob and the Church of the Subgenius would never be represented.

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,200
We're represented by a commercial, represented, for example, on Jerry Christopher's show.

215
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,780
Who needs him?

216
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,800
He's, he's got no slack.

217
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:59,240
So if the listeners want to call and talk to the Reverend Ray Dodge, all you have to do is pick up your phone during this next song, call 744-5-

218
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:10,920
Maria, I've just kissed a girl named Maria, and suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be.

219
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:23,640
I can't dance, I can't dance, besides I look so awful in these braces.

220
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:32,840
If that boy wants me to dance, I'll just die, I'm so tall and he's about three feet high.

221
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,160
Not three.

222
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,080
Oh you say you're playing huge, you're neither sure you're worth choosing, but you're still undersized about me.

223
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,020
Oh, oh.

224
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh, time for the killing floor.

225
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,660
Now he's spilling whiskey and learning songs about the one that got away.

226
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,640
Vacation, vacation, vacation, Bob and Steve.

227
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,240
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

228
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Let your body be sucked out of your ears, for we're going to take you deeper.

229
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,220
Deep, deep inside yourself to the place of silence and the noise.

230
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:26,120
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness, down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

231
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,980
We bore down into the cranium, drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality.

232
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,420
Piercing the squamous epizootis, rolling around in the hollowed out inside of the skull.

233
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,640
Scraping along the edges of the birth canal and stretching the imaginary.

234
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,700
The imagination gland until it pops.

235
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,260
Now, let all your thoughts drain out through the brain pan.

236
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,220
Tumble down through the sinuses, slide down the esophagus and finally let them plunge to the base of the soul itself.

237
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,160
Located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

238
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,820
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

239
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,440
And it is Bob.

240
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,260
Bob.

241
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,540
Bob.

242
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,780
You've got to get out of here, quick.

243
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,880
I know you haven't had much practice, but you've got to start thinking.

244
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,260
You must want to think.

245
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,900
I'd rather not do anything.

246
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,120
And the Thargians don't want you to do anything, even eating or breathing.

247
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,000
Breathing?

248
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,860
But I've always breathed.

249
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,860
I can't stop now.

250
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,840
Then get started thinking.

251
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,460
Think, boy, think.

252
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,820
What do I think about?

253
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,040
Think of birds that swim and fish that fly.

254
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's see.

255
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,200
Birds that swim and fish that fly.

256
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,180
Words that begin with J.

257
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,920
It's working, it's working.

258
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,900
Keep thinking.

259
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,440
Dinosaur insteps, potato ice cream.

260
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,820
Potato insteps and dino ice cream.

261
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,700
Dinosaur ice cream.

262
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,780
Faster, boy, faster.

263
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,020
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

264
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,820
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

265
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,780
Albert Einstein, E equals MC squared.

266
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,420
Albert Einstein, E equals MC squared.

267
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,260
William Shakespeare.

268
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,660
Anthony Trollope, Isaac Newton.

269
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,080
Faster, boy, faster.

270
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Roger Bacon, John Stuart Mill.

271
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,120
Baby, really.

272
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
F-E-B-R-U-A-R-Y.

273
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,600
15 times 86 equals 1290.

274
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,640
Then carry the three.

275
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,720
.

276
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,840
.

277
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,980
.

278
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:38,980


279
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,580
.

280
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,840
.

281
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,300
.

282
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,400
.

283
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,420
.

284
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,520
.

285
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:54,840
.

286
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:54,880
.

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,380
.

288
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,320
.

289
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,680
.

290
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:10,820
.

291
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,880
.

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:10,960
.

293
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,020
.

294
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,040
.

295
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,200
.

296
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,260
.

297
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,460
For the primal sound of the boring, laid-back meditation universe

298
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,380
Might it need me?

299
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, but the primal sound of the

300
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,700
Bobble-thumpin' black-eyed pea

301
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,300
Back to the old stuff

302
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,700
Squirtin' universe is

303
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,000
For they know not the glories

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,840
And that which has been called the squirtin' universe

305
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:53,620
For the purpose of life is not happiness, peace, or even truth

306
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,780
But the purpose of the universe is to squirt

307
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,580
For 50% of the universe, that is

308
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,700
For slightly over 50%

309
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,500
The purpose of the universe is to ooze

310
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,820
For the purpose of life is not happiness, peace, or even truth

311
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
But the story of

312
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,740
Is an all-encompassing tale

313
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,500
Which tells of the

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,640
The utter transformation of the universe in the final days

315
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,020
As was written in

316
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,700
Ecclesians 5.17

317
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,480
For in the end times there shall be

318
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,820
The one world religion

319
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,080
Predicted in the Bible

320
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,920
And that shall be called the church of the subgenius

321
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,080
And there shall be a band

322
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,740
A band which shall, which will, was, and shall be known as

323
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,240
The Doctors for Bob

324
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,340
And lo, the Doctors for Bob

325
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,180
Was the very hand, the very tool of God

326
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,320
So to speak

327
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,220
And that which was called the squirtin' universe

328
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,820
The squirtin' universe

329
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,660
For the true purpose of Doctors for Bob

330
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,960
Which could finally be revealed at last

331
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,640
Is to speak every word

332
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,980
To sing every song

333
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,580
To make every sound

334
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,540
Every noise

335
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,300
Melodic or un-melodic

336
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,820
Heart-pounding

337
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,000
Possible in all infinite variations of the universe

338
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,340
We're not bound by any laws of

339
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
Quality

340
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,400
Good, our songs don't have to be good

341
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,520
Because it is our duty to write

342
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,120
Every song that is left

343
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,120
To utter every syllable

344
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,720
So that every name of God shall be uttered

345
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,200
So that the universe might end

346
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,740
Yes, friends, we are here to sing

347
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,600
That the universe ends for the proper reasons

348
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,720
For in 1998

349
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,560
Slightly before the arrival of the Exists

350
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,340
Our mission will have been fulfilled

351
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,700
We shall meet we have to meet

352
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,200
That we shall have uttered

353
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,320
Every syllable

354
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,600
Spoken every possible name of God

355
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,080
Or Jehovah One

356
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,460
Or Ram or Allah

357
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,900
Whichever name of God you call him

358
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,440
And you'll be at Doc Stock 17

359
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,760
The Doctors for Bob shall be performing

360
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,240
What people little suspect

361
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Is their last performance

362
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,000
And at the exact precise correct moment

363
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,140
Snavely, excellent

364
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,540
The mighty, mighty saxophone player

365
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,840
For Doctors for Bob

366
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,320
Shall hit a wrong note

367
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,000
Which lo and behold shall be

368
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,580
In fact, in actuality the right note

369
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,140
And as he hits that wrong note

370
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
It will be a note so wrong

371
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,400
That the entire universe shall start to crumble

372
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,060
All energy of all universes

373
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,280
Of all dimensions

374
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,920
Of all time frames

375
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,200
Of all realities

376
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,860
Shall be channeled

377
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,000
Through the cheap amplifiers of Doctors for Bob

378
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,360
Yes, the universe shall be destroyed

379
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,900
By amplification equipment bought on credit

380
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,300
At Boyd's Music Center

381
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,880
Yay! Lo and behold!

382
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,500
And as all energy of all known universes

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,980
Begins to be channeled through their amplifiers

384
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,800
A new and heretofore unknown force shall be created

385
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,780
A force which shall be known as anti-sound

386
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,420
And you thought anti-music was sound

387
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,660
Anti-music is a force which has never

388
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,700
And by its very nature

389
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,780
Can never exist in this universe

390
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,160
Anti-sound is a force unlike anything

391
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,820
Ever experienced before in any known universe

392
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,280
In any time continuum

393
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,080
The only reason it is even called

394
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,340
That the word sound

395
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,460
Is even in the title anti-sound

396
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,480
Is so that you'll have some type of reference point

397
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,140
But anti-sound has nothing to do with sound

398
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,340
These waves

399
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,880
These rays

400
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,080
These forces of anti-sound

401
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,360
Shall vibrate

402
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,300
Or anti-vibrate I might say

403
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,680
Through the entire universe

404
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,820
And the entire universe

405
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,360
Will lose its form

406
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,940
It shall be destroyed

407
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,320
Every molecule shall be demagnetized

408
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,700
From every other molecule

409
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,820
Every electron demagnetized

410
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,660
From every other electron

411
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,980
Every proton demagnetized

412
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,960
From every other proton

413
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,560
Every atom shall be repelled

414
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,980
From every other atom

415
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,260
The universe shall lose its form

416
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,900
As we know it today

417
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,820
Boyd's Music Center

418
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,570
Born to lose

419
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,110
And now I'm losing

420
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,070
Universal form

421
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,070
Hyperclites shall quip

422
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,070
Breaking off one last one liner

423
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,810
Before the universe

424
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,190
Loses its form

425
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,570
But Lord behold

426
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,570
Nothing is ever destroyed

427
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,050
For the universe is eternal

428
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,990
Thus matter cannot be created

429
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,730
Or destroyed

430
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,910
It is only

431
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,870
And merely

432
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,230
Transformed

433
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,650
And it shall be

434
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,890
Lo transformed

435
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,950
In the following manner

436
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:54,250
Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Bäh Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

437
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,330
Well dear friends

438
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,010
Yeah see we can't play the rest of that

439
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,030
that amazing Doctors for Bob tune,

440
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,670
the squirting universe, the pretty song,

441
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,190
because, well, the fate of the universe

442
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,550
turns out to be extremely X-rated.

443
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,950
And in keeping with that theme,

444
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,130
let's go to this tune we got from Dallas' own graph.

445
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,410
I'm afraid they're moving on to Austin soon.

446
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,530
This one was from the...

447
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,150
What? We are?

448
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,190
We're still on the air.

449
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,790
I'm scared of all this because I'm not me any longer.

450
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,450
I've been hurt so long by the conspiracy.

451
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,730
Okay, you can see I'm on the channel on air.

452
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,310
Punch up the Vredes machine.

453
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,690
Okay, we'll play a California music for you now.

454
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,170
Okay.

455
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,410
Wham!

456
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:48,530
Whoa!

457
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,010
Whoa!

458
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,230
That sound is more important than your entire life.

459
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,990
Well, that's probably...

460
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,370
That's probably true.

461
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,250
Anyway, let's go on to,

462
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,550
after that little word from the California subgenius show,

463
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,670
this is the Gravity Pilots with Bob is Sex.

464
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,430
Bob.

465
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,190
Bob.

466
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,090
Bob.

467
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,110
Bob.

468
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,150
Bob.

469
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,430
Bob.

470
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,190
Bob is Sex.

471
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,190
Bob is Sex.

472
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,190


473
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,710
Bob is Sex.

474
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,250
Bob?

475
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,610
Bob is Sex.

476
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,930
Who told you that?

477
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,570
Bob.

478
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,830
Bob is Sex.

479
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,730
Bob is Sex.

480
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:55,730


481
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,250
Bob.

482
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:58,730
Bob.

483
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,690
Bob.

484
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,170
Bob.

485
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,370
Bob is Sex.

486
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,050
He told you like aech that you have sex.

487
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,410
Bob is Sex.

488
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,650
Bob is Sex.

489
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,190
Bob is Sex.

490
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,990
Bob is Sex.

491
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:37,210
Young girl, they can be yours.

492
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,850
Lovely sheep.

493
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,710
Oh, yes, dear friends, that was a lovely little hymn from the Gravity Pilots.

Nation on the planet Earth.

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,590
Right here in Dallas, Fort Worth.

521
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,930
Oh, yeah, help me somebody.

522

Okay, well, this is the Chicago subgenius band under the,

it's called the People's Temple.

524
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,050
I thought, what a pretty name.

525
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,070
This is Pope Michael Flores in Chicago

526
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,190

I'll be right back.

530
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,230
Brothers and sisters,

531
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,330
I want you to put down your frock,

532
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,590
get those chainsaws and open up your ears,

533
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,990
and listen to this song.

534
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,410
story

535
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,190
in the vast continuity of

536
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,970
there were people there with sensible

537
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,530
and there were children there

538
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,530
with no wounds of distinction

539
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,770
there were women there

540
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,370
who was thought of as virtuous

541
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,490
but they contained the blood

542
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,850
of the ruling class

543
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,490
of Sewell Park

544
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,150
I said men cried

545
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,870
babies died

546
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,050
children fell

547
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,570
men sighed

548
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,290
babies cried

549
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,350
men died

550
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,230
children fell

551
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,430
women suffered

552
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,210
people wanted repentance

553
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,990
and victims

554
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,730
they wanted to escape

555
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,690
ah

556
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,510
hahahaha

557
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,730
yeah they just wanted to escape

558
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,290
ah

559
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,190
hahahaha

560
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,690
he should know about it

561
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,610
he should know about it

562
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,730
he should know about Sewell Park

563
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,210
and the winter solstice

564
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,610
I said men cried

565
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,230
babies died

566
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,250
children fell

567
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,110
people were hurt

568
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,770
they died

569
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:29,990
I said men cried

570
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:29,990


571
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:29,990


572
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:29,990


573
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:29,990


574
00:36:30,010 --> 00:37:00,010


575
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:30,010


576
00:37:30,010 --> 00:38:00,010


577
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:23,490
it was Si Uncle Brother

578
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,590
but they didn't get hurt

579
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,290
so I hurt them

580
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,070
Such as father

581
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,230
what a tough

582
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,250
aquarium

583
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,990
sang sunset

584
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,110
And there were like the shape and form of a vortex in every way

585
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,310
And out of the whirlpool came great shining ships of the sky

586
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,670
And their shape was like a two-leaf

587
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,130
And yet no way were they of a being like nature

588
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,190
And they meant me the greatest heart

589
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,230
And as they came to me with great malice I felt safe

590
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,910
I saw a great wonder

591
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,150
The smoke of the great pipe of the sun covered me

592
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,190
And the great ships of the sky could not pass through

593
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,010
And I fell on my face before the glory of Bob

594
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,650
I found myself in a long hall hung with many lights

595
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,110
And the light they cast was like the faded fireworks

596
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,590
The haze of too much fear

597
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,450
And a voice called me saying

598
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,890
Is this, is your sign

599
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,790
Your guidepost for the coming winter times

600
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,610
I asked, is this a message

601
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,770
Or is this just some dumb meaningless body dream

602
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,730
What's this green purple

603
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:55,030
What's this green purple

604
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,250
Ah

605
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,230
Yes, dear friends, that was the Swingin' Love Corpses,

606
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,010
the amazing Swingin' Love Corpses from St. Louis, Missouri.

607
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,490
And let me see now, I could, I could

608
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,030
play the beginning of the Swingin' Love, see,

609
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,290
last, that was another thing I thought about doing this week

610
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,150
was having the Swingin' Love Corpses show.

611
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,350
They were in town on their world tour last week

612
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:26,810
and they gave us the only interview that they gave to any radio station in town.

613
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,590
And I've got a whole hour and a half's worth of it

614
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,790
but it needs to be edited down, I haven't had a chance to do it

615
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,470
so why not run a little bit of the Swingin' Love Corpses.

616
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,890
I know there's a lot of Love Corpses fans out there.

617
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,010
Don't, just because you're into the Swingin' Love Corpses

618
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,310
and Prairie Squid and all that,

619
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,290
please don't hang yourselves while listening to Swingin' Love Corpses tapes.

620
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,710
They've, there's been this outbreak of teenage suicides.

621
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,590
You know, they, they, they, they listen to Love Corpses tapes.

622
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,850
And they want to be Swingin' Love Corpses.

623
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,930
And they, they tie themselves up like that and get to dangling.

624
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,170
And, and friends, that's a one-way trip, baby.

625
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,470
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses interview.

626
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,390
This is a preview.

627
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,770
Let's call this a preview of the Swingin' Love Corpses interview.

628
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,510
What is this one coming up?

629
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,610
Let's, let's, let's bring this, bring this up.

630
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,190
No, no, that might be our instructional techniques tape.

631
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,910
Nope, nope, it's not that one.

632
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:27,870
Well, this is from, uh...

633
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,810
You understand your hypnosis tapes have been very successful.

634
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,570
Yeah.

635
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,490
Your sleep tapes.

636
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:32,790
Right.

637
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,410
The teaching and...

638
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:34,690
Earn while...

639
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,690
What are the courses available?

640
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,730
Earn while you sleep.

641
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,290
Earn, earn and learn while you sleep tapes.

642
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:40,910
That was...

643
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,490
The series has been very successful.

644
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,730
Yeah, I understand the positive thinking.

645
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,090
And we had frat while you sleep.

646
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,750
Smoke cigarettes while you sleep.

647
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,330
We were actually into the...

648
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,950
You can accomplish anything while you sleep.

649
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,970
Sleep 18 hours a day.

650
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,470
Uh, pyroflagellate for the other six hours.

651
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,710
Uh, praise Bob.

652
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,770
Praise Bob.

653
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,850
So, what are we listening to now?

654
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,390
This isn't Le Petit Mane's Disciples.

655
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,250
This is, uh...

656
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,690
African Love Rhapsody?

657
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,830
Or is this the zen of corporate butt kissing?

658
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:21,110
No, this is, uh, from Le Petit Mane's Disciples right here.

659
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,830
It's, uh, it's a cut from side two.

660
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,070
It's called, uh, Poop Dog Hat Part Two.

661
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,590
Oh, okay.

662
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,150
And, uh...

663
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,810
Very shortly we'll be getting into...

664
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,150
This is Brazilian influenced.

665
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,570
I understand this is influenced by Brazilian voodoo music.

666
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,870
Mm-hmm.

667
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,050
And I understand you've had many experiences with Haitian voodoo.

668
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,810
That is correct.

669
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,850
And Haitian diseases.

670
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,410
And Dr. G. Gordon Gordon was, uh...

671
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,790
Yes, of Curry Squid fame, friends.

672
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,410
You heard him last here on...

673
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,770
Curry Squid, formerly of Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.

674
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,330
That's right.

675
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,050
Another great doctor band.

676
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:58,970
Um...

677
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,930
He happened to be in town.

678
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,630
He happened to be in town, uh, for a few days and, and...

679
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,890
So, the Dr. G. Gordon Gordon sat in?

680
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,330
He knew we were cutting a new album in the studio.

681
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:11,490
I bet you guys were doing it.

682
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,190
And so...

683
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,970
How about Curry Squid?

684
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:13,430
I guess being...

685
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,470
He came on down there and...

686
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,910
Being rich and, and, uh, famous rock stars, now you have the, the Curry Squids brought

687
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,630
to you, right?

688
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,250
You don't have to go out and catch them.

689
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,570
Yeah, they, they bring them to us.

690
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,650
Does the record company, uh, do you have any records?

691
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:26,670
Uh, we have, uh, we have a record company.

692
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,670


693
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,670


694
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,670


695
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,670


696
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,970
2 že Kenắn et al

Wackyly, 환 αυτό.

699
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,870
our own variety.

700
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,370
Well, I've always preferred

701
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,530
to just plain old raw prairie squid

702
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,090
than any special

703
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,710
prepared prairie squid.

704
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,550
I would have, you know,

705
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,250
your fans all think that

706
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,250
you always get the Russian

707
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,790
spiny squids and

708
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,470
the arboreal squids from Jamaica

709
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,150
and so forth, the

710
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,510
sloth squids.

711
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,050
And, I mean, come on.

712
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,850
You can...

713
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,250
For history's sake, you know, what kind of

714
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,770
squid does...

715
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,750
What kind of prairie squid or

716
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,750
prairie kind of mollusk like this?

717
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,810
I know I'm going to disappoint a lot of people.

718
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,710
A Mississippi River Valley squid.

719
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,830
I'm going to disappoint a whole lot of people.

720
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,530
Just local stuff.

721
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,950
Squid is squid, man.

722
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,970
I like it all.

723
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,590
It doesn't make any difference to me.

724
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,530
Any kind of squid is good squid.

725
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,930
And they've got the biggest

726
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,990
fluters, man. I'm not kidding you.

727
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,730
They just hang right out there.

728
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,290
The Missouri squid.

729
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,990
Fluter squid.

730
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,910
Yeah, well, no, those are

731
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,410
the freshwater

732
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:42,910
aquatic squids.

733
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,690
I mean, they're...

734
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,650
They can hang them fluters, though.

735
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,010
They hang the fluters right out of there.

736
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:49,550
I'm kidding.

737
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,530
I mean, I understand that

738
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,530
fluters gets hard.

739
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,910
I've heard that you'll do a prairie squid

740
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,150
without me beating you.

741
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,390
And he'll do it in about five minutes, too.

742
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,830
That's the word that gets around in the rock and roll press.

743
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,870
And he'll do it in about five minutes, too.

744
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,650
Without me beating you.

745
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,870
That's what I call an overman.

746
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,090
A true overman.

747
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,970
But you know what I can say?

748
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,790
It's kind of like the name of this next song.

749
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,110
But we don't...

750
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,230
We do not recommend that anyone in our audience

751
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,750
attempt to utilize a prairie squid

752
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,110
without me beating you.

753
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:27,910
That's the way it is.

754
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:28,910
It reminds me of the name of the song.

755
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:28,910


756
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,490
If this is a prairie squid,

757
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,250
it's right here.

758
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,910
Ooh!

759
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,850
Oh, hey.

760
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,810
Oh, hey.

761
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,150
Oh, hey.

762
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,290
Oh, hey.

763
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,150
Oh, hey.

764
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,270


765
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,270


766
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,270


767
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,670
Oh, hey.

768
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,810
Oh, hey.

769
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,170
Oh, hey.

770
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,970
Oh, hey.

771
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,950
Oh, hey.

772
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:24,390
Oh, hey.

773
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,250
Oh, hey.

774
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:25,770
Oh, hey.

775
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,350
Oh, hey.

776
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,070
Oh, hey.

777
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:28,850
Oh, hey.

778
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,870


779
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:29,850
My hand

780
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,250
It's my, it's my hand

781
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,250
It's my hand

782
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:37,990
My hand

783
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,150
My hand

784
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,530
It's my hand

785
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,590
My hand

786
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,910
My head

787
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,430
My head

788
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:13,730
My head

789
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:24,010
My head

790
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,130
My head

791
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,890
Hey, appa hey佐!

792
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,190
My head

793
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:36,270
My head

794
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:36,270


795
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,330
My head

796
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:39,810
My head

797
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:39,830
My head

798
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,850
My head

799
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,090
My head

800
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:54,570
It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my, it's my, it's my life.

801
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,050
Ooh.

802
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:57,730
Ooh.

803
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,810
He said we don't usually cut through the bubble.

804
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,090
He's got a scream for attention.

805
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,710
He's got a problem.

806
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,370
He's got a problem.

807
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:24,070
And all I want to know is how come it's my, it's my head.

808
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:25,930
Ooh.

809
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:28,770
Ooh.

810
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:29,550


811
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:29,830
Ooh.

812
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:31,530
Ooh.

813
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,490
Ooh.

814
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:33,510
Ooh.

815
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:33,850


816
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:34,110
Ooh.

817
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:34,750
Ooh.

818
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:35,870
Ooh.

819
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,290
Ooh.

820
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:37,610
Ooh.

821
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:37,610


822
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:37,610


823
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:37,610


824
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:37,910
Ooh.

825
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,550
Ooh.

826
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:47,570
Ooh.

827
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,410
Ooh.

828
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,150


829
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,250
Ooh.

830
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:04,830
Ooh.

831
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:04,990
Ooh.

832
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:05,290
Ooh.

833
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:05,330
Ooh.

834
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:05,370
Ooh.

835
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,150
Ooh.

836
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,870
Oh, yes, dear friends, it's just my head.

837
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:29,370
That's a mighty Swingin' Love Corpses tune, friends.

838
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,850
That's the Swingin' Love Corpses.

839
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,050
Dr. Philo Drummond, Corporal Sphinx Drummond.

840
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,170
And a special vocalist on this one.

841
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,250
The G. Gordon Gordon.

842
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,450
Ah, yes.

843
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,670
I hate to pot down on that one.

844
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,670
Friends, I'll tell you what.

845
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:06,130
Oh, yes, dear friends.

846
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,350
The American Indian version of Amazing Grace.

847
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,750
I heard this earlier today on KNOA.

848
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,750
The Beyond Boznero Show.

849
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,970
The Baha'i Show.

850
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,810
Anyway, let's...

851
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,650
Friends, I've just had three phone calls begging,

852
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:31,070
begging for the place to write for information on the Church of the Subgenius.

853
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,670
And where to find out more about Bob,

854
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,970
the Good Sex for Mutants Dating League,

855
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:35,890
the...

856
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,590
and how to get slack.

857
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:41,190
How to get slack off of Bob for nothing.

858
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,110
For nothing.

859
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,770
And you can write for information, friends.

860
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,730
You've got those pens and pencils and computers ready.

861
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,770
And that postage stamp.

862
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,230
You can write to Bob, dear friends,

863
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:58,070
at P.O. Box 140306.

864
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,430
That's right.

865
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,310
P.O. Box 140306.

866
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,970
In Dallas, Texas.

867
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,190
Mighty, mighty Dallas, Texas.

868
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,370
The headquarters of Bob.

869
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:15,090
At the zip code of 75214.

870
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,130
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

871
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,230
Dallas, Texas.

872
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:22,590
75214.

873
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,050
And you can write for information on the many, many products.

874
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,150
You know, these tapes are...

875
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:33,970
But, well, we can't get into advertising on this public supported station.

876
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,890
We're going to be begging you for money just for this.

877
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,170
The stations start next week.

878
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:42,670
I say no, yeah.

879
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,310
And then say, yeah.

880
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:58,590
The earth no longer lay nor

881
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,170
far away.

882
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:04,850
Yeah.

883
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:12,150
They're remember, yes, plot

884
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,310
for profit.

885
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,950
Look here.

886
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:32,170
More than free training program is offering transportation, basic skills training, and GED preparation.

887
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:42,930
Dear friends, support services and vocational training in air conditioning and refrigeration, automobile service and repair, cable TV installation, office careers, paint and wall covering, and home health aid training.

888
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,110
And they pay you $5 a day just to learn these skills.

889
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:55,750
So if you're 17 to 21 years of age, a low-income resident of the city or county of Dallas, and a high school dropout, call 746-2492.

890
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,230
Call now. That's 746-2492.

891
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,950
Now let me see if I can get Rebby Sharp's lovely record going here.

892
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:04,830
Eh?

893
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:11,870
This is Green Streets by Rebby Sharp, also with the orthotonics.

894
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,870
Whew. I believe we have to go a little bit faster.

895
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,890
Huge liners passing tires, water shrinks to burrows.

896
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,830
Breakers hardly breaking, fishery just to show us.

897
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,530
Holes with an opening, craters.

898
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,370
On the sides, Admiral Byrd was ranting.

899
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,390
Flying far inside, meat grew 11 feet around.

900
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:36,370
Bacteria walked on two planets, tilting on faulty X's.

901
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,990
But he forgot to chew.

902
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,330
Driving ladders from the south.

903
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,830
Driving ladders from the north.

904
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,270
Ah, it's going to run with caution.

905
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,110
Crawling to the source.

906
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,870
The land inside was thriving.

907
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,510
The outside layered dying.

908
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,550
Coated towns of authorities.

909
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:14,610
Turned truth to myth by lying.

910
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,850
Green bars beneath the strata, morning tones of color.

911
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,770
Rounding sky in layers.

912
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,190
For your blanket round the other.

913
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,650
Mobile ears filled with mud seed signals.

914
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:25,710
For your blanket round the other. Mobile ears filled with mud seed signals.

915
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,390
Ext nearest molecules gloss below.

916
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,030
Waldened by rocking gasses.

917
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,350
Apples grew up in rows.

918
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,270
Butterflyyer returned to theiliz

919
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:48,330
Ah, it's going to run with caution.

920
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,070
Crawling to the source.

921
00:54:52,070 --> 00:55:08,090
The land inside was thriving, the outside lay a-dying. Coated tongues of authorities turned truth to myth by lying.

922
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:15,950
Huge liners passing fires, water trucks to pause. Breakers hardly breaking, fish we used to shoot.

923
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:21,950
You see the poles with an opening, craters on the sides. And the word was ranting,

924
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:29,370
Far and far inside, far and far inside, far and far inside, far and far inside.

925
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,390
Well, dear friends, actually that wasn't Green Streets, that was a Hollow Earth song.

926
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,350
They must have printed that record with the doohickeys on it.

927
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,070
Let me see if I write it.

928
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:38,570
Here we go.

929
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,490
Listen to that sound of slack, friends.

930
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,210
Stay tuned, by the way, for Soul Oldies coming right up.

931
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,970
Meanwhile, to this day I don't know who sent us this cassette.

932
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,750
This was sent by someone here in Dallas.

933
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,770
It's a lovely Bob song coming up here, but I don't know who did it.

934
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,950
If anybody out there does know or did this thing,

935
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:07,810
please, look,

936
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:08,250
call,

937
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:08,970
and let us know.

938
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,010
823-7490

939
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:12,610
Music

940
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:16,930
Music

941
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,470
Music

942
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,010
Music

943
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,970
Bob, hoax me in the eye with love.

944
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,350
Think about it.

945
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:55,230
Who was the last guy to say to you these words?

946
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,170
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

947
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,070
Who?

948
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:08,410
I say, don't trade Bob for eagle stamps.

949
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,330
Bob, hoax me in the eye with love.

950
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,610
Bob, hoax me in the eye with love.

951
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,930
Bob, hoax me in the eye with love.

952
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,090
Take a rubber chicken to lunch.
