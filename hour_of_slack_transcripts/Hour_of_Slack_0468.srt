1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
Oh, yes, dear friends, can you imagine how a negroidal subgenius must feel when listening

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,720
to a bunch of Caucasian humans arguing about the bell curve?

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,440
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,100
powerhouse.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,820
What?

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,940
Yes, and let's just go directly to the new Negative Land CD.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,680
This is Negative Land, Time Zone's exchange project.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,640
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing, my friends.

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,780
Executive Window will bring you information more quickly and concisely in a form suited

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,000
to your leadership role.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,740
Using symbols and color codes augmented with sound and motion, your Executive Window will

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,980
communicate the status of projects and corporate measurements of interest to you.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,900
Radio Moscow World Service presents Sidewalk Survey.

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,200
Your hosts, Paula Garb and George Morzin.

15
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Hello, everybody.

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,520
Hello.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,660
Lately, we've received letters asking about what people in this country know and think

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,980
about the various riddles of the world.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
The world's most important and most important things are the things that scientists are

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,240
working on.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,260
Well, for instance, the Bermuda Triangle, unidentified flying objects, various lake

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,600
monsters, and last but not least, the so-called Abominable Snowman.

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,740
The Abominable Snowman?

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,800
Just by way of explanation, this so-called snowman is called Sasquatch in Canada, since

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,700
that's what the local Indians first named the beings they claim to have come across

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,600
for centuries.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm standing right down here at the open door of the ship.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm not sure if you can see me.

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
There's a memo to Mr. Friday.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,680
Dr. Oslo, Norway, Dean of Psychiatric Broadcasting, Universal Media NetWeb.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:19,260
Dear Mr. Friday, I am sitting now in my private quarters at the World Advertising Towers listening

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,380
to the tapes that just arrived of your departure for Radio Moscow.

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,700
I know that you won't hear this until you return to Holland.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,360
And by that time, your negotiations should be complete and successful.

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,380
I want to congratulate you and all the people on the team there on the island for a job

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,600
grandly done.

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,920
As I listen to these tapes of your departure to the Soviet Union, I am filled with pride

45
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,920
and admiration for the...

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,400
the...

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,260
the...

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,360
the...

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,440
the...

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
extent of...

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,360


52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,120
of careful consideration for the future of the world that you bring to bear on this project.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,180
The Time Zones Exchange project, I think, will rest in the annals of media history on

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,160
a bed of nails.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,360
That's right, it will never be popular.

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,020
It will never really reach the kind of popularity that, say, I Love Lucy did, but I believe,

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,340
especially in documentary areas, it will never be popular.

58
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:37,480
is to begin with we will gain a great deal of needed respect i don't mean to say that

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,180
note to my secretary the memo began to go a bit astray from my original plans

60
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:57,200
there and some negativity began to creep in please delete those implications

61
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:07,000
we're about 15 feet as i listen to you climb into your p38 and take off from that beautiful island

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,960
i can only hope that

63
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,980
note to my secretary i have the tapes from howland on freeze frame at the moment at a very

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,620
interesting section

65
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,720
it appears to me that mr howard hughes was on the island at the time of mr friday's departure

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,080
uh would you please look into this i understood that mr hughes was dead

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:49,380
you'll find him appearing in a white shirt to the left of the p38 at frame 6014 6014

68
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,040
i believe that's the first image of him

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,020
oh where's that unlock code

70
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,780
oh yeah there it is okay let's see what this says

71
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,700
oh

72
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,320
good to go mr red

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
what's going on

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,060
Now, I'm not permitted to reveal what year it is here now, of course, but let me assure you, a lot has happened since you died.

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Mr. Friday is presently vacationing out on the Crystal Wheel, but his 20-20 hindsight seems to only improve when he's off-planet.

76
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,440
I have just received an urgent authorization from him, so scrap whatever you had lined up. It's not going to make any difference to the future.

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,380
If you'll check your auto-schematics receiver, you'll notice we are feeding you a test wave mix, which is to be broadcast tonight.

78
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:13,000
Now, as you know, test wave mixes are sent directly to Radio Moscow through you, creating an intercontinental simulcast, complete with receptacle phone input from both countries.

79
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,760
This test wave is especially designed for the Soviet population.

80
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,420
It has perhaps already occurred to you that while the old order of Soviets arrived,

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,040
the Soviet society has been dumped, there has been virtually no practical preparation in Soviet culture to replace it with what they said they wanted.

82
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:46,340
From our vantage point here in the future, Mr. Egg, we need to quickly insert the functional aspects of a free-market economy into the collective Soviet mentality to avoid the approaching chaotic derailment of their economy in your time.

83
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,600
You know, learning to buy is easy. They must learn how to sell.

84
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,420
If this works, and Mr. Friday is right,

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,340
if the Soviet society is confident it will,

86
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,420
it will immediately open all the Soviet republics to the unhindered distribution and sale of Mertz,

87
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:10,840
which in turn will change their decision to prevent Pride Hall Labs from mining the Mertz enhancer chemical, Cephysate, which will soon be discovered in that big crater in Siberia.

88
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,820
And with the exclusive rights to Soviet Cephysate, Pride Hall will swamp the future synthetic competition in metal supplements,

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,220
providing the funds now necessary to finally corner the ice mining market

90
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,080
by buying the Braided Ring of Saturn.

91
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,940
And then, well, oh, forgive me, Mr. Egg, I'm telling you more than you need to know.

92
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
Sometimes I'm like a kid in a history store.

93
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, in your time frame, Mr. Friday is now in Radio Moscow in his capacity as director of the Time Zones Exchange Project for UMN.

94
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,020
Let's see, oh, one more thing.

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,080
Mr. Dickie Diamond was originally informed that he would host this Cast Wave broadcast,

96
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,200
but Mr. Friday now tells me he has kept it.

97
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,980
He's canceled Diamond as host, so don't let him in the studio.

98
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,120
No matter how popular he is with the public, we can't risk the future of Pride Hall on a space-brained loose cannon like Dickie's.

99
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:13,420
Okay, good luck, Mr. Egg. I'll talk to you again soon, and, uh, say, if you play the stock market, perhaps I can give you a few tips.

100
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,380
We have very accurate stock listings covering your next few years.

101
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Oh, but, uh, I guess if this Cast Wave succeeds, that'll probably all be worth it.

102
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,780
I'll change, huh?

103
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,540
Well, closing transmission now. Please lock and recode.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,440
Well, who am I to say? I hope they know what they're doing.

105
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,460
Who's this?

106
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,280
UMN 1 to studio. UMN 1 to studio.

107
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:40,960
Hello?

108
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm next.

109
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,520
This is Dickie Diamond, star of stage, screen, and satellite.

110
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,360
Dickie.

111
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,760
Ha ha ha! And I've got your damn whirlycopter! And I'm not coming down!

112
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,360
Never!

113
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:08,260
Dickie! Dickie! Dickie! Dickie! This is Mr. Egg. What happened? Bring that whirlycopter back! We've got a herd traffic at six!

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Shut up, Egg!

115
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,100
Chief of auto-schematics!

116
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,060
Dickie, Dickie!

117
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,060
Will somebody explain why you're making all those premium credits?

118
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,300
What the hell is auto-schematics, Edge?

119
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:30,540
I don't even answer! The whole thing is a pathetic hoax designed to keep the duds and ditch the diamond!

120
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,920
Don't you think I know what you know that I know what you and Friday are up to?

121
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,480
Dickie! Dickie! Dickie! Calm down! Calm down! You're still the biggest draw we've got, Dickie!

122
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,040
The netwap is not going to cut the line!

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,040


124
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,340
You're going to get me out of there, medium pie! You understand, Edge?

125
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,180
Dickie, Dickie, we had no intention of...

126
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,040
Ever since my Dancing on the Moon special was rated lowest in the sphere, you've been insuring me out!

127
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,660
How was I to know that gravity and rhythm are linked?

128
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,580
And now...

129
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:12,740
Now it's anything for diamond, anything for diamond, nothing for diamond!

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,340
Well, my career is not ending here!

131
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,100
Of course not!

132
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,820
Not at all! I'm not over the edge yet!

133
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,660
Listen to me. Slap yourself together! What are you doing?

134
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:31,060
I've had it with bony netwap types leading me on with dramatic promises and then delivering what?

135
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,900
What? Improvisation!

136
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,520
Bah! Yish! Yish! Yish! I hate improvisation!

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,060
And now...

138
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm going to do the worst thing anyone could do to you!

139
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,320
Don't do it, Dickie!

140
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,020
Don't do it! Don't do it!

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm going to use this script...

142
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,740
And I'm going to take your listeners away!

143
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,820
He's got a script!

144
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,040
Ha ha ha!

145
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,780
You have no defense against a script, do you?

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,540
Ha! A real plan!

147
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,860
Dickie, listen...

148
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,900
Remember the media shifter, Edge?

149
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,220
The media shifter?

150
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,940
It's right in front of me. Quite the gimmick. Very expensive!

151
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,600
Listen, diamond...

152
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,340
The blind pulls...

153
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Dickie! Dickie! Ha! Ha! Dickie, come on! Ease on down!

154
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,000
Shut up, Edge!

155
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm going to use this media shifter to remove your listeners!

156
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,440
Wait a minute, Dickie!

157
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,760
Remove them to your biggest competitor!

158
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,260
Wait a minute, Dickie!

159
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,940
Ha ha ha! And they'll stay there, Edge! They'll have to stay there!

160
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,160
Dickie...

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,320
Ha ha ha!

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,640
Listen, Dickie, I don't know what you're up to, but...

163
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,080
You ready? Power is red! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it!

164
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't do it! Don't do it!

165
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,220
No, we know count is up! Electron factor! Ten to the seventh power!

166
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,100
Dickie! Dickie!

167
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,720
Jump cycle in!

168
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,740
Don't touch that button!

169
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,620
High filter on! Counting down now, Mr. Edge!

170
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,040
Ready?

171
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,020
Listen, listen to reason, Dickie.

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,500
You can't do this!

173
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,560
Dickie, we've got a pilot for you, Dickie! We've got a big pilot for you!

174
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,640
I can fly this myself! So long, net web! Try to find yourself in the ratings now!

175
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,700
Dickie! Dickie! Ha ha ha!

176
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,160
Let's go!

177
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,360
Don't do it!

178
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,020
Not in words with me!

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,900
Only one.

180
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,460
But back to Friday, I must not be so easily diverted.

181
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,080
Oh, no kidding, man.

182
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:02,860
And yes, dear friends, that last 11 minutes and 38 seconds was from the new Negative Land CD,

183
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:11,820
which is Time Zone's Exchange Project, a beautiful double CD.

184
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,000
And who knows, we may be running tons and tons of that material for your pleasure.

185
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,780
Your pleasure here on the Hour of Slack from our good friends at Negative Land.

186
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
And I should give you their address.

187
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,580
Friends, you got that pencil ready?

188
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,480
Eh?

189
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,860
If you want information on Negative Land's many CDs and cassettes,

190
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,340
write to, and this is one word, okay?

191
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,680
Negative Mail Order Land.

192
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,380
Negative Mail Order Land at 109 Minna Street.

193
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,560
Just take off that street part.

194
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,980
It just says here, 109 Minna, M-I-N-N-A, number 391.

195
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,420
109 Minna, number 391, San Francisco, California.

196
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,960
And that zip is 94105.

197
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,680
Yes, after having their very lives almost destroyed by Island Records, U2, and SST Records,

198
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,260
these valiant audio slack masters and creators of their own medium have not only tenaciously pumped out,

199
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,080
astounding new album after album,

200
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
much of the material, like in this case, taken from their radio shows,

201
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,680
Over the Edge, there on KPFA in Berkeley,

202
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,520
but have formed their own record company co-op

203
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,220
to help themselves and other artistes get distribution

204
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,020
without a single record company vampire involved.

205
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,720
And believe you me, the Church of the Subgenius

206
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
is going to benefit.

207
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,760
From that very thing.

208
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,000
It's over the as soon as I get any kind of a break,

209
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,860
I need to sit down and start compiling the Hour of Slack CD series

210
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,960
to be done in conjunction with Negative Land.

211
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,300
I yes, dear friends.

212
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,180
Oh, by the way, in the in the background,

213
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,680
we're hearing music by an obscure band.

214
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,100
Well, maybe they're not obscure to you.

215
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
I just hadn't heard of them.

216
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
Until recently called Osric Tentacles.

217
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,360
There they go.

218
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,540
Osric Tentacles.

219
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,620
It's so psychedelic.

220
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,540
Anyway, I bet you can't tell from where you're sitting,

221
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,700
my friend.

222
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,540
But from where I am, this particular show is late, late, late.

223
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,600
I should already have duplicated the 14 copies

224
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,720
and be sending this show out right now instead of just now starting to produce it.

225
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Oh, no.

226
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,280
Now, why is that preacher Reverend Stang always making excuses, you ask?

227
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,060
Well, now, because of being ensconced here at the apex of the very church,

228
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,420
just a few notches below Dobbs himself.

229
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,420
My excuses are actually pretty exciting.

230
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,080
And this time it's not our new book, Revelation X.

231
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,460
That's all done.

232
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,300
And we're just doing PR stuff now.

233
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,240
In fact, by the time you hear this,

234
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,060
you may very well already have your copy in your hot little hands or claws or pants.

235
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,300
Thin sabes are here for adventures.

236
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,540
They print that mighty book on November 18th,

237
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,140
and the official release date,

238
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,400
okay, the date they pick to indicate when they think it'll start hitting stores,

239
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,360
is, get this, November 22nd.

240
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,380
You can't say Dobbs doesn't love you now, Jack.

241
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

242
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,180
Revelation X, the Third New Testament.

243
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,720
The New Third Last Testament, one might say.

244
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:11,080
a Simon & Schuster publication will be out there for all to see and bask in, for better or for worse.

245
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,880
And my excuse is not this time that I've been running around preaching on car hoods and sleeping in flea-bitten motel rooms.

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,360
That'll be my excuse next month.

247
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,160
But I should probably mention those now.

248
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,920
Two big subgenius devivals in December.

249
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,820
December 2nd in Cleveland, sponsored by the Flying Lemur bookstore in Lakewood.

250
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,680
The mighty Flying Lemur, which sponsors this show on that adorable station, WCSB.

251
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:49,880
And I don't have the exact location yet, but you can call, you Clevelandians, there at DNA Level C.

252
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
You can call the Flying Lemur.

253
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,040
And,

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,560
and,

255
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,320
you got that pencil ready?

256
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,100
That number is

257
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
216, of course.

258
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,480
221-2535.

259
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,860
221-2535.

260
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,380
That's a nice devival coming up on Friday, December 2nd.

261
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,000
And maybe Indian Rope Burn will play also.

262
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,920
And then a week later, we've got the Philadelphia devival.

263
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,940
December 9th at a real church this time.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,560
It's been turned into a nightclub.

265
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,840
And, which is called The Church.

266
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:37,540
And that devival is spansored by Pastor Craig Roll, who hosts the Hour of Slack and his own show on mighty WKDU.

267
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Do you do that?

268
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,600
And we'll feature yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, as well as the terrifying Dr. Katahdin Legume.

269
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,400
And the great Father Joe Mama.

270
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,600
And the Beatles.

271
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,860
The Beatles!

272
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,860
No, I'm sorry.

273
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,360
I mean John Bartles.

274
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,260
John Bartles.

275
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Not the Beatles.

276
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,420
Uh,

277
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,480
uh,

278
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,780
dues paying ordained members will be getting postcards about these shows.

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,040
Now,

280
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,860
but,

281
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,680
my excuse, friends,

282
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,400
my excuse of this week partakes of none of those, nay,

283
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,420
but, uh, in the fact that I've been surfing the internet.

284
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:20,020
Yes, the subgenius foundation can now take on the role of global village idiot on the information,

285
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,240
super highway.

286
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,620
I've finally hooked up the modem that Dr. Drummond gave me and got an America online account.

287
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,880
And I'm just waiting for my free internet access special account to come through so it won't be costing.

288
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,740
So now, friends, when I give the sacred P.O. box number at the end of the broadcast for information about this church,

289
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll also be giving the church headquarters email number.

290
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,000
And you ordained members,

291
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,120
will be glad to know that now that we've managed to get a handle on the technology and learn the geeky jargon,

292
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,400
what we're mainly working on is the stark fist of removal church magazine online.

293
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,240
Yes, I mean, we got to work on it anyway.

294
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:16,620
And I'll be dumping the magazine in progress onto alt.slack on the internet and tweaking it and adding to it interactively with everybody else there.

295
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
And when it's all done, we'll publish it on paper for everybody else.

296
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,860
Who doesn't have their very brain linked to a computer and modem yet.

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,900
Now, my friend, let me backtrack and explain to ye who have not yet tried to cross that information super highway.

298
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,760
For many indeed are the virtual dead dog corpses dotting the sides of that highway.

299
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,960
Now, one week ago, before my crash course in nerd speak, I was barely aware of all this.

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I can sympathize if this already sounds like a bunch of crap.

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm not sure if I'm talking about the

302
00:20:51,560 --> 00:21:07,920
As you probably know, the internet is this invisible place like heaven or hell where people can leave electronic junk lying around for each other to fish out.

303
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,580
Now, mostly it's text messages and programs, although with enough know-how and gear, you can send and receive art and sound, etc.

304
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,920
And I mean, eventually we'll all have them in our shirts.

305
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:19,980
And I mean, eventually we'll all have them in our shirts.

306
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,180
And I mean, eventually we'll all have them in our shirts.

307
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,180


308
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,060
And I mean, eventually we'll all have them in our pockets or embedded in our heads.

309
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,420
But there's already millions of humans plugged into the internet all over the world.

310
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,380
And it breaks down into thousands of categories.

311
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:49,980
Now, in the category called alternative, which is where most of the weird stuff happens, there's a special mini-network among all the others called alt.slack, or alt.slack, depending, which is where the subgeniuses have been leaving messages.

312
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,840
For thoughts on alt.slack and which is where the subgenius code is being stored and then those callers have to leave messages to one another for several years now.

313
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,780
And there are several thousand messages sitting in it right now.

314
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,960
And there are also other subgenius electronic meeting places on other networks besides the internet,

315
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,800
like, for instance, America Online has a Church of the Subgenius board located under their so Elizabeth Cornelius

316
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,040
Subgenius Board under the Philosophical Matters heading in their hobby department called The Exchange .

317
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:19,960
But, alt.slack on the internet is, for now, probably the most used and used and used in the Christian automatically on the Internet.

318
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,460
subgenius dump. Now I don't know who started alt-slack and nobody's

319
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,780
moderating it. In other words, it's an endless series of unrelated topics being

320
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,500
discussed and it's also cluttered with topics that have been automatically and

321
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,860
senselessly dumped in there from other nerd networks. So when you first start

322
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,360
looking for the interesting slack-imbued material on there, you're met with total

323
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,120
chaos and the equivalent of thousands and thousands of pages of garbage that

324
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,740
has nothing to do with the church or the war against the conspiracy for that

325
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,040
matter. You're also met with some of the lamest subgenius wannabe geekliness

326
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,380
imaginable. It's kind of like wandering around a comic book convention. And since

327
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm, you know, Mr. Famous Guy subgenius, when I made my presence known there I was

328
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,340
additionally greeted by a bunch of nerds. I was also met with some of the most

329
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,640
recent

330
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,960
lurking some keen individuals indeed. And the potential for the whole thing is

331
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,920
practically infinite. Now Dr. Drummond and I have been developing a plan and

332
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:55,580
we have no intention of hobbling the chaotic, what most of us would call lame,

333
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,740
idiotic, childish blabbering by those so-called subgeni who have no lives.

334
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,120
Now we do, however, plan to give the newcomer an alternative to all that by

335
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,880
creating new clearly marked categories which, taken all together, will comprise

336
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,920
and represent introductions to the church and, in fact, the stark,

337
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:27,060
stark fist of removal church magazine in progress. In other words, if you enter alt.slack

338
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,380
on the internet you can go straight to where the most recent few hundred messages are and

339
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,000
you'll find categories that were started by us here at the Subgenius Foundation but

340
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,720
which are also being constantly updated and added to by others. We can only hope that

341
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
this works. We're just now starting.

342
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,660
For instance, here's some of the organizational categories that would

343
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,600
comprise the online stark fist or I guess you could actually call it the

344
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,400
online hour of slack. There'd be an intro to Bob for newcomers, an intro guide to

345
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,180
alt.slack, official church news, reviews of other mutants and high weirdness

346
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:16,740
updates, you know, wonderful magazines, books, CDs, tapes you can get, so forth,

347
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:25,980
videos, upcoming devivals, current hour of slack stations and times, practical anti-conspiracy

348
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,880
weaponry, classic subgenius rants, new subgenius rants, letters, prayers and confessions, suggestions

349
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,960
and requests, classic tales of Bob, new tales of Bob, a dissent, evil gossip and flaming,

350
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:46,200
bummers, etc. and it would all be free. Of course, this would be kind of like the naked

351
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:53,420
stark fist because there's no art and we can't do italics or boldface, you know, so

352
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:00,860
the accents don't come across quite the same. But it would be free. And again, we have no

353
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,340
intention of corralling alt.slack or cleaning up the chaos, so to speak. We wouldn't dream

354
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,480
of it even if we could. We merely want to put little islands of useful organization

355
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,180
into it for those of us who don't really have the time or money to wade through the

356
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,440
randomness. And you may be saying now, Reverend Stang, even if I had a computer and a modem,

357
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,000
I wouldn't be interested in messing with all this computerese jargon and Bobby Blather.

358
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm a subgenius, man. And I'm just not going to do it. So why don't you shut up and all

359
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,920
that stuff and just play some damn tapes. Okay. Okay. We're going to do that.

360
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:54,980
Okay. Okay. Slack. Slack. Just wanted to let you know what else is out there in the realm

361
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,340
of the church, which is actually a pretty big realm. I mean, this is a religion, so

362
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:10,080
it touches on every possible area of life, death, and a lot of the mess in between. What

363
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,520
else is out there, you know, besides this show and the books and the comic books and

364
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,700
the tapes?

365
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,580
And so forth.

366
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,440
Only one.

367
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,960
Back to Friday, I must not be so easily diverted.

368
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,820
Oh, what was that again?

369
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,200
The Friday family belonged to an uncommon theological order. The Sandemanians, they

370
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,740
were called.

371
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,080
Oh, I...

372
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,680
In his later years, and indeed throughout his life.

373
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:52,800
Friday thought that men of science were given to higher moral feelings than other men.

374
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,700
Well, Mr. Thomas, how does that statement jive with page 13 of your biography here,

375
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,260
where you state that the Sandemanians were a lusty sect of sun worshipers and that young

376
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,720
Friday would spend hours hanging upside down and naked in his backyard reading pornographic

377
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,580
Sandemanian texts, reportedly found in a crashed alien pod by Dr. Sandemanian himself.

378
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,180
And what did he say?

379
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,360
What did he say of his reading?

380
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:26,800
He said this, it made me think, it made me think, the connection with a good book has

381
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,200
no equal in how it can turn a mind.

382
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,980
Well, let's hope that's not always true. But beyond his massive sexual appetite for misshapen

383
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,980
physiques, what can you tell us about these supposedly alien electrical experiments which

384
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,820
were illustrated in these Sandemanian books?

385
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,280
Friday was already engaged in doing some experiments he had read about in the books.

386
00:28:51,420 --> 00:29:00,980
And he said, I made such experiments as could be defrayed in their expense by a few pence

387
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,600
a week.

388
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,400
But what was the nature of these...

389
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,120
Isn't that just wonderful to hear?

390
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,360
Yes. Well, now that he owns half the world, it's hard to believe he started out on such

391
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,100
a shoestring.

392
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:23,920
Friday wrote, I am now constantly employed in observing the works of nature and tracing

393
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,500
the manner in which he directs the order and arrangement of the world.

394
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,080
Now, what do you suppose he meant by that?

395
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,100
Order and arrangement of the world.

396
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,840
I see, sort of a vast world vision that would probably...

397
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,620
And this phrase, order and arrangement.

398
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,200
Yes.

399
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,640
By that he meant the great scheme of things in nature, order and arrangement.

400
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,440
Well, with just a few minutes left, I'd like to get back to...

401
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:01,080
Now, Friday heard of this event, that electricity makes magnetism.

402
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,420
And in his notebook he wrote, make magnetism produce electricity.

403
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,380
Make magnetism produce electricity.

404
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,800
The year was 1820.

405
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,740
Uh, wait a minute.

406
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,180
I don't even have to take off my shoes to figure that would make him, let's see, 1820 to 1900.

407
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,780
That's 60 plus, I don't know, what is it now?

408
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,640
For 11 years he labored on the idea, make magnetism produce electricity.

409
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,600
And make electricity produce slack.

410
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,240
Ah, yes, dear friends.

411
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,500
Well, we'll zone out now and go back to the discussion of Mr. Friday on slide two

412
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,180
of the...

413
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,580
Your subgenius radio minister, however, thank you.

414
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,340
So, let's see, 1820 plus 11, that's...

415
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,320
In 1831, the discovery was unfolded.

416
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,680
Ah, yes, yes.

417
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,620
And that, of course, must have been that famous first probe into the mysteries of trans-infiltration,

418
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,140
which killed all those assistants.

419
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,760
But, uh, Mr. Thomas, in the short time left, can we move on to the...

420
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,060
I am busy just now on electromagnetism.

421
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,060
I think I have hold...

422
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,080
and the

423
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:39,040
which Friday replied,

424
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,560
Mr. Minister,

425
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,140
one day,

426
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,940
you may be able to tax it.

427
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,120
Huh. Tax it.

428
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,620
One day you may be able to tax it.

429
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,160
Tax it.

430
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,400
Isn't that a wonderful reply?

431
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,400
Super reply.

432
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,740
But now, was this prior to the patent laws

433
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,920
that now give him exclusive usage rights

434
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,760
over that technology?

435
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,320
And at that point in time,

436
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,180
how could he have foreseen...

437
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,260
And on another occasion,

438
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,720
a lady put the same question.

439
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,920
Of what use is it, Mr. Friday?

440
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,760
And he replied,

441
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,380
Of what use is a newborn baby, madam?

442
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,800
Indeed.

443
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,240
Sometimes I still ask myself that one.

444
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,860
And I also wonder how Friday,

445
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,440
at such a young age,

446
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,580
was creating all these things so long ago

447
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,540
as if he could understand

448
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,640
what the future would...

449
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,500
So now, when you see the huge transmission lines

450
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,700
stretched across the land,

451
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,200
and when you visit the huge generating plants

452
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,740
that are in the air,

453
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,820
where falling water gives birth

454
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,120
to the electric fluid

455
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,840
which lights your home

456
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,220
and toasts your bread,

457
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,140
and when the day turns dark

458
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,920
and the darkness is turned to light

459
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,540
by a million neon flames,

460
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,720
think of Friday,

461
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,740
that little boy born to a blacksmith

462
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,820
who gave to the world

463
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,500
this enormous gift of his genius.

464
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,440
Super genius. Super genius.

465
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,340
But tell us about all that wealth.

466
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,600
I think most...

467
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,560
People want to hear about all that money.

468
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,140
And so he had to decide.

469
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,900
Make money, gather wealth,

470
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,380
or serve science and mankind.

471
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,220
His decision, we can already guess.

472
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,920
I guess so.

473
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,360
And he spoke ever constantly in this refrain.

474
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
The sweetest reward of my work

475
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,260
is the sympathy and goodwill

476
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,960
which flows to me from all quarters of the earth.

477
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,000
Wishful thinking there.

478
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,700
Great and wonderful characteristics.

479
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,620
The most prominent, I would say,

480
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,220
must be his sense of order

481
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,920
and his humble heart.

482
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,740
Of his many utterances,

483
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,360
this stands nobly among them.

484
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,380
For the philosopher,

485
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,960
truth adds industry

486
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,320
within the veil of science, he said.

487
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,500
It is a glorious school for the mind.

488
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,260
And this phrase,

489
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,960
there is nothing too wonderful to be true.

490
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,380
Is that true?

491
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,100
Nothing too wonderful to be true.

492
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,080
Just kidding.

493
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,900
Well, we are right out of time, Dr. Thomas.

494
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,140
So, uh...

495
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,740
So I say,

496
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,400
it would be good for boys to get jobs like this today.

497
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,400
Well, I'm sure they'll try, Mr. Thomas.

498
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,740
You mean like...

499
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,320
Remember, too.

500
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,840
Ben Franklin was an errand boy

501
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,280
and an apprentice to a printer.

502
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,500
You will remember I told about that.

503
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,260
Yes, I do remember, Dr. Thomas.

504
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,920
And thank you.

505
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,860
Thank you very much.

506
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,620
Thanks for that.

507
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,060
I think that was a great insight

508
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,520
into the early years of C. Eliot Friday.

509
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,480
We've been talking with Delmar Detmer Thomas,

510
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,900
the one and only authorized biographer of C. Eliot Friday.

511
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,600
As we continue here on the Piddlediddle Report

512
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,100
with our topic for tonight,

513
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,200
C. Eliot Friday and the Soviet connection.

514
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,700
I must say,

515
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Mr. Thomas must be quite a draw

516
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,500
because, uh, our ABS audience meter,

517
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,780
indicating how many of you are tuned into us,

518
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,400
took a giant flying leap into the really big numbers

519
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,720
right in the middle of that issue.

520
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,420
interview. Well, glad to have you aboard, and I know you'll want to stay with us as these historical

521
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,040
events in the Soviet Union continue to develop, and we explore the mysterious role of C. Eliot

522
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Friday, the world's most mysterious tycoon in these events. We'll be back with more right after

523
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,940
these messages. This is the American Broadcasting System.

524
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:47,020
Diet recommendation for subgeniuses? Well, now, actually, in the book of the subgenius, it says,

525
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:55,640
oh, some granola in the morning, and then three martinis, and then some nice, you make a sandwich,

526
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:02,860
you take some sprouts, you know, some organically grown sprouts, and some of that peanut butter

527
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,360
that's...

528
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,840
You get in the health food stores, the kind with the oil on top. Yeah, and your grandma's face,

529
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,480
and make your sandwich. And now, that's for lunch. Then for dinner, you would maybe eat some rusty

530
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:23,080
nails, and stuff some frop up your exit wound. That quote, that sort of thing, when we give

531
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,060
directives and admonitions of Bob in our books, those are really, oftentimes, believe it or not,

532
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,920
those are meant humorously. Because Bob would...

533
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,520
Well, never...

534
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,520
No subgenius is going to give you orders. Well, actually, I shouldn't say that. A subgenius may

535
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,660
give you orders, but no subgenius ever takes orders from any other subgenius. We would give,

536
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,440
for instance, the conspiracy would tell you what's healthy to eat, what you should eat,

537
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,000
what you should watch on TV, and who you should vote for. We're not going to tell you any of that

538
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,560
stuff, aside from the obvious, J.R. Bob Dobbs for World Overlord. But for all we know, as powerful as

539
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,920
he is, he's going to give you orders. And we're not going to tell you any of that stuff, aside from

540
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,100
the obvious, J.R. Bob Dobbs for World Overlord. But for all we know, as powerful as he is, he may

541
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:14,860
already be World Overlord. Praise that man, Bob. I hate Bob. You can't imagine that Bob can...

542
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:21,600
Bob hates you so much. He doesn't even know you, but he hates you. He hates you. You can go to bed

543
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,540
at night all alone and think, well, I'm not completely alone. Bob's thinking of me. He hates

544
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,420
me. But only if you send him that $20, friends, which goes up to $30, by the way, when the new book

545
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:45,120
comes out in, well, it's supposed to be in November. What? Right, Bob doesn't care. He hates you

546
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:52,700
anyway, but he also loves you. You know, Bob is, it's like good and evil are one thing when you're

547
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,160
on that level. It's all, I mean, Bob, one minute he might walk a little old lady across the street,

548
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,040
and the next minute, beat her to death, club her to death, and take her money. It's,

549
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:11,180
it's, it's whatever gives him the most slack. For all we know, now this is not likely, it's possible,

550
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,160
it's not likely, but it's possible that Bob is, where is he? He's not here right now. He could

551
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,760
be meeting with Dan Quayle to prepare a new retrovirus release, a new, quote, accidental

552
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:30,080
release of another warfare, biological warfare germ. He could be doing that. That doesn't seem

553
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,820
like a bridge subgenius could even imagine Bob doing. But here's the point. If he does, so be, so be it.

554
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,760
It is not up to us to question Bob. You do not question, you don't use your mind to think about

555
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,280
your religion. It's as simple as that. You, I mean, the minute you drag logic and reason into any

556
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,200
religious sort of thing, that's the end of it. You might as well just go join the Moonies, the

557
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,920
Catholic, you know, the, they are one of those other subgenius spin-offs. Oh, yes, the young little boy,

558
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:11,840
over there with the, Bob said it. No, actually, the correct line is, Bob sold it, I smoked it. That settles it.

559
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,220
Oh, well.

560
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,840
Well, now that depends. Actually, the soul, many, many people think that the soul is located in the

561
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,720
gonads. Actually, it is in the, now,

562
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,420
this sounds like a play on words, but the human soul, S-O-U-L, is in the foot, along with the S-O-L-E

563
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:46,340
type soul. And like that other soul, it's a rectangular, greenish, flat thing. However,

564
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,880
what most people don't know is, like the rhinoceros horn, it is actually made of hair.

565
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:59,520
It's like the fingernails or something. That's, that's right. The soul is down there.

566
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,900
It's all proof, man. It's like, they look for,

567
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,320
scientific proof. Well, we'll offer $50,000 to anybody who can prove that J.R. Bob Dobbs does not

568
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,240
exist. That offer has been standing for 10 years now, and nobody's taken us up on it.

569
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,720
Now, this is, we're getting into the ram of the, the, the angels on the head of a pen type question.

570
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:29,780
What is Bob's shoe size? Actually, Bob wears size 12 Brogan's. That is a doc, that is a question

571
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,880
that is addressed doctrinally.

572
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,100
Bob has eaten a great deal of spam. Bob was in World War II.

573
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,220
Bob, Bob, no, let's not do, let's not do Monty Python stuff. Oh, wait, next it's going to be

574
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,280
Rocky Horror Picture Show fans. It's going to be Doctor Who fans. Or, or, or Mystery Science

575
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:02,760
Theater 3000. That was the Nissan Bob. That was a rip-off. Yeah, he's referring to the,

576
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,260
the, the, the spate of commercials in conspiracy media that feature cute Bob-like characters,

577
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,500
often called Bob. The best one is the Nissan spot where you just, it's point of view shots out of

578
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,760
a windshield of a Nissan, and the signs all say, yield to Bob. You know, this lane is Bob's.

579
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,540
He starts to get a ticket from a cop, and the cop says, oh, it's you, Bob. And at the end of the

580
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:32,020
spot, they show the car and a little slogan that says, why should rich guys have all the luck?

581
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,300
That is an example of the conspiracy. And you can watch for this kind of thing. The conspiracy

582
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,000
has a special, you know how they have a UFO study group and so forth? They have a subgenius study

583
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,280
group that, for all we know, may be more important to Bob's plan than any of us. But they, the

584
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,980
conspiracy does try to cutesy Bob up, deliver a, a, this sort of a understandable Bob, a silly Bob

585
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,600
that's only a takeoff on silly televangelists. And, uh, they're trying to serve you, Bob,

586
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:02,740
on a whole new level. And they're trying to serve you, Bob, on a whole new level. And they're trying

587
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,180
to serve you, Bob, on a whole new level. And they're trying to serve you, Bob, on a whole new level.

588
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,180


589
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,740
silver platter. And the day that Bob Dobbs becomes popular, that is the day to start worrying about

590
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,760
this because I guarantee you, those of us who were in there at the beginning will have gone. We will

591
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,000
be gone. We may have taken the money and run, but someone else will be running it. And on that day,

592
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,560
my friend, that is the day to fear when they start selling you church air for one soul per breath.

593
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,340
Oh, and you laugh. You think that's funny. I've, I've seen these things.

594
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,720
You can read on the internet, all kinds of stuff about the church of the subgenius. I've heard the

595
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,360
other, Oh, there's all these geeks on the internet. I tell, they know all about church of the subgenius.

596
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,920
The Reverend Ivan Stang is just a fake name for a consortium of 50 writers in, uh,

597
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,620
Texas or no in Canada. That was the latest one. Yeah. The Canadian false Bob. Oh, there's a

598
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,500
smiley face, Bob. You can actually buy CDs by Jake, by Bob Dobbs. He's afraid to call himself

599
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,060
Jr. Bob Dobbs or put it in quotes or anything like that. No, it's in Canada and it's like

600
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,820
costs more than they've ever, they'll ever make. Yes.

601
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:30,640
Oh, pastor Craig friends. Here it is. Pastor Craig, pastor Craig here from the Philadelphia,

602
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,320
uh, subgenius radio.

603
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:44,680
Show. This is the, uh, CD, the CD, uh, which is your Babs media ecology. It's the funny,

604
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,080
it's the intellectual Bob. He's a little more serious and he is as much more trendy McLuhan

605
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,140
ask words so that you can really know that it's, it's like not that silly Texas stuff.

606
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:15,580
Dr. Levinguba is just spiked, the pathetic, the wannabe, the gimme Bob, the one of the Aquaman.

607
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:24,620
Bob psychotic. Thank you. Pastor Craig for that amazing contribution there.

608
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,300
I've always wanted to do that. WFMU did that to that guy's albight, send it back to

609
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,460
him.

610
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:29,820
.

611
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,380
Yeah,

612
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,880
it back to Bob Dean, the false Bob.

613
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,480
I just noticed among the shards there are two pills on the ground.

614
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,620
I'm not going to take these pills.

615
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,460
Because I know what's in them. Those are health food store or convenience store speed.

616
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,220
You know those

617
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,380
zippy pills and so forth that you see at the convenience store?

618
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,100
I don't know about you, but ephedrine just doesn't cut it for me.

619
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,120
And caffeine in the form of go-to cola just ain't...

620
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,000
It just ain't there. It doesn't do the trick.

621
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,460
We like to steal the world. We're the only way.

622
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,320
Well I'm getting...

623
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,780
Frankly,

624
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,460
I believe in Slack

625
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,000
for myself

626
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,120
and Yoko.

627
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:34,720
And uh...

628
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,560
We would like to uh... I would actually just as soon listen to

629
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,460
this amazing rendition of uh...

630
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,620
Sunshine of Your Love by Jimi Hendrix.

631
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,960
On the radio for the rest of the afternoon.

632
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,900
This is the American Broadcasting System.

633
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,580
I'm so depressed, Andrew.

634
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,280
You can't be depressed. This is the holiday season.

635
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,100
But America's losing its values, Andrew. I just read it in the paper.

636
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,940
Nonsense. I spent my lunch hour at Hastings and believe me, there are plenty of values there.

637
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,900
Andrew, I'm talking about something much more far-reaching.

638
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,680
I doubt it. The values I saw at Hastings reached to just about every gift item you can imagine.

639
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,880
Sweaters, dress shirts, neckwear, sports shirts, outerwear jackets, camel hair sport coats, suits, casual slacks, and more.

640
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,180
Andrew, this is deeper.

641
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,420
Deeper? I don't think you'll find a much deeper value than $32.90 for a soft lambswool sweater

642
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,780
or $12.90 for a beautiful silk tie.

643
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,280
Andrew, I'm talking about human values.

644
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,460
Well, then you're talking service. And there's not another clothing store with a more helpful staff than Hastings.

645
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,240
Real professionals.

646
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,920
But Andrew...

647
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,860
Friendly, unhurried atmosphere. Real holiday spirit.

648
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,920
Andrew, we're just on different wavelengths.

649
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,160
That's because you haven't been to Hastings yet.

650
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,680
One store where you can find great holiday gifts at great holiday prices.

651
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,800
Well, I guess that is bad.

652
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,120
Yeah, you...

653
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,560
Kinda restores your faith, doesn't it?

654
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,320
Only in America.

655
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,680
Only at Hastings.

656
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,260
This is the Piddle Diddle Report.

657
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:10,600
A five-hour, in-depth report on current issues of substance.

658
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,340
All right. We're back and with more on tonight's C. Eliot Friday and the Soviet connection.

659
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,720
Tonight's report on the Piddle Diddle Report.

660
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,540
I'm Doug Piddle.

661
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,020
My colleague, Peter Piddle, is away on assignment to Howland Island in the Mid-Pacific.

662
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,460
And we hope to have a direct phone link to him shortly.

663
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:41,000
Of course, Mr. Friday reclusively resides on Howland Island, where he maintains headquarters for his many enterprises.

664
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:47,820
Most notably, the Universal Media Netweb, now the largest international multimedia glomerate in the world.

665
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:54,760
And, uh, Frydol, his pharmaceutical lab, which has been distributing free Mertz tablets in the Soviet Union for months.

666
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,300
Heh.

667
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,220
And I can't be the first one to wonder if they had some effect on current events there.

668
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,620
And we've all heard the various rumors regarding Mr. Friday's role in beginning and then ending the recent Soviet coup attempt.

669
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:18,740
It has been alleged that it was a walnut-sized prototype Frydatronics micro-mini-video cam, which Gorbachev used to record his denials while a captive in the Crimea.

670
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,660
We all saw what he held up at his press conference, wrapped in a hanky to cover the brand name.

671
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,860
What's more, there appears to be a lot of evidence that the company is in the middle of a crisis.

672
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,540
And we've heard that there's going to be a great deal of security surrounding some kind of scientific testing going on at Howland Island right now.

673
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,520
And we also have reports that many Soviet media officials are now on the island.

674
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:43,300
Could this involve the mysterious trans-infiltration device we've heard so much about, now being developed by Frydatronics?

675
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,420
Is Friday on the island at all?

676
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,360
We heard his flying wing left Howland several days ago, taking the polar route towards Russia.

677
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,860
Is he dead?

678
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,640
No one's heard or seen the man in over six years.

679
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:04,240
Well, we're going to try and find out these and other things occurring before and after you hear this.

680
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:14,040
Peter Dill should be calling us soon with his report on the spot from that tiny dot so isolated that it isn't even in any time zone.

681
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,940
And in fact, I think this is his call coming in now.

682
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,520
Let's check that right here.

683
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,980
Peter Dill.

684
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,380
Peter, are you there?

685
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,920
What time is it?

686
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,660
Hey! Where did he land at? Just a second here.

687
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,420
It's fabulous. It's fabulous. It's all green. It's beautiful. It looks, it's gorgeous.

688
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,320
What are you going to do next, Peter?

689
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,220
I don't know, but with these new pills, it'll be easy to make up my mind.

690
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,280
Okay. Well, listen, we...

691
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm going to look for some of those Soviet officials, I guess.

692
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,360
Oh, hey, hang on, Peter.

693
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:47,760
Okay.

694
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,920
Hang on. Don't go away.

695
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,960
Listen, the console is indicating we have...

696
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,980
We have a very special phone call here.

697
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,360
Could you hang on a minute?

698
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,500
No trouble?

699
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,760
We have a telephone call.

700
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,340
Telephone call.

701
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,740
Just a moment, Peter. Let me adjust the scale.

702
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,040
All right. Go ahead with that call.

703
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,600
...into the space network from the White House.

704
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,340
Oh, my God, Peter. This is very special. Listen to this.

705
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,640
We would like to patch them through.

706
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,300
All right. Go ahead.

707
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,540
If you would, please, Mr. President, go ahead.

708
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,460
I think your trip is just going to ignite the excitement and the forward thinking for this country,

709
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,900
so I really just wanted to call up and wish you the very best.

710
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,340
It's God-forsaken lush green foliage out here. It's right...

711
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,400
...on top of my face.

712
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,360
Oh, really?

713
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,760
Can you hear Mr. Bush all right?

714
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,240
I'm... I'm glad I got this.

715
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,860
Wait. He's still on. He's still on. Mr. Bush, are you still there?

716
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,460
Well, that's what... I couldn't understand that. I...

717
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,680
Yes. Just a moment.

718
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,140
No.

719
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,640
You thought he was a calm guy out there, you know, and now look at him.

720
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,080
How are you going to do that?

721
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,780
It's great talking to you, and I'll let you go back to work. What's the next thing you've got to do?

722
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,060
That's what I was wondering.

723
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,900
Move forward, I guess. I voted Democratic, you know.

724
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,260
Oh, that's great. I'm sure it'll go well. Sitting right behind my desk is that model you gave me down there,

725
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,340
and also the picture of you two guys, and it was... it was there before this phone call, too.

726
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,740
Oh, how about that, Peter? Great deal.

727
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,320
May I address the vice president?

728
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,480
He cut out.

729
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,480
I think it probably attributes the fabulous and magnetic qualities of your personality

730
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,500
supported as extensively as I can attempt to do with my personality.

731
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,500
Wouldn't you... wouldn't you think?

732
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,440
Oh, Peter, your signal's all jamming up now.

733
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,500
It's in March, I think.

734
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,360
Oh, it's on this end.

735
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,460
Everything looks very great.

736
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,300
Peter.

737
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,000
Peter!

738
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,020
Well, Peter has faded out there.

739
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,520
That happens occasionally on these shortwave cellular phone transmissions.

740
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,620
I'm sure he'll be back later. He's got our number.

741
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,000
And my God, things are a little strange tonight, folks.

742
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,860
Uh, kill the ocean, that's one thing I'm still in command of.

743
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,980
You're listening to the Piddlediddle Report.

744
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,460
Peter Diddle, of course, you just heard out on Howland Island. Do it again.

745
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,700
I'm sure he's doing a grand job making his way up towards those lights, hopefully.

746
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,280
If he can hear me, towards the lights, Peter.

747
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,020
Let's go to a message right now and come back and continue as usual.

748
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,460
This is the American Broadcasting System.

749
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,780
Uh, yes, dear friends.

750
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:47,440
Uh, that was Negative Land, their new CD.

751
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,620
Um, actually, it's a double CD set.

752
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:58,440
Uh, it's, uh, Negative Land presents some, some best of from their over-the-edge radio show,

753
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,240
The Time Zone's Exchange Project.

754
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,140
And I'm gonna give, uh, that, uh, address to write to for more information for a catalog of Negative Land products.

755
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,020
I've got that Benzel ready.

756
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:17,420
Write to Negative Mail Order Land, 109 Minna.

757
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,680
That's M-I-N-N-A.

758
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,900
109 Minna, number 391.

759
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,100
In exotic San Francisco, California.

760
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:38,520
And that ZIP code is 94105.

761
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,320
94105. Well, we're just swimming in code tonight, aren't we?

762
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,520
Uh, yes, we...

763
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,400
The Church of the Subgeniuses.

764
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:53,320
This has gone online and, uh, off the wall and over the edge and, uh,

765
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,400
Hell, why not?

766
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:05,380
Um, while I'm at it, I suppose I should give the, uh, sacred post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius, yes?

767
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,800
This is the place to write.

768
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:14,220
Drop us a postcard or a self-addressed stamped envelope for information on other subgenius information.

769
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,360
Ahem.

770
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,220
And that number is...

771
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,640
You know, that's not the kind of music that you want to put in the background when you're given the sacred post office box.

772
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,540
That number is, dear friends...

773
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,980
Hey, that music's even worse.

774
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,500
There we go.

775
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,360
Okay, uh, the post office box is...

776
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,600
Well, just write to Bob.

777
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,580
Uh, he ain't gonna read your letter.

778
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,980
But, uh, I will.

779
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,160
Maybe.

780
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,400
Uh, just address that to Bob at postofficebox1.com.

781
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,640
1-4-0-3-0-6.

782
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:55,380
That's box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

783
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,900
75214.

784
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,760
And now, as promised...

785
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,340
Oh, by the way, that zip code once again was 75214.

786
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,540
Dash 04.

787
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,840
No, it'd be dash 0306.

788
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,520
That's right.

789
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,480
Technically, all you'd have to do is write,

790
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,740
Bob, 75214-0306.

791
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,260
And it would, uh, get here.

792
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,340
Cause they know.

793
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,480
Yes, over there at the mighty P...

794
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,800
Those P.O. buckers at the P.O. know.

795
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,260
They see all and they know all.

796
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,380
But they don't tell all.

797
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,120
Um, and, uh, but I'm gonna tell you the email address.

798
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,940
As promised, you can email the church now.

799
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,940
And, uh, it's one word.

800
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,000
One nice long string of words.

801
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,920
SubGStang1 at AOL.com.

802
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm gonna go through that this one time.

803
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,940
It's S-U-B-G S-T-A-N-G.

804
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,840
Numeral 1.

805
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,540
That's SubGStang1.

806
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,080
That's all you need if you're on America Online.

807
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,860
But for everybody else, it's SubGStang1 at...

808
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,920
You know, the little A with the circle over there.

809
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,740
AOL.com.

810
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,460
America Online Communications.

811
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,860
And, uh, you'd be surprised.

812
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,060
I sit up every night and go through the mail.

813
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,180
As one subgenius out there said, or on there said,

814
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,280
it's like a P.O. box that never closes.

815
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,920
And your wife and kids or husband and children,

816
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,120
and kids sit and wonder why you sit and peck away

817
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,160
at that little box, that evil box that the conspiracy can...

818
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,760
You know, they can monitor everything we say and do.

819
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,060
But you know, friends, I mean, I'm so...

820
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,560
You see, all these poor folks on the internet are complaining about censorship

821
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,700
and they can't advertise or cuss.

822
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,760
I've been under those limitations doing this show for all these many years.

823
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,660
And it's just...

824
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,500
It's something, in a way, I...

825
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,100
Of course, we intend to dismantle their evil system.

826
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,280
But for now, you have to look at it as sort of a challenge, you know?

827
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,380
You have to invent your own new cuss words and eviled code words and so forth.

828
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,060
Well, anyway, enough of that.

829
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,420
Let's let the show go out.

830
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,060
This is Osric Tentaclesmore in the background.

831
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,700
Um...

832
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:44,000
Let's listen to Dr. Howell on the puzzling evidence.

833
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,640
Show.

834
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,660
That's what he calls it now.

835
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,460
Um, this particular tape, I'm not sure what it's gonna be, but I know what it's from.

836
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,920
It's from Phineas Narco's, uh, uh, compilations of that show.

837
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:05,500
You can, uh, get information about a catalog of the KPFA subgenius show from Phineas Narco.

838
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,140
Uh, and his address is post off...

839
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,020
You got that pencil, Rick?

840
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,000
Post office box 1247.

841
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:13,980
Uh...

842
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,580
P.O. Box 1247 in San Jose, Ca-la-fornia.

843
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,440

844
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,080
Or finn at west dot dark side dot com.

845
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,680
Okay.

846
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,520
What, what, what, what, what, what?

847
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,720
And is it consistent with the small-minded law of the people?

848
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,300
Yes, and with the Small Mind Administration, which has officially certified it with the house-shrinking seal of approval.

849
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,780
And here on the side, right under that, are the...

850
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,620
Well, this is interesting. It's the ingredients.

851
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:55,560
Uh, it says, U.S. certified sludge, water, sucrose, muscimol extract, ibuprofen, muscazone, dimethyltryptamine, serotonin, natural sludge flavoring.

852
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:04,660
Contains 1 40th of 1% gabofrop, an artificial mood enhancer, which should be used only by those who must restrict their intake of ordinary humor.

853
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,860
Caution, product may be habit-forming.

854
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,000
Do not operate radio while taking this medication.

855
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,960
Do not operate heavy farm machinery at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour.

856
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,120
Do not attempt to explain yourself to others.

857
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,880
Maintain aspect of normal human. Consult your sub-physician or any doctor. The air condition persists.

858
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,820
Okay, well, this looks like the stuff. So I'm gonna take some right here on the show.

859
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,760
Oh, oh no.

860
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,260
Yep, here goes.

861
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,040
Okay.

862
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,160
Oh my god.

863
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,980
Boy, it's...

864
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,520
That's better.

865
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,860
My god, it's incredible.

866
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,100
I've started a boing cycle, caller.

867
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,800
Oh my god.

868
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,960
This has never happened before.

869
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,920
Stop it. Stop it.

870
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,200
I think I'm going to be sucked into the world of boings.

871
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,320
The world of nothing but boings.

872
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:51,880
The boing dimension.

873
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,800
It's right behind you, Mobius. The world of boings that we could be internally trapped in.

874
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,580
If we don't watch out, there'll be nothing on the show but boings.

875
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,800
How do you get some of this stuff?

876
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,620
Well, I told you what was in it. You can rip up a batch yourself.

877
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,020
But I don't know half of that stuff.

878
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,420
It's a free sample in each package.

879
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,660
Oh, oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

880
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:19,820
Oh, no, get those. Oh, the boings. They're too much. Too much boing. Too much boing.

881
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:20,720
I...

882
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,620
Oh my.

883
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:27,420
No.

884
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,800
Oh, that one was wonderful.

885
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,800
Need a towel?

886
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,360
No, I threw a towel over it the moment it happened.

887
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,780
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.

888
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,600
The penultimate comedian of all time.

889
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,300
He transcends time and space.

890
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,320
He's a hilarious, hell-raising hypocrite of hallelujah.

891
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,480
It's the Chainer Devourer.

892
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,240
Who's that?

893
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,220
You, man. You. You're on the air. You're a big shot. Make him laugh.

894
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,800
Uh, it's Chainer Devourer. It's Chainer Devourer.

895
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,860
It's Chainer Devourer. It's Chainer Devourer.

896
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,680
Yeah, he's not here. He's always talking to us. And he's tired of us. He wants to talk to you like that.

897
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,260
Okay, now go ahead.

898
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,700
Chainer has the power.

899
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,860
My heart.

900
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,580
He has the power to save you.

901
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,400
He has the power to save everyone in San Francisco tonight.

902
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,040
He has the power to save everyone in California tonight.

903
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,160
I die for his pleas.

904
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:25,060
He has the power. Yes, Die for... The new album from Jane of Hyperclades, Die for Me.
