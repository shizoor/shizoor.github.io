1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,600
What? What?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,180
It's dear.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,100
I'd say you were going mad.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,780
Yes.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,240
The door was open in the vestibule.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,680
I closed it, leaving the stairs beyond in darkness.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,100
Then they know it's time to sleep.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,160
And they sleep.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,940
The Self-Genius Power of Life.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,400
Oh, isn't that terrible?

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,580
Why?

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,820
You see, we found dress to drool in the book.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,340
Huh?

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,260
What was funny about it is that the bitch made 12 glam books.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
That is funny.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,500
Doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,660
Unless you've seen the end of the Atlantic, I guess.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,640
All right.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,080
That's right.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
Please don't go away from me.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,860
Get out of my way.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,020
I've got to go to the bedroom.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,060
Oh, no.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,780
Yes.

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm, quote, untethered to the truth.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,200
That Trump is still in Syria.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,740
It says the Syrian government was responsible.

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,780
The Trump has not yet decided what it will do.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,080
That we are still looking into.

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,060
PR News.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,260
The Trump also attacked Twitter today.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,360
The Dow was 2233, 326739.

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,520
The Trump now says this is PR.

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,540
Colorado was one of the first states to vote to legalize PR News.

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,420
Massachusetts' highest court says PR News has to hand over documents

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,040
related to a state investigation into whether the giant company misled the public

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,680
by the impact of French train drivers on consumers and investors.

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
Hundreds of people staring at a train.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,120
The court showed bias against the giant company.

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,180
Train drivers would not back PR News.

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,080
PR News is still in Washington.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Hello there.

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,940
All of you have heard of mail order obscenity for your entire family.

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,760
I'd like to begin with a flood tide of second-class filth in a depraved manner.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,060
An illustrated, detailed course in PR.

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,060


54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,560
The court has been

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,180
threatening to pervert an entire generation of our wild, flagrant Harvard sociologists.

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,960
The United States Supreme Court has described it as dirt for dirt's sake.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,240
We describe it as dirt for money's sake.

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,960
The subgenius power of slush.

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,160
In the past few years, this depraved filth has become increasingly worse.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,780
Not only in content, but in volume.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
For one reason.

62
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,740
It is big business.

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Profitable business.

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,880
For the mercenary perverts who produce it.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,940
I swore I would never sing again.

66
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,360
Through this material, today's sadists, masochists, psychiatrists, sociologists, and psychologists,

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,420
the military chaplains association of the United States, and every other kind of deviant,

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,860
can be stimulated to slack.

69
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,600
For which he has no legitimate outlet.

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:39,100
This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of bizarre,

71
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,340
but evil, misfit, pervert cults.

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,520
Highly colorful, contaminated, hardcore human buttocks in a perverted manner.

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,740
And thus, the grotesque rubber cigarette for the participant until his utter depravity

74
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,980
is complete.

75
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:05,240
Remember, support the obscenity racketeers by writing to Cincinnati, Ohio.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,160
Yes, dear friends.

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,480
And thank you, Lee Murr.

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,260
This episode, hour of slack number 1,870.

79
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,980
I'm making it real easy on myself.

80
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,540
Because it's just me talking for an hour.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,640
Now, luckily, I already did.

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:25,720
So, I'm going to do it again.

83
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,220
all the talking last Sunday from a specially written sermon I delivered at the 31st Winter

84
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,120
Star Symposium the weekend before Valentine's Day. So since it was part of a public show,

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,360
I wasn't just chatting off the top of my head like a dementia-ridden old man, although I did

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,760
a little of that too. Much of the sermon came from what you might call text jams by me, Dr.

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:00,500
Philo Drummond and Dr. Uncle Onan Canterbite, which I condensed and made more rant-like.

88
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,080
It was supposed to climax with a mass short-duration marriage, but that all ended early,

89
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:15,100
so I read a wonderful rant by Onan at the end. The whole symposium was on Zoom, so I was preaching

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,480
remotely from my desk at Stang Ranch outside Glen Rose, Texas. I wore pants anyway, and I even

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,620
shaved. But you can't hear the audience. It just sounds like a crazy man alone in his room.

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,340
Whatever. Oh, the music in the background here is by Ego Plum. Now, I know last week I promised

93
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,980
more readings from The Agent and Mr. Dobbs by Reverend Teters LaVerge, our new mystery novel,

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,020
but this is more timely and, in fact, starts with a message via time camera.

95
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:02,420
things. I am speaking to you via a time camera. If you can hear my voice, if you can see my face,

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:11,840
then to you it will be the conspiracy year 2022. A terrible disease will be sweeping the world,

98
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,180
and yet half the people will choose death just to prove they're smarter than those who chose life.

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Ultra-patriotic Americans will riot for the

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,160
right to destroy democracy in order to save America from letting the wrong Americans have

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,880
freedoms. Humans will begin noticing that the planet and their own faces are on fire

102
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,820
and will spread gasoline everywhere. The followers of Jesus will switch to loving the rich

103
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,440
and cruel and powerful and hating the meek, the poor, and the lame.

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,380
Millions of people will be afraid of the world, and they will be afraid of the world.

105
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,700
Millions will spend millions on things that definitely do not exist.

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:07,260
Therefore, the purpose of life is to have fun and get slack, and you should strive to be kind

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:14,400
to parents and animals, exercise and eat right, avoid unhealthy food, and above all,

108
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,400
send money to J.R. Bob Dobbs. If you don't send money to Bob,

109
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,360
we won't be able to save you. We won't be able to save you. We won't be able to save you. We won't

110
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,360
be able to perfect this time camera, and this sermon will never reach you.

111
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,540
But you're seeing this, so, well, just send the money and don't think about all that too much.

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,460
The time travel stuff, just don't even think about it. It's just tricky.

113
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:46,280
And if you see me doing this routine again, I mean, if you see another time camera sermon,

114
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,240
just kind of make sure you're in the right time stream. Don't double up.

115
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,500
Just double check. And now we may proceed.

116
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,340
This is the circus of Reverend Stang. We show you things, then you say,

117
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,260
dang. We'll tell you of places you'll never go. We've searched the world, both high and low,

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,660
to bring new slack to this marvelous show. Burma shave.

119
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,200
Recording in progress.

120
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,180
Recording in progress. Recording.

121
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,040
Recording. Everything's going fine. No trouble.

122
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:34,060
Friends, I'm so honored to be at my 31st Winter Star, or Winter Star Ball, I mean, Winter Star Symposium.

123
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,440
There have been more stars than balls, haven't there?

124
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,020
And it says here that I'm supposed to do something called What the WTF?

125
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,920
Newly uncorked revelations from Bob about the nature of X-Day. That's coming.

126
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,020
That will shake the...

127
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,920
foundations of our very houses.

128
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,140
And eventually we'll cover topics about why we didn't know about the dinosaur cities,

129
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,380
gender disabilities and the differently vocabularied, but yawkin' relaxed,

130
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,120
and the parable of the spotted fly, if we get that far.

131
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:17,220
And of course we'll climax it with the traditional short-nuration mass cult wedding, or love-in, or slack-out.

132
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,160
Incidentally, I have no...

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,800
not been paid to say any of the following.

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,460
That's okay.

135
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm just reassuring you of that.

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,900
Okay, Church of the Subgenius. Well, I'm not gonna explain it to you,

137
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:41,720
uh, because you already know, or don't need to, but basically it's like humor, but funnier.

138
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,900
In fact, it would be even funnier than that if we were kidding.

139
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,080
And it's about slack.

140
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,840
And, uh...

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Sometimes it's funny.

142
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,240
Slack can be the work you love doing most,

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,460
but sometimes, I don't know,

144
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,260
sometimes wasting my time seems to be the best use of my time,

145
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,840
if you know what I mean.

146
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,020
And as far as, uh, the word

147
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,780
subgenius, well, we didn't call it Church of the Genius,

148
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,800
if there is a smartest person in the room,

149
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,960
he or she or them probably does not think of it that way.

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,940
We're what you might call differently and smartened.

151
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,580
I've been, uh, spending a lot of time kind of partially disabled,

152
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,260
because of a bad back and broke my toe and a bunch of other stupid things.

153
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,540
Did it all to myself.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,300
But disabled is kind of a bad word now.

155
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,600
People say differently abled.

156
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,960
But subgeniuses are the differently vocabularied.

157
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:48,940
Subgeniuses are the differently vocabularied.

158
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:48,940


159
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:48,940


160
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:48,940


161
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
Subgeniuses are the differently vocabularied.

162
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,620
Even differently sane, in some cases.

163
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,260
Differently normal. That's us.

164
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
We like to think we're not liars,

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,540
we're just differently honested, as it were.

166
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
Differently good.

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm not deaf, I'm just differently hearinged.

168
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,840
And, uh, differently attractive, I guess you could say.

169
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,220
Just like, uh,

170
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,520
when differently inexpensive actually means grossly overpriced.

171
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,100
So, uh, we, the differently new-speaked, as it were,

172
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,280
are really, we're differently woke.

173
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,900
Oh, I'm woke, I'm just differently woke.

174
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,420
I guess you're just differently tolerant.

175
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,940
So the person in the iron lung is fully able, just, uh, differently.

176
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,000
So there's no negative to it, it's all positive.

177
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,960
Toxic positivity, they call it.

178
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,900
It counterbalances toxic asshol-tivity.

179
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,680
I'm sure all of us agree on all this, because we're alternately uniform and equally unique.

180
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,600
That leads us to, oh, the big X-Day excuse.

181
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,940
Uh, uh, revelation.

182
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,340
The new X-Day revelation.

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
Man, I'm not kidding.

184
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,340
This blew my mind.

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,540
It's something that Dr. Uncle Onan Kanabite stumbled upon recently.

186
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,420
It's really major.

187
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,840
And, uh, my mind has never been phylated in this manner, honestly.

188
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,940
It's as weird as the time we discovered that 1998 was also 8661.

189
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,360
We're gassed to the point of flabber.

190
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,380
My friends.

191
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,220
So these, uh, implications are pretty terrifying, and yet they're also hopeful.

192
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,560
Okay.

193
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:01,320
So we know from prophecy that the media will refer to the advent of the angelic host from Planet X as X-Day.

194
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:11,280
But now that we're a lot less certain about what planet this is, necessarily, and what year this is,

195
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,340
the Day of Judgment is now a little bit more obvious.

196
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,160
Uh, a variable.

197
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,460
You know, in, uh, the letter in mathematics that indicates a variable is the X.

198
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,780
Maybe, maybe it's called X-Day because it's variable.

199
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,200
It could be today.

200
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,180
It could be soon.

201
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,380
And we have to live our lives with that variable.

202
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,360
Is today my X-Day?

203
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,300
Is it your X-Day?

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,280
Maybe the X-Day of, uh, everyone?

205
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,900
Or the X-Day of somebody I don't know yet?

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,400
Or haven't killed yet?

207
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,880
What will the future bring, friends?

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,760
Road Warrior?

209
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,300
1984?

210
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,480
Brave New World?

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,140
Uh, Let's Visit the World of the Future?

212
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
Planet of the Apes?

213
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,640
That would be fun.

214
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,460
Life After People?

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,880
That's, uh, all of that's variable, too.

216
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,140
Either way, the Church of the Subgenius offers you the best apocalypse.

217
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,480
The world ends.

218
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,000
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m.

219
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,100
And we don't know when the real X-Day will be.

220
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,780
It's variable.

221
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,820
It might be today.

222
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,540
Might be tomorrow.

223
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,140
But soon.

224
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Soon.

225
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:44,320
This, uh, X equals variable day concept offers spiritual integrity to the notion that one may have a July 5th that isn't necessarily on the conspiracy calendar July 5th.

226
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,960
Uh, just like old Pogo noticing that Friday the 13th can happen on a Wednesday.

227
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,640
Pogo was no fool.

228
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,880
We don't like to use that word, uh, fool or stupid, moron, uh, dipshit.

229
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,700
We prefer the more polite term, subgenius.

230
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:11,400
The first line of the first page of the first subgenius pamphlet says,

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,900
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

232
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,900
Well, no, probably not.

233
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,040
In small print.

234
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,640
People just skip over that, that last half.

235
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,340
That, well, no, probably not.

236
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,380
But it's there in black and white.

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,980
If we can but open our heart chakras to the, uh, vibrations of it.

238
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,020
But, don't you see? This could change everything!

239
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,860
It, it, this, this literally, it's, all the rules are out the window now.

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
It's prophecy chaos theory.

241
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,960
It also means we could, I suppose we could have our big celebration at a less hot time of year.

242
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,920
But, it's like up is down and vice versa.

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
Dogs and cats sleeping together.

244
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh wait, actually, mine do all the time.

245
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,740
Anyway, it's like, like just as 1998 is also 86, 61.

246
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,780
Uh, this whole thing was somehow hidden in plain sight all this time.

247
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,800
How could we have been so blind to it?

248
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,380
Well, because of the conspiracy.

249
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,780
And cataracts, probably.

250
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:31,020
But what is constant and not variable, my friends, is that today is a good day to make your peace or send money to the subgenius foundation.

251
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,580
Often, those two are the same.

252
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,180
Why not both?

253
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,760
The rival cults do not offer such rules.

254
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,740
They offer vagaries.

255
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,340
Millennialism is when your religion says you're important enough to be punished, but not good enough to be forgiven.

256
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,820
It's a spiritual delusion of grandeur.

257
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
A story of how to get to heaven, ending with no ability to do so.

258
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,660
God is a harsh mistress, my friends.

259
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,480
In fact, the most compelling reason to join the church of the subgenius is probably that you'll never be disappointed.

260
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,420
You'll be disappointed at its failure to deliver on impossible promises.

261
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,040
That's us.

262
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,160
The parable of the swatted fly.

263
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:33,260
When I was very, very young, centuries ago, I worked for, believe it or not, Mayflower Moving Company as a moving man.

264
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,540
I was not a very good one because you really need to be the size of a linebacker.

265
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,940
My dad got me the job.

266
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,300
They, of course, were loath to send out little hippie guys on the job.

267
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,780
So myself and the other little or overweight hippie guys ended up sitting around waiting to be sent out.

268
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,000
You know, we were like the last ones picked for the team, you might say.

269
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,860
So we got bored.

270
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,120
This was before phones or television.

271
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,860
And there were flies.

272
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,180
And one of the fellows swatted this fly.

273
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,840
It was sitting on the table in front of me.

274
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,940
And it wasn't really dead.

275
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
It was kind of just doing this.

276
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,760
And I had a Dr. Pepper can with me.

277
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,240
And I thought, that poor thing.

278
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm an animal lover.

279
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,700
And I put a drop of that sugar water, Dr. Pepper, with caffeine,

280
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,160
right up next to the fly.

281
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:47,240
And the fly stuck his or her little proboscis out and sipped some of that Dr. Pepper.

282
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,860
And then it methodically reached down with its little fly legs

283
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,760
and started pulling its entrails back into its abdomen.

284
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,340
I sat there watching this thing.

285
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,920
And it took about 10 minutes for the fly to get its guts back in.

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,280
And he kind of zipped up his belly.

287
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,060
And then he straightened his wings for some time.

288
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,320
He could get his legs all the way back.

289
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,740
I can't do it.

290
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,580
Good thing I don't have wings.

291
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,540
And it stroked its wings until they were flattened out.

292
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,900
And by God, that swatted fly up and flew away.

293
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,260
Be like that swatted fly, my friend.

294
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,960
But of course, it would help if some godlike monster came along

295
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,740
and put a bunch of sugar water and Adderall in front of you.

296
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,500
And magic healing potions.

297
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,760
Maybe some edibles.

298
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,840
Anyway, that's the parable of the swatted fly.

299
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,320
It's amazing how life will go on.

300
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,920
I honestly, I used to, when I was younger,

301
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:08,120
I was seriously worried that nuclear weapons would wipe out all life on Earth.

302
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,920
All life.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,900
Well, I was ignorant.

304
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,560
I did not understand then that there's more life living literally in the rocks,

305
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,780
deep in the mantle of the Earth.

306
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,600
There's so much bacterial-type life down there

307
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,220
that it outweighs all of the creatures on the surface.

308
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,940
And speaking of us creatures on the surface,

309
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,020
big ones like us are really in the minority.

310
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,260
Most living animals are parasites of other animals.

311
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,440
So, bacteria, bacteria.

312
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,100
It's everywhere, friends.

313
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,400
The planet, as George Carlin pointed out,

314
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,280
the planet will be fine.

315
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,680
If you really know your junior science,

316
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,320
and I do now,

317
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,860
the planet will always pull its guts back in

318
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,420
and smooth its wings out.

319
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,620
There'll be, you know, even if every large creature was wiped out,

320
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,220
the equivalent would all come back.

321
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,820
Instead of people, it might be squibbons or squidmen.

322
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,740
There are some wonderful documentaries speculating about

323
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,020
the things that could replace us.

324
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,880
Which could bring me to the dinosaurs.

325
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
But first, I wanted to...

326
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,820
Friends, I saved Texas.

327
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,220
I don't know whether that's a good...

328
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
Honestly.

329
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,840
But apparently, I saved Texas.

330
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,260
You know, last year, right about this time,

331
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,180
in north central Texas, all over most of the state, actually,

332
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,140
there was a terrible freeze.

333
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,120
The worst in a hundred years.

334
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,660
We'll probably have plenty more of them.

335
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,060
Disabled the whole state's electric grid,

336
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,580
which is cocooned and won't share with any other states.

337
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,920
And we, right here at Stang Ranch, in Fossil House,

338
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,740
we had no power or heat for four or five days.

339
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
It was really, really nasty.

340
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,740
It was miserable.

341
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,720
Princess Wee and I had double layers of clothing on,

342
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,380
and coats and boots, in bed, under five blankets,

343
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,880
with two dogs and three cats on top of the blankets,

344
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,120
and then more blankets on top of the animals.

345
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,400
It was that bad.

346
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,340
So this year,

347
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,040
I bought a generator.

348
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,260
Those things cost a lot.

349
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,000
Just enough to run a couple of heat lamps

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,280
and recharge your phones.

351
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,320
Like 500 bucks.

352
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,220
Okay, so I spent this money.

353
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Therefore, by Bob's unsympathetic magic,

354
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,980
the freeze didn't come.

355
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,820
We dodged the bullet.

356
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,600
Had I not bought the generator,

357
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,340
it definitely would have frozen.

358
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,660
A lot of people would have died again.

359
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,820
When I spent that money,

360
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,060
the only way fate could render my sacrifice sufficiently needless

361
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,740
and pointless was to keep the weather normal.

362
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
So in that respect,

363
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,920
by wasting my precious money,

364
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,820
I saved Texas.

365
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,920
Now, your rival cults,

366
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,360
they put the simp in sympathetic magic.

367
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,960
The Church of the Subgenius practices pimp aesthetic magic.

368
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,620
Possibly even pimp anesthetic magic.

369
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,240
But that's hard to say.

370
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,300
Again, whether saving Texas was a good idea,

371
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,900
well, it wasn't really my idea.

372
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,680
It just happened.

373
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
But that remains debatable.

374
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,180
It really does.

375
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,360
This state can be very merciless and cruel

376
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,340
in its laws and things.

377
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,300
So the dinosaurs, I guess,

378
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,260
should have invested in very expensive underground bomb shelters.

379
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,260
Then that big planet killer never would have hit.

380
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,440
The pesky Reverend Pease,

381
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,140
he'll be happy because I got his name mentioned.

382
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,780
The pesky Reverend Pease asked me, personally,

383
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,740
instead of Dr. Howell,

384
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,100
he said,

385
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,820
if dinosaurs lived so long ago,

386
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,620
isn't it possible they had cities and stuff that are just gone?

387
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,600
Because here in Nevada, he said,

388
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,200
I mean, a town can't last 85 years in Nevada.

389
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,500
So it's true.

390
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
70 million years from now,

391
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,780
there will probably be very little evidence of human cities

392
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,680
or machines or anything like that.

393
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,680
This subject has been considered by smart people,

394
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,100
book smart people, I should say, before.

395
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
And plus, it just makes sense.

396
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,960
You may have seen about 10, 15 years ago,

397
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,160
there was a subgenius porno show on television

398
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,600
called Life After People.

399
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,320
Several episodes that had hypothetical situation

400
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,800
of humans suddenly not being here anymore.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,240
Say, some weird virus suddenly Omega-manned the whole world.

402
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,020
Nature obliterates our presence pretty quickly.

403
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,960
Grass grows through driveways.

404
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,440
Driveways and roads and sidewalks.

405
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,400
A discarded chili can might last 100 years,

406
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,280
but eventually it turns into rusty old dust like everything else.

407
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Rust never sleeps.

408
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
That was the slogan of the Akron Rustoleum Company, friends,

409
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,360
mentioned by Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh to Neil Young

410
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,740
during the filming of the insane movie, Human Highway.

411
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,800
Boy, is that one to look at at Thanksgiving.

412
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,580
And hence the album titled Rust Never Sleeps.

413
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,340
But yeah, anyway, after X-Day, give it another million years

414
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,840
and there won't be a single trace left of the human world.

415
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,680
There might, however, be an inordinate amount of human and chicken bones.

416
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,200
Chicken bones found in a very thin layer

417
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,740
representing the relatively short Anthropocene.

418
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,300
The age of man.

419
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,240
It's possible, I suppose, that even little mammals

420
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,040
descended from human remnants

421
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,420
would fit into the niches occupied by vermin currently.

422
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,260
So, nature is so beautiful.

423
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,200
God was so wise before she died.

424
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,500
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

425
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm just kidding.

426
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,080
As a junior scientist, I'm like Einstein.

427
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,600
I believe in God in ways that average religious nut

428
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,320
can't even begin to comprehend.

429
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,360
Because it's...

430
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,760
I can't think that big.

431
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,180
They're too busy watching zombie shows.

432
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,960
Now, Dr. Canabite pointed out that in the zombie shows,

433
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
the horror... the good zombie shows.

434
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,880
The horror isn't the zombies and it's only partially the societal collapse.

435
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,660
The main horror is you don't get to pick who your fellow survivors are.

436
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,020
You're stuck with them, or you're against them, or they're against you.

437
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,540
It doesn't matter if they're useless or stupid or causing problems or bullies.

438
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,500
That's the horror. The real horror is the people.

439
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I had to quit watching that Walking Dead show around season seven

440
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,300
because the people were just too scary.

441
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,860
I couldn't handle it.

442
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,780
There's the people you're stuck with because fate made that happen,

443
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,060
and there's the people who are stuck with each other who want to come and take your stuff.

444
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,980
Speaking of stuck with each other,

445
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,660
I guess I could do the short duration marriage.

446
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,880
And we'll all be stuck together.

447
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,520
Stop right up! Get your holy short duration marriage here!

448
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,280
Test your mettle and win the little...

449
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,080
See, it's a gender thing.

450
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,360
This script was written in 1982, I think.

451
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,920
Win the little lady a sacred certificate.

452
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,940
Man, that's dated.

453
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,420
The little lady has to win me one.

454
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,340
Guaranteed to absolve and sanctify all otherwise illicit couplings.

455
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,960
Free short duration divorce if not completely satisfied.

456
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
That's actually a lie because that's where the money is, the divorce is, you know.

457
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,700
Oh yes.

458
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,520
Beloved friends, voyeurs, jealous associates, and any hidden cameras.

459
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,220
What the hell does that mean on a Zoom meeting?

460
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,500
Do you, insert name here, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, say yes?

461
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,520
Yes.

462
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,160
How long do you wish for this sanctified coupling to last?

463
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,200
Let's keep it at just 24 hours.

464
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,880
We don't want to be stuck with each other, you know what I'm saying.

465
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,500
24 hours is enough for getting a little whatever.

466
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,400
Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

467
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,740
whatever form he may choose to take.

468
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,460
And insert other deity names here.

469
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,860
In this crowd, that's a long damn list.

470
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
I'm not going to go into it.

471
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,680
But all your favorites, including both Marvel and DC, and even Dell.

472
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,160
To join.

473
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,900
This being entity, car keys, wallet, chair, pet, whatever.

474
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:03,780
And this other entity, all other entities present, including, if you wish, car keys, purses, glasses, phones.

475
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,160
The stuff you're losing every day.

476
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,760
Maybe this will help.

477
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,820
We're going to join these people and objects in a temporary,

478
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,820
but no less virtuous, bondage of holy matrimony.

479
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,620
For better or for worse, but praise Bob, not for long.

480
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,460
Do you feel the spirit?

481
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,700
Everybody say praise Bob.

482
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,340
The silent...

483
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,620
Praise Bob!

484
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,380
There's Bob right there.

485
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,180
Christopher P.

486
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,140
Christopher P.

487
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,020
It reminds me of Christopher Lee.

488
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,500
Anyway...

489
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,580
Oh, and put...

490
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,420
Praise Bob.

491
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,520
The script says put your hands on each other.

492
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:46,940
Praise Bob!

493
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,960
You know, normally we'd be in the Beachland Ballroom or something,

494
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,700
and there could be some serious groping.

495
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,560
But now it's just, you know...

496
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,700
Oh well.

497
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,040
At least we don't have to wear masks on Zoom.

498
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,340
So pretend you're putting your hands on each other.

499
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,820
This is a bond of sub-holy wedlock,

500
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,860
so no matter what physical position these beloved may take in the next 24 hours,

501
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,660
their moral standing shall remain upright!

502
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:25,800
And if there are any jealous losers here who feel that these beings and entities and objects

503
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,620
should not be joined temporarily, not even for a mere 24 hours,

504
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,420
just hold your peace. We don't want to hear about it.

505
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,500
And, uh...

506
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:34,960
Oh.

507
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,680
Has... Before we proceed, has the preacher been paid?

508
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,800
Yes.

509
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,900
I have been amply paid.

510
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,980
I have been paid in slack and the joy of seeing my old friends and so many new ones.

511
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,100
That sounds good, doesn't it?

512
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,100
So do you take...

513
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,600
Insert name here.

514
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,640
Take this...

515
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
All these other things, insert all those names here,

516
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,780
to be your lawfully wedded spouse

517
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,820
in short duration, subgenius matrimony,

518
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,080
to have and to hold, in fact, to do just about anything he or she or it agrees to do,

519
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
or them, or...

520
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,420
for richer or poorer, in sickness and kinkiness,

521
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,980
through any hardship or disaster that may befall her and him and them

522
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,380
in the next 24 hours, for whatever sick and twisted, but no less blessed,

523
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,800
reason for the next 24 hours, say, I do!

524
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,240
I do.

525
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,560
And, uh...

526
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Shhh...

527
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,460
Now shake on it and say it's a deal.

528
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,460
Well, it'll have to be the virtual handshake, like the virtual, uh...

529
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,580
Signature.

530
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,360
You know, your e-signature.

531
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,620
Okay, now get out the ring.

532
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,820
If you don't have a ring, don't worry.

533
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,040
The handy temple of Devoe

534
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,100
is almost always available.

535
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,520
Take this ring as a symbol of the holiest state of marriage

536
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,720
and of the shackles, the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,

537
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,700
as well as the pole going deep in the hole repeatedly,

538
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,560
or whatever, however that works.

539
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,900
I lost track.

540
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,640
And now install the rings.

541
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,460
Okay.

542
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,680
On page three.

543
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,840
By the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs

544
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,520
and in defiance of the laws of the states,

545
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,760
any of the states we have to be in,

546
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,480
and of nature, and of mind,

547
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,180
I pronounce you thing, thing, person, person, person, and person,

548
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,300
and pet, and being, and life form,

549
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,560
to be married for the next 24 hours.

550
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,300
You must now kiss each other.

551
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,680
Now see this, we've got to change everything

552
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,280
for this futuristic modern-a-go-go world.

553
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,480
It's awful.

554
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,660
You're now duly authorized and excused

555
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:01,780
for sexual couplings of any perverse, unspeakable kind

556
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,440
for a period of 24 hours starting now.

557
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,500
2.31.

558
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,380
Central time.

559
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,820
If you do not do these couplings,

560
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,460
you make a mockery of the sacred institution of marriage.

561
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,320
You can't do that.

562
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,680
So ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

563
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,420
it is done.

564
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,120
A men and a women and a wine mind.

565
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,540
It's like, there you go again.

566
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,460
You can't limit this stuff.

567
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,640
The hems and the heres and whatever,

568
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,140
all your, let all the pronouns,

569
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,780
bloom.

570
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
There you go.

571
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,040
Didn't Mao say that or something?

572
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,580
Anyway.

573
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,220
Now that could have been the end of the sermon.

574
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,640
But, guess what?

575
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,820
After 20 years,

576
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,660
we raised the price of subgenius ministership.

577
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,980
Some of you should have joined up last year.

578
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,860
Because after 20 years,

579
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,220
the price of salvation,

580
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,420
or triple your money back,

581
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,380
eternal salvation,

582
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,520
or triple your money back,

583
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,380
has leapt from $35 to $50.

584
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,940
It now costs twice as much

585
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,700
to make these holy ordainment kits.

586
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,520
Here, let me get one.

587
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,440
It's full of crap.

588
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,380
I mean, there's all kinds of stuff in here.

589
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,940
Stickers, these huge doctorates and excuses,

590
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,480
a button, the minister's card,

591
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,080
all kinds of portraits of Bob,

592
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,740
and many, many documents.

593
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,460
That costs us twice as much to make that stuff,

594
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,560
and yet we're only charging you 50% more.

595
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,640
And today, today only,

596
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,180
you're just in time for the 10% discount.

597
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,900
So it's really only $44.99.

598
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,220
That's nothing.

599
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,780
It's as if we only raised the price by $10.

600
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,920
Can you believe these incredible price ups?

601
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,820
We must be insane!

602
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,780
A sure sign of madness of the end times, my friend,

603
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,140
when you see us raise our prices.

604
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,500
We just must be crazy.

605
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,580
If the conspiracy doom and gloom boys got you in a spin,

606
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,380
we'll just wait until Bob puts his hand on the merry-go-round.

607
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,480
You'll end up on your head

608
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,360
when you see all these all-new prices

609
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,580
for the same damn things.

610
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,180
We also raised the price of our T-shirts

611
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,920
and a few other things.

612
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,740
Little pins and such.

613
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,160
We're running at top speed

614
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,180
just to stay in the same place,

615
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,600
keeping up with you,

616
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,380
the choosy cult customer.

617
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,580
Now see, we really thought we were kidding

618
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,320
about the end times.

619
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,940
We thought we were exaggerating,

620
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,580
and we didn't really expect everything

621
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,680
to start happening so fast,

622
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,940
just like the most absurd predictions

623
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,740
in the book of the subgenius,

624
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
mostly put together in 1981.

625
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,960
If you look through the dateline for dominance,

626
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,320
it is frightening how much of that stuff

627
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,280
really did come true.

628
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,380
We had the times wrong,

629
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,100
but then we had 1998 wrong.

630
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,020
That ain't our fault.

631
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,360
As Onan Kenobite said,

632
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,920
there's still time for things to get a-hawking.

633
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,680
And it's a whole lot worse.

634
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,940
I met a politician with blood up to his elbows

635
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,580
proclaiming his virtue

636
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,020
compared to a politician with blood up to his shoulders.

637
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,020
But you can be neck deep

638
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,920
in the slurry trough of a spiritual abattoir

639
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,000
when you join the church of the subgenius.

640
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Let us choose how we're going to be screwed.

641
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,600
Some ways cost more.

642
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,920
By two memberships,

643
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,000
and put one in a time capsule,

644
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,120
in the past.

645
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,020
You can trick yourself that way.

646
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,540
It'll be fun.

647
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,000
As Bob Dobbs so famously told Ronald Reagan,

648
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,640
a rising price lifts all hearts.

649
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:31,040
And hence we have the dribble-down economy,

650
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,180
where somehow the rich just get richer and richer.

651
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Dang.

652
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,920
You know, when you become a subgenius minister,

653
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,100
it's traditional to adopt a new name,

654
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,660
you know, a church name.

655
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,000
Often times they're clever puns.

656
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,420
And some people, I've learned,

657
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,360
hold back because they haven't thought of a good enough new name.

658
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,480
If you've been holding back from joining the church,

659
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,760
here's some spare names that haven't been used.

660
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,860
But you'll have to fight over them yourself.

661
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,180
And you'll have to fight over them yourself.

662
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,180


663
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,600
Reverend Will Harshmallow.

664
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,080
Reverend Anna Falaxis.

665
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,860
These haven't been used yet.

666
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,900
Reverend Oki Boomer.

667
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,740
Reverend Mark O'Kane.

668
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
Marco DeBeast.

669
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,020
Reverend Joe Scognew.

670
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,400
And, uh, well, no, Reverend Funnyname is taken.

671
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,240
That one's already taken.

672
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,080
And this is where I could end.

673
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,660
I have sort of a new rant ending.

674
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,660
They erased the previous one.

675
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm actually staying 2.0, by the way.

676
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,700
I think.

677
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,720
We're working on a Bob 2.0 AI.

678
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,580
And I'm not kidding, by the way.

679
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,820
Well, we're hoping work will begin on Bob 2.0, the AI version.

680
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,700
Because, you know, we can't, it's real hard to meet Bob in person.

681
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,200
But unlike other people, he can survive the laser scanning of the brain.

682
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,180
Usually scanning the brain to that degree would kill a normal human.

683
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,720
But Bob is no normal human.

684
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,460
And he doesn't need that much.

685
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,220
Because it's not brains.

686
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
It's not about brains.

687
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,240
Subgenius.

688
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,240
It's about luck.

689
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,860
Bob is not smart.

690
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,400
He's lucky.

691
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,640
He said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

692
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,620
He may not have been the very first person to say that.

693
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,080
But anyway, my new rant ending is, uh,

694
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,100
Ignorance is freedom.

695
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,700
Slavery is peace.

696
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,900
Dobbs is slack.

697
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,500
Send one dollar.

698
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,920
But nobody ever sends one dollar, by the way.

699
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,860
That doesn't happen to me.

700
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,700
I used to pay for my kids' lunch money with the dollars that came from people sending a dollar.

701
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,820
And they got a pamphlet back.

702
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
Back then, the pamphlets didn't cost a dollar to print.

703
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,900
Nor 55 cents to mail.

704
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,380
And you could just kind of tape the edges shut and write the address right on the pamphlet.

705
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,980
No envelope.

706
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,780
That never, ever happens anymore.

707
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,640
Because these are the end times.

708
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:43,360
But you're lucky, friends, because you have coming up Fat Man D and Tommy Amoeba.

709
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:50,220
And the last time I saw them put on a show here, it may have been the Starwood Zoom.

710
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,440
It was fabulous.

711
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,740
Tommy's carefully constructed set fell down behind him.

712
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,400
Almost as if it was meant to happen.

713
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,560
That proves that Tommy Amoeba is a true subgenius.

714
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,400
That's actually the end of my staged rant.

715
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,140
Actually, I have a rant here I could read to you by Onan.

716
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,480
It's not by me.

717
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,580
I'm just not angry enough anymore.

718
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,940
Isn't that weird?

719
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,300
Now, we could do a question.

720
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,660
I don't have any questions except for my deafness.

721
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,940
Can I turn on...

722
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,960
Oh, I can turn on the chat.

723
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Yeah.

724
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,740
I can see...

725
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,280
Now I see the chat.

726
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,740
Oh, everybody typed Praise Bob.

727
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,980
But you didn't spell Bob's name right.

728
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,240
It doesn't count unless you put quotes on it.

729
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,800
You have to put the quotes.

730
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,440
If you really mean Bob Dobbs, you have to put the quotes on his name.

731
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,860
Because that contains him.

732
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,500
That's a ward to keep his power from leaking off of his name

733
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,460
and taking your last vestige of free will.

734
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,120
It's that powerful of a name.

735
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,200
That's why those quotes must be there.

736
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,100
It's really important.

737
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,560
It also signifies to the really cultish subgeniuses

738
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,540
if you're just an amateur.

739
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,220
They'll tear you apart on Facebook for that.

740
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,080
Speaking of which, I have not been on Facebook a lot lately.

741
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,260
I used to really be involved in social media.

742
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,140
Long before Facebook or even MySpace,

743
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,760
we used Usenet in the 90s.

744
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,560
I spent all day doing that crap.

745
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,800
Facebook came along and I really enjoyed that.

746
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,920
And I still do skim it.

747
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,540
I lurk quite a bit.

748
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,640
I only let people be friends that I know personally.

749
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,840
So if anybody here has tried to be friends,

750
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,680
it's not that I'm a snob.

751
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,900
It's that I'm careful.

752
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,640
And have limited time, you might say.

753
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm trying to use my time the best way.

754
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,060
Which lately has been preserving the physical stuff

755
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,720
that has been created.

756
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,120
And making sure that there is a new sacred scribe

757
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,600
to handle this crap after I board the saucers.

758
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,400
Which I'm not expecting to any time soon.

759
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,480
But I'm 68.

760
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,740
You see how I wore my hat?

761
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,440
I wear my hat.

762
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,340
That's so you all recognize me.

763
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,160
So it's like who'd recognize the old bald man?

764
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,660
I do still have my ponytail.

765
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,580
So there you go.

766
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,160
I look like a young man from behind.

767
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,000
I have old divorcees come up to me from behind.

768
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,040
Going, say I love your long ponytail, sir.

769
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,580
Because they're thinking, oh, he's skinnier than my husband.

770
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,000
And I turn around and you can see them thinking,

771
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,560
ooh, he's a lot older than my husband too.

772
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,400
So, yeah, coming, I'm a little old man.

773
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,660
But going away, I'm a biker.

774
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,700
So that's fun here in small town rural Texas.

775
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,720
Actually, all the old cowboys have the same gray ponytail.

776
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,320
That's really common around here.

777
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,100
Okay, Onan has an optimism rant here.

778
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,360
Which I'll read, but I'll try to do it with feeling.

779
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,740
These are the end times.

780
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,060
One way or another, these are the end times.

781
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,280
By the way, get your questions ready.

782
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,180
These are the end times.

783
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,260
For some, the end times mean an expiration of clean air, potable water, food.

784
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,480
Or it means disease, decay.

785
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:52,700
Or it means a disease.

786
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,020
Or it means death.

787
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,220
For some, the end times mean the end of time.

788
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,260
A final triumph of time control as promised by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

789
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,960
The end times come to the pinks and the subgenius alike and sadly in all forms.

790
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,920
But you're hearing my voice and seeing my face.

791
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,320
And therefore, while these things are, yay, the end times,

792
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,320
fate has not seen fit to end your time at this time.

793
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,780
No, you've got some suffering in you yet and that won't go to waste.

794
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,260
Jehovah One, the alien space god, feeds on mortal suffering and seasons it with irony.

795
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,380
The same is true of all the elder gods and a few of the younger gods.

796
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,120
And there's no denying them their banquet.

797
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,720
We pray they pray.

798
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,300
The conspiracy will tell you that there's no cause for optimism.

799
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,740
The conspiracy will tell you that optimism is expecting everything to turn out right every time.

800
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,220
Everything.

801
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,300
And if everything doesn't turn right every time, then optimism has failed.

802
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,820
Since optimism fails, one should stick with the success of failure.

803
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,520
The conspiracy is great at rewarding failure when it's your failure.

804
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,640
They don't like it so much when they fail.

805
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,300
They don't even like it when you notice that they can fail.

806
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:29,320
A gentle listener, you may be surprised to learn that the subgenius has a different perspective on this matter.

807
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,660
Differently perspective.

808
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,960
For one thing, optimism is not expecting everything to turn out right every time.

809
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:45,360
Optimism is when the subgenius is foolish and amoral enough to see all of life as one great sales opportunity.

810
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,520
Whatever happens, the market is open to the sales representative.

811
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,940
The sales representative is willing to take it on the chin and come back with a grin.

812
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:04,240
Optimism is that infuriating, uncanny luck of Bob by which whatever happens is exactly what he wanted to happen as it is happening.

813
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:12,140
We really aren't sure if he has what we would consider a memory or an understanding that future events will occur.

814
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,160
He just is.

815
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,440
Actually, Time Magazine printed that.

816
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
It was a typo, but they printed...

817
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,740
They were talking about Bob and they were correcting an error and they said, Bob is.

818
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,020
The next issue they had to come back and correct it.

819
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,080
They said, well, what we meant to...

820
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,520
I was going, yeah, that's right. They finally got it right. Bob is.

821
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,380
Because Bob had been voted fraud of the century.

822
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,400
We worked our asses off on that.

823
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,120
The Discordians were trying to beat us by using Geraldo Rivera.

824
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,500
And the conspiracy was...

825
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,140
They wouldn't let people use Rush Limbaugh or L. Ron Hubbard.

826
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,580
Bob won.

827
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,540
And then they started to explain Bob and they did a misprint.

828
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:05,280
So they had to come back and say what they had meant to say about this non-existent fraud.

829
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,640
And they basically got that wrong.

830
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,960
They said Bob was invented by a band in Texas.

831
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,900
Well, there you go. That's the media for you.

832
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,900
Anyway, Bob just is.

833
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,480
Another thing is that even if we cannot quite ape the Dobby,

834
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,160
Bob's nature, we can frame optimism as the success of what we prefer to happen.

835
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,680
Not everything that happens.

836
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,820
And for sure not what the conspiracy insists must happen.

837
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,800
When somebody you don't like comes to a bad end,

838
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,160
or at least goes out and bothers somebody else for a while,

839
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,320
that's hardly everything turning right every time for them.

840
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,200
But for you, heck yeah!

841
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,800
Let those jerks get a taste of their own medicine for a change.

842
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,840
Not because it'll do them any good,

843
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,020
but because it gives you slack.

844
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,380
So you see, optimism is the evidence-based response to these end times.

845
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,400
The whole planet is doomed.

846
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,340
If the ghost dinosaurs don't get you,

847
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,620
the plastic in the placenta will.

848
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,380
If the oceans don't acidify you,

849
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,460
the social media will sizzle your very soul.

850
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:17,680
This naturally and necessarily means that they who tamper your cause

851
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,620
will endure great agony and defeat.

852
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,020
Yay!

853
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,780
Try to die last.

854
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,060
Or maybe just be glad for the simple pleasures when they come your way.

855
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,140
Keep a little spark lit to pass on to some other subgenius

856
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,460
who's even more in the dark than you are.

857
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,680
Whether you believe all it takes is a little sprinkle,

858
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,220
or whether you believe it requires full immersion,

859
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:48,180
you walk on into that water and gain the gift of Bobtism from your own hand.

860
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,100
By this sure means, ye shall know Bobtimism.

861
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,440
And you know, I believe that's the first time I've actually ever read that.

862
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,740
I printed this thing out and maybe I've just got the dementias,

863
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,840
but I don't remember.

864
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,280
For all I know, I read it on radio show Hour of Slack.

865
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,760
Hour of Slack is on all the time now.

866
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,620
We're on episode number 1876.

867
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,120
It's been on for 75 years.

868
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,800
More than 35 years.

869
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,980
Last year was the Church of the Subgenius' 40th anniversary.

870
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,960
A movie came out about us that is really good.

871
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,320
It's very entertaining.

872
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,140
It's true to life.

873
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:46,600
The lady who directed it hired the best editor and writers and writers.

874
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:46,600


875
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:46,600


876
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,220
So forth.

877
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,320
And the funny thing is, it actually is the best film about Church of the Subgenius.

878
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,720
And the director, Sandy Boone, is a Christian.

879
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,400
She had to quit her church because they went all,

880
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,360
you know.

881
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,000
And she wasn't really, you know.

882
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,260
That was sad.

883
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,820
And it was sad that the movie came out when COVID did.

884
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,380
It never was in theaters.

885
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,960
But it is streaming in a lot of places.

886
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,900
And if you go to dobstown.org,

887
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,680
there is a very concise list of all the ways to see it.

888
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,180
Like I say, Tubi, it's free.

889
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,980
I think it's like four bucks.

890
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,620
And YouTube has it, actually.

891
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,860
J.R. Bob Dobson, The Church of the Subgenius is the title.

892
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,600
Now I'm going to hawk a little bit more stuff.

893
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,540
I've got ten minutes here.

894
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,660
Are there any questions?

895
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,360
I hate when I'm talking about YouTube.

896
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,700
I hate when I nearly die, but it's better than the alternative.

897
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,320
Yeah.

898
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,420
Yep.

899
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,100
We get that.

900
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,580
As all old people say, just as if they made it up,

901
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,360
getting old ain't for sissies.

902
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,820
I really thought my mom made that up, but everybody says it.

903
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,200
Anyway, we have a new book out.

904
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,320
It's not even in the catalog yet,

905
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,980
because right now it's a special edition of only 50 numbered copies.

906
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,560
It's called The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

907
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,360
by Reverend Teters Lohan.

908
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,500
It's a great book.

909
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:15,500


910
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,540
It's the best story featuring Bob as a character that I've ever read.

911
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,700
I've written two screenplays for Subgenius Movie,

912
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,020
but if somebody came to me and said,

913
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,260
you have a screenplay, I'd give them this.

914
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,460
Honest.

915
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,220
It's really sick and really funny.

916
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,080
It takes place in the 60s.

917
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,340
It's a hardback.

918
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,180
It looks like a little golden book, doesn't it?

919
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,660
Not very big.

920
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,400
And it's about a buck a page.

921
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,460
We'll put out an affordable paperback version later.

922
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,840
But we wanted to try the special signed numbered edition

923
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,340
for the three rich people in the church.

924
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,680
We still have Neighbor World,

925
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,780
the science fiction novel by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

926
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,380
It's not specifically Subgenius oriented,

927
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,180
but it might as well be.

928
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,880
If you've ever heard Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

929
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,380
you should read Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

930
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,000
He actually is a writer.

931
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,580
He worked as a newspaper reporter and article writer.

932
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,280
And we have a science fiction subgenius book,

933
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,540
the first subgenius novel,

934
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,620
Eyelash, by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley.

935
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,540
It takes place partly on the eyelash of a Yakutizma,

936
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,960
which is a giant planet-eating robot.

937
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,860
Bob is in it.

938
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,400
But the main characters are a couple of subgeniuses

939
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,620
and an exist,

940
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,400
a man from Planet X

941
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,780
who happens to be in the body of a buxom woman.

942
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,400
So, you know, the movie would sell, I guess.

943
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,200
Anyway, and of course, we still have the book of the subgenius.

944
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,040
Still in print.

945
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,800
30 years in print.

946
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,940
Over 100,000 copies sold.

947
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,040
And unbelievable numbers bootlegged

948
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,640
in crappy PDF form.

949
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,440
I just got a letter from some guy.

950
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,720
He wanted to join the members-only group,

951
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,520
Scrub Genius.

952
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,880
And I actually check these people.

953
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:28,300
I said, we don't have Neo-Weirdo 2525 in our records.

954
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,900
He goes, oh, I never spent any money,

955
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,500
but I've worked really hard to download the PDFs

956
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,260
of all your books.

957
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,440
And I was like, gee, thanks, bub.

958
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,740
It actually was a funny exchange.

959
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,020
I'm not a scrub genius.

960
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,300
I'm not as cranky as I used to be.

961
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:44,920
Oddly.

962
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,620
So, there you go.

963
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,080
Any other, any questions?

964
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,560
My dimensions are 2x4, personally.

965
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,400
Oh, that's, hi Spencer.

966
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,440
Which one is, I don't know if I can see everybody.

967
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,080
Okay, friends, it's almost time.

968
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,460
It's time for me to get the heck out of here.

969
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,480
Thank you very, very much

970
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,900
for attending this virtual devival.

971
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,420
There's no greater honor than to be paid attention to.

972
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,580
Spencer is attending from Ireland,

973
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,020
and he said, hi, uncle.

974
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,280
Oh, okay.

975
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,000
Actually, Onan is the uncle.

976
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,620
Okay.

977
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,980
Although I'm an uncle, too.

978
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,980
I just wanted you to know.

979
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,480
Our two nephews live right here on the property,

980
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,820
but luckily, not very close by.

981
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,000
It's great.

982
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,940
Nobody lives here but my family,

983
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,460
but they all have their own nephews.

984
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:41,700
They all have their own houses,

985
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,760
and they're not all crammed together.

986
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,640
It's so wonderful.

987
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,740
Well, most of my family.

988
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,140
There's one still missing.

989
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,940
But I can't wait to see Fat Mandy and Tommy Amoeba.

990
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,740
They're the greatest.

991
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,900
There's Tommy right now.

992
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:00,820
Oh!

993
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,480
Oh!

994
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,340
Thank you, and praise Bob.

995
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,700
I shall now formally leave,

996
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,560
so that I may come back in a minute.

997
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,240
I'll put that movie on.

998
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,640
You don't have to leave.

999
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,700
I know.

1000
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,420
But it's just a formality.

1001
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,200
I'll choose a video background.

1002
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,420
Now I can go to the bathroom, see.

1003
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,680
I did think of that.

1004
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,580
I did do that first.

1005
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,340
Thank you for listening.

1006
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,380
This is Hour of Slack.

1007
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,340
And you can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius

1008
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,340
from subgenius.com.

1009
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,900
Praise Bob.

1010
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,860
But you should You should

1011
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,880
I do.

1012
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,220
I just want to stand up.

1013
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,320
So it...

1014
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,320


1015
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,060
The father came up.

1016
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,060


1017
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,360
No!

1018
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,040
odarinei can say fo the

1019
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,880
You vintage.

1020
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:16,880


1021
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:16,880


1022
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:16,880


1023
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:16,880


1024
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Watch me!

1025
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,900
Yeah.

1026
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:24,100
Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, backed by Russia, has been carrying out an offensive Turkey news in the city center.

1027
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,180
City center.

1028
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,360
Johnson visited his troops by a tank and destroyed buildings.

1029
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,360
Turkish fighters now say they've taken control.

1030
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,880
On Twitter today, President Trump says 200 people have some PR.

1031
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,180
Trump tweets the PR reports were probably made at a later date to further their agendas.

1032
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,780
PR news.

1033
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,220
The second fashion reports.

1034
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,740
Only 3.6463.

1035
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,880
Officials in Florida say they believe all PR news.

1036
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,000
PR news.

1037
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,840
Ta-ta.

1038
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,440
Yeah.

1039
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,340
No.

1040
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,520
Yeah.

1041
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,300
No.

1042
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,140
Yeah.

1043
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:15,520
No.

1044
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,180


1045
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,740
My.

1046
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:19,740


1047
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:20,140


1048
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,300
